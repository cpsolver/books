The
o-o
Republicans
o-o
...
o-o
er, fans of
o-o
Republican
o-o
politicians,
o-o
who gave
o-o
contributions
o-o
to Obama
o-o
must've chuckled
o-o
when they
o-o
donated.
sentence-next
o-o
Then raged for days
o-o
when they got an
o-o
African
o-o
American
o-o
president.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
And that gives you
o-o
an example
o-o
of a blocking
o-o
tactic that
o-o
wouldn't work
o-o
if vote splitting
o-o
were not such a
o-o
useful gimmick
o-o
for rigging
o-o
elections.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I heard what you said.
sentence-next
o-o
But the words
o-o
leaked out
o-o
of my brain
o-o
without
o-o
leaving behind
o-o
any idea 'bout
o-o
what they mean.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
If unfair
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
were to
o-o
disappear,
o-o
then that blocking
o-o
kind of tactic
o-o
wouldn't
o-o
interfere.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
in the general
o-o
election,
o-o
each party
o-o
would offer
o-o
begin-italics two end-italics or begin-italics three end-italics
o-o
selections,
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm confused again.
sentence-next
o-o
How can there be
o-o
two Republicans
o-o
and two
o-o
Democrats
o-o
on the ballot?
sentence-next
o-o
That would cause
o-o
vote splitting.
sentence-next
o-o
Some things
o-o
are becomin'
o-o
clear.
sentence-next
o-o
But what can make
o-o
the evil split
o-o
disappear?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
I really don't know,
o-o
and don't care.
sentence-next
o-o
The political stress
o-o
was making a mess
o-o
of my ulcers.
sentence-next
o-o
Giving them
o-o
their own ulcers.
sentence-next
o-o
So I won't be
o-o
running for
o-o
re-election.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why I can
o-o
risk speaking
o-o
candidly.
sentence-next
o-o
But remember
o-o
you didn't learn
o-o
any of this
o-o
from me.
sentence-next
o-o
If you go
o-o
to newspaper
o-o
reporters
o-o
with these insights
o-o
I'll shine
o-o
light on
o-o
the skeletons
o-o
in the closet
o-o
of your friend
o-o
name-vc no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
He asked me to
o-o
help you on your
o-o
mission to earn
o-o
money using
o-o
his tricks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I won't be a
o-o
snitch or fink.
sentence-next
o-o
'N anyways I
o-o
can't yet link
o-o
the problem of
o-o
vote splittin'
o-o
to a solution.
sentence-next
o-o
One that can
o-o
defeat this
o-o
unfairness.
sentence-next
o-o
So I need to
o-o
learn more.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you know who
o-o
would know how
o-o
to fix this
o-o
mess?
sentence-next
o-o
The unfair
o-o
politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Probably
o-o
that would be
o-o
a professor
o-o
of mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aiee!
sentence-next
o-o
Scholastic
o-o
gymnastics!
sentence-next
o-o
In math no less.
sentence-next
o-o
That's too
o-o
advanced.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm almost
o-o
peeing
o-o
in my pants,
o-o
it scares me so!
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Well I've got to go.
sentence-next
o-o
I wish you luck
o-o
in understanding
o-o
yet more
o-o
so maybe someday
o-o
you can help clean up
o-o
the muck
o-o
on the
o-o
political
o-o
stage.
sentence-next
o-o
In the meantime,
o-o
the political
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
Voters
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
assume the rich
o-o
are at
o-o
the top.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes, politicians
o-o
have all been bought.
sentence-next
o-o
But as voters
o-o
you've got
o-o
more power than
o-o
the SpaceX
o-o
rockets,
o-o
a swarm of
o-o
locusts,
o-o
and a flu
o-o
virus,
o-o
all working
o-o
together on
o-o
the same team.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you think
o-o
maybe someday
o-o
the voters
o-o
will,
o-o
uh,
o-o
...
end-lyric

o-o
ambee sings-politician amenn
...
o-o
reign
o-o
supreme?
sentence-next
o-o
Eventually.
sentence-next
o-o
Hopefully.
sentence-next
o-o
Then us
o-o
politicians
o-o
will become begin-italics your end-italics
o-o
puppets.
sentence-next
o-o
But currently
o-o
we're the puppets
o-o
of wealthy
o-o
business
o-o
owners.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I admit
o-o
I'm seein' a
o-o
bit of hope 
o-o
for a fix.
sentence-next
o-o
To get less
o-o
dysfunctional
o-o
politics.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I know the
o-o
greedy rich
o-o
distract us with
o-o
left versus right.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet up versus down,
o-o
that's the real fight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You're bright.
sentence-next
o-o
Good luck!
sentence-next
o-o
But don't forget,
o-o
it was some
o-o
other schmuck
o-o
who gave you
o-o
the tour of the
o-o
elephant and
o-o
donkey muck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thank you
o-o
for tiltin'
o-o
my brain
o-o
to better see
o-o
the political
o-o
terrain.
sentence-next
o-o
You've saved me
o-o
from going
o-o
insane.
