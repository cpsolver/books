ambee sings-politician amenn
A delegate
o-o
is someone
o-o
you vote for
o-o
and they vote for
o-o
the actual candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like the
o-o
electoral college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Sort of
o-o
like that.
sentence-next
o-o
But here
o-o
I'm talking
o-o
about a primary
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
The one before
o-o
the nomination
o-o
convention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The conventions
o-o
I know about
o-o
sell
o-o
computer games,
o-o
comic books,
o-o
and whacky
o-o
kitchen gadgets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
A political
o-o
convention
o-o
doesn't sell
o-o
anything,
o-o
at least not
o-o
directly.
sentence-next
o-o
During a
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
election,
o-o
when you vote
o-o
for a governor,
o-o
secretary of state,
o-o
or president,
o-o
you're actually
o-o
voting for
o-o
someone who
o-o
has promised
o-o
to vote for
o-o
the candidate
o-o
whose name
o-o
you mark on
o-o
your ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
Those people,
o-o
the ones who
o-o
get enough votes,
o-o
are delegates.
sentence-next
o-o
They travel to
o-o
a convention
o-o
where they
o-o
vote on your
o-o
behalf.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why isn't my vote
o-o
counted directly?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Sometimes,
o-o
none of the
o-o
candidates
o-o
gets a majority
o-o
of votes.
sentence-next
o-o
There has to be
o-o
enough support
o-o
to justify
o-o
having just one
o-o
nominee
o-o
on the
o-o
general
o-o
election
o-o
ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
So at the
o-o
convention
o-o
the delegates
o-o
do rounds
o-o
of voting
o-o
until one
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a majority,
o-o
that's half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So we're at
o-o
a nomination
o-o
convention,
o-o
where one of the
o-o
delegates
o-o
is voting
o-o
on my behalf.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
After each round
o-o
of voting,
o-o
if there's no
o-o
majority,
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the fewest
o-o
delegate votes
o-o
usually
o-o
drops out.
sentence-next
o-o
Traditionally
o-o
that candidate
o-o
tells their
o-o
delegates
o-o
who to vote for
o-o
in the next round.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm the one
o-o
spinning
o-o
round and round
o-o
in the
o-o
laundry
o-o
machine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
It can get
o-o
very messy.
sentence-next
o-o
There used to be
o-o
lots of backroom
o-o
deals involved.
sentence-next
o-o
Like promises
o-o
of political
o-o
appointments
o-o
in return for
o-o
a candidate
o-o
telling
o-o
their delegates
o-o
to vote for
o-o
the more popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
who has made
o-o
that promise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
I see,
o-o
lots of tricks
o-o
go on
o-o
to influence
o-o
the delegates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes,
o-o
sometimes
o-o
literally.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact
o-o
sexual bribery
o-o
was common
o-o
before women
o-o
got the right
o-o
to vote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoa!
sentence-next
o-o
Trading a vote
o-o
for sex?
sentence-next
o-o
That's a kind
o-o
of bribery,
o-o
...
o-o
I didn't
o-o
know about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Surely you know,
o-o
wealthy people
o-o
pay lots of
o-o
different
o-o
kinds of helpers
o-o
to influence
o-o
those of us in
o-o
government.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I hadn't known
o-o
about
o-o
bribery
o-o
using
o-o
prostitutes.
sentence-next
o-o
I suppose this
o-o
category
o-o
includes hiring
o-o
social hyphen-here media
o-o
influencers,
o-o
celebrities,
o-o
and
o-o
lobbyists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Here's another
o-o
twist.
sentence-next
o-o
At the
o-o
Democratic
o-o
national
o-o
election,
o-o
where a
o-o
presidential
o-o
candidate
o-o
is chosen,
o-o
there are
o-o
super delegates
o-o
who weren't
o-o
elected by
o-o
the voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow,
o-o
super
o-o
extra
o-o
layers
o-o
of corrup...,
o-o
of extra
o-o
influence.
sentence-next
o-o
Just to get
o-o
this
o-o
majority
o-o
thingy.
sentence-next
o-o
Why is that
o-o
so damned
o-o
important?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
There's something
o-o
in politics
o-o
called
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What do spittin'
o-o
goats have to do
o-o
with politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not goats.
sentence-next
o-o
Votes.
sentence-next
o-o
As in voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Vote spittin'?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not spitting,
o-o
although
o-o
spitting
o-o
used to happen
o-o
in Congress
o-o
so often
o-o
they had
o-o
spittoons.
sentence-next
o-o
It's splitting,
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
and it's the
o-o
election version
o-o
of divide and
o-o
conquer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N divide 'n
o-o
conquer.
sentence-next
o-o
Isn't that the
o-o
battle tactic
o-o
armies use when
o-o
they separate
o-o
enemy
o-o
soldiers from
o-o
one another?
sentence-next
o-o
'N then they can
o-o
attack the
o-o
smaller groups
o-o
when they're
o-o
aloner?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes, and in fact,
o-o
voting is
o-o
rooted in war
o-o
and fighting.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why women
o-o
didn't vote.
sentence-next
o-o
They weren't counted
o-o
because they
o-o
don't fight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those rule makers
o-o
never met my
o-o
uncle's
o-o
ex hyphen-here wife.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
So voting
o-o
started out
o-o
as counting
o-o
to figure
o-o
out how many
o-o
men would be
o-o
in each army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And two small armies
o-o
would lose against
o-o
one bigger army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes,
o-o
if the big army
o-o
can fight just one
o-o
small army
o-o
at a time.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what dividing
o-o
the enemy enables.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why Lincoln
o-o
said a house divided
o-o
cannot stand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, so long ago
o-o
votin' began
o-o
as a way to
o-o
count potential
o-o
army sizes.
sentence-next
o-o
'N the smaller
o-o
army surrenders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Saves a lot of dying,
o-o
no?
sentence-next
o-o
And when splitting
o-o
can't be done
o-o
physically,
o-o
then splitting
o-o
psychologically
o-o
works too.
sentence-next
o-o
In politics,
o-o
that's what
o-o
religious
o-o
and racial
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences
o-o
do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how does this
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Well, it involves
o-o
math.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o
ya mean,
o-o
mathematics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Certainly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In my opinion
o-o
math's the devil's
o-o
favorite
o-o
form of torture.
sentence-next
o-o
If I had to
o-o
choose between
o-o
doin' just one page
o-o
of math homework,
o-o
or standin' under
o-o
a tall fir tree
o-o
gettin' cut down,
o-o
I'd be there
o-o
yellin' begin-italics timber! end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
I don't like it
o-o
either.
sentence-next
o-o
And I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
well enough to
o-o
clearly
o-o
explain how it
o-o
all works.
sentence-next
o-o
I just know that
o-o
it works.
sentence-next
o-o
So we, the
o-o
politicians,
o-o
are effectively
o-o
hobbled and
o-o
handcuffed
o-o
and gagged
o-o
when we cast
o-o
our votes in
o-o
Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ya said there's
o-o
distractions.
sentence-next
o-o
How can just
o-o
distractions
o-o
hide this vote
o-o
splittin'
o-o
so effectively?
end-lyric
