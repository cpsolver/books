Trading a vote

That's a kind

Here's another

twist.
sentence-next
o-o
At the

Democratic

national
o-o
election,
o-o
where a
o-o
presidential
o-o
candidate

is chosen,
o-o
there are
o-o
super delegates
o-o
who weren't

elected by

the voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow,
o-o
super
o-o
extra

layers
o-o
of corrup...,
o-o
of extra

influence.
sentence-next
o-o
Just to get

this

majority

thingy.
sentence-next
o-o
Why is that
o-o
so damned
o-o
important?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
There's something
o-o
in politics
o-o
called
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What do spittin'
o-o
goats have to do
o-o
with politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not goats.
sentence-next
o-o
Votes.
sentence-next
o-o
As in voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Vote spittin'?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not spitting,
o-o
although
o-o
spitting
o-o
used to happen
o-o
in Congress
o-o
so often
o-o
they had
o-o
spittoons.
sentence-next
o-o
It's splitting,
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
and it's the
o-o
election version
o-o
of divide and
o-o
conquer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N divide 'n

sentence-next
o-o
Isn't that the
o-o
battle tactic
o-o
armies use when
o-o
they separate
o-o
enemy
o-o
soldiers from
o-o
one another?
sentence-next
o-o
'N then they can
o-o
attack the

smaller groups
o-o
when they're
o-o
aloner?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes, and in fact,
o-o
voting is
o-o
rooted in war
o-o
and fighting.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why women
o-o
didn't vote.
sentence-next
o-o
They weren't counted
o-o
because they
o-o
don't fight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those rule makers
o-o
never met my
o-o
uncle's
o-o
ex hyphen-here wife.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
So voting
o-o
started out
o-o
as counting
o-o
to figure
o-o
out how many
o-o
men would be
o-o
in each army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And two small armies
o-o
would lose against
o-o
one bigger army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes,
o-o
if the big army
o-o
can fight just one
o-o
small army
o-o
at a time.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what dividing
o-o
the enemy enables.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why Lincoln
o-o
said a house divided
o-o
cannot stand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, so long ago
o-o
votin' began
o-o
as a way to

count potential

army sizes.

o-o
'N the smaller
o-o
army surrenders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Saves a lot of dying,
o-o
no?
sentence-next
o-o
And when splitting
o-o
can't be done
o-o
physically,
o-o
then splitting
o-o
psychologically
o-o
works too.
sentence-next
o-o
In politics,
o-o
that's what
o-o
religious
o-o
and racial
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences
o-o
do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how does this
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Well, it involves
o-o
math.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o
ya mean,
o-o
mathematics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Certainly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In my opinion
o-o
math's the devil's

favorite

form of torture.

If I had to

end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
I don't like it

either.
sentence-next
o-o
And I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
well enough to
o-o
clearly
o-o
explain how it
o-o
all works.
sentence-next
o-o
I just know that
o-o
it works.
sentence-next
o-o
So we, the
o-o
politicians,
o-o
are effectively
o-o
hobbled and
o-o
handcuffed
o-o
and gagged
o-o
when we cast
o-o
our votes in
o-o
Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ya said there's
o-o
distractions.

o-o
How can just

splittin'

so effectively?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You've heard of

those're 'bout the

attention hyphen-here grabbin'
o-o
fight between

Republicans

Democrats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's why news

reporters
o-o
are not blocked
o-o
from writing and
o-o
speaking about those
o-o
unfairness
o-o
topics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Which now I know
o-o
helps distract from,

o-o
the bigger fight
o-o
between
o-o
political up
o-o
'n
o-o
political down.
end-lyric

And you've heard of

the money bonus

get if they get
o-o
more than a

certain percent

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aha!
sentence-next
o-o
That's a tactic
o-o
to split votes
o-o
away from
o-o
...
o-o
well who?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
In the U.S.,
o-o
third parties
o-o
are mostly
o-o
on the left.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why is that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
The political right
o-o
has more money.
sentence-next
o-o
So the leader
o-o
of a small
o-o
conservative
o-o
party
o-o
gets a bribe
o-o
to stand aside.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those leaders
o-o
fall for that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Wouldn't you
o-o
if they

offered you

a political

job with a good salary?

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I admit the

tricked hyphen-here out

RV

parked in

Tahiti
o-o
would

do it.
end-lyric

and

indirectly
o-o
donate

money to

boost third parties

That splits votes
o-o
away from the

Democratic

nominee.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
sentence-next

It just affects the

And if a

That concentrates

conservative

voters' ballots

on the single

nominee.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N now I see
