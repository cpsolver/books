That's why news

In the U.S.,

third parties

o-o
So the leader

gets a bribe

I admit the

do it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Also the

quietly

and

indirectly
o-o
donates

money to

boost third parties

And now I see

To deal with that
o-o
the political

down hires critics

who write

biased comments

The divide

The winning

strategy

came to be

for each party

o-o
The idea was

to discover

Correct so far.
