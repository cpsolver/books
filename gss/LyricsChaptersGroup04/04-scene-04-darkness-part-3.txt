I've hit a
o-o
turning point.
sentence-next
o-o
Originally
o-o
I thought the
o-o
enemy was
o-o
capitalism,
o-o
and that
o-o
socialism
o-o
was the
o-o
opposite.
sentence-next
o-o
But it's not
o-o
that simple.
end-lyric

Republicans
o-o
to win.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I too just learned

between
o-o
left and right's
o-o
just a
o-o
distraction
o-o
tactic.
sentence-next
o-o
It's like what

does.
end-lyric

Mistreat rabbits?

o-o
the sneaky
o-o
trick.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now that I
o-o
know the

unravel
o-o
that puzzle.
end-lyric

o-o
struggle?

o-o
or the big

campaign contributors?
end-lyric

Whoever
o-o
is most to blame.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
From what I
o-o
can tell,
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
and even slimy
o-o
politicians
o-o
are mostly
o-o
clueless.
sentence-next
o-o
They know that
o-o
money works like
o-o
puppet strings,
o-o
but they don't
o-o
understand
o-o
the details

about why.

sentence-next
o-o
I want a light

o-o
that even evil
o-o
money huggers
o-o
and egotistic
o-o
puppets
o-o
cannot fight back.
sentence-next
o-o
Not with their wealth,
o-o
not with lawyers,
o-o
and not with
o-o
help from my
o-o
distant cousin

that attack
o-o
political
o-o
candidates.

majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whatever it takes?
sentence-next
o-o
Yeah, it seems
o-o
it'll take some
o-o
lookin' into
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm willing to
o-o
help you fight
