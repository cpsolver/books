<h1>About <i>The Goat Spitting Secret</i></h1>
<p class="para_standard">This comedy is a dialog in which the characters Damien and Desha learn about ranked choice voting.&#160; Also they learn why a well-designed election system will bring widespread economic prosperity.</p> <p class="para_standard">A young carpenter named Damien struggles to understand why the worlds of business and politics are upside-down for himself, his fianc&#233;, and for his generation.&#160; He flunked out of community college so he gets assistance from Desha who is a wild young woman with a degree in political science.&#160; Together they meet in secret with wise mentors who help them dig under layers of political dung, teach them important insights that school textbooks fail to teach, and reveal the hidden path that will flip the world right-side up.&#160; What they learn reveals why the United States Congress lacks a backbone and couldn't escape from a soggy cardboard box lying on its side.&#160; In the exciting conclusion several worlds collide in surprising ways.</p> <p class="para_standard">Here's what one reader wrote:&#160; <i>Personally I found myself so much better informed about how the world works.</i></p> <p class="para_standard">If you are angry at the craziness going on in U.S. politics, if you're frustrated that low wages aren't keeping up with high inflation, if you fear yet more school shootings, and if you recognize that Republican and Democratic members of Congress are acting like candy-fueled kids in kindergarten just before nap time, please take time to learn the big secret you'll want to share with your friends.</p> <p class="para_standard">Can't wait to learn the secret?&#160; The secret in a nutshell is called <i>pairwise vote counting</i>.&#160; It will be used in general elections to count ranked choice ballots.&#160; What does this mean?&#160; Read the story to join Damien and Desha in their insightful adventure!&#160; Or if you prefer to immediately jump to details about ranked choice voting, here's a link to <a href="ogss_05.xhtml"><i>Scene 5, Math Breakthrough</i></a>.&#160; Remember to share this secret with your friends!</p> <p class="para_standard">To find out about audiobook recordings and video performances of this witty dialog, point your browser to: SolutionsCreative.com</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200112 -->&#160;So you mean extortion's the best kind of plan?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200113 -->&#160;To see what I mean, consider the music industry.&#160; The way it was years ago, before a recording studio got squeezed into a laptop computer.&#160; Back then, cutting a record, literally, meant cutting grooves on a master disk.&#160; That process used very expensive equipment to transform sound waves into vibrations of the cutting needle.&#160; That equipment was so rare that musicians would work for cheap.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200114 -->&#160;Or trade sex for a record deal?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200116 -->&#160;Oh, that's why we can't sing the Beatles song <i>Let It Be</i> in public.&#160; Now I see.&#160; Record labels lost their bottleneck because they used to monopolize the technology that now fits inside a tablet app.&#160; Aren't newspapers losing their grip too?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200118 -->&#160;Doesn't a patent provide a bottleneck?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200119 -->&#160;In theory, yeah.&#160; But really, a patent bottleneck only works for a big big invention.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200122 -->&#160;So the idea behind a monopoly is to block competitors?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200130 -->&#160;That sounds like an inside scam.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0330000 -->&#160;Like the electoral college?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_politician singer_abbrev">F<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0330003 -->&#160;A political convention doesn't sell anything.&#160; At least not directly.&#160; During a <i>primary</i> election, when you vote for a governor, secretary of state, or president, you're actually voting for someone who has promised to vote for the candidate whose name you mark on your ballot.&#160; Those people, the ones who get enough votes, are delegates.&#160; They travel to a convention where they vote on your behalf.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0330004 -->&#160;Why isn't my vote counted directly?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0330006 -->&#160;So we're at a nomination convention, where one of the delegates is voting on my behalf.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0330010 -->&#160;Oh, I see.&#160; Lots of tricks go on to influence the delegates.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_politician singer_abbrev">F<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0330025 -->&#160;Yes.&#160; In fact, voting is rooted in war and fighting.&#160; That's why women weren't allowed to vote.&#160; They weren't counted because they don't fight.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0330032 -->&#160;So how does this vote splitting work?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000048 -->&#160;Like marking both Oscar and Pinoke as a third choice?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000050 -->&#160;That's what I'd probably do.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000096 -->&#160;Are score ballots better?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670061 -->&#160;Some kinds of businesses will get a big extra tax credit if their salary gap between managers and workers is lower than most other businesses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670062 -->&#160;That would give those workers more money.&#160; Which they would spend as consumers of other businesses.&#160; Then that money flows to the employees of those other businesses.&#160; That would improve the economy of the whole region.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670063 -->&#160;Of course that wage-gap tax break has no chance of getting passed until state legislators are elected using a well-designed election system.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670064 -->&#160;That's the kind of bright future I'd like to see!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670065 -->&#160;Is there a way to measure that wage gap?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670066 -->&#160;Sure, just average the salaries below the median, and the salaries above the median, subtract them, and divide by the minimum wage.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670067 -->&#160;Median?&#160; Isn't that the barrier in a road?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670068 -->&#160;It's also a math word.&#160; Here it means the half-way salary.&#160; So he's saying to split the employees into two groups of equal size.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0670069 -->&#160;A small number for the wage-gap index means managers and executives are sharing more of the profits with their employees who get the lower salaries.&#160; So those businesses get rewarded with a bigger tax break.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690002 -->&#160;This wage-gap calculation also covers most of that gender gap.&#160; Remember, a higher percentage of women choose to become dental hygienists rather than dentists.&#160; And become performers on Broadway rather than traders on Wall Street.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690003 -->&#160;And public school teachers rather than greedy real estate developers.&#160; Yes, this fits.&#160; Finally women will get a long overdue pay lift!&#160; I'm seeing a bright future now.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690007 -->&#160;An overdue innovation is a dishwasher-sized kitchen appliance that will do food prep using robotics controlled by artificial intelligence and remote workers in distant countries.&#160; It will peel and chop potatoes and onions and such.&#160; In addition to washing dishes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690008 -->&#160;Wow!&#160; I'd rather have that kitchen prep machine than a self-driving car.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690010 -->&#160;Unfortunately that's blocked because of our dysfunctional patent system.&#160; Some kind of open patent system will help.

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690011 -->&#160;I would love to get hired to help invent that machine.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690012 -->&#160;I suppose those future solutions are blocked by feedback loops?&#160; Bad ones.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690013 -->&#160;Indeed.&#160; I suggest you look for a way to drill a hole through the dam that holds back the flood of fairness and economic prosperity that civilization is waiting for.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690014 -->&#160;It seems like feedback loops are bad, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690015 -->&#160;Most feedback loops, the economic kind, are good for some people and bad for others.&#160; Or the loop can be both good and bad for the same person.&#160; Like when Henry Ford paid his workers higher than usual salaries.&#160; That increased his labor costs.&#160; Yet also it increased his profits because more of his employees bought Ford cars.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690016 -->&#160;I'm realizing that when business owners defend their jumbo-sized slices of savory pie, they fail to recognize the people they fight against include their customers.&#160; And potential customers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690017 -->&#160;Wow, I have a lot yet to learn about feedback loops.&#160; I wish there were tutorial videos about the games of elections and economics.&#160; Like there are for computer games.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690019 -->&#160;For your needs the most important part of game theory is better vote counting.&#160; Professor Mata said you already learned those basics.&#160; Everything we discussed today is about playing games in politics and government and business.&#160; I taught you some important concepts.&#160; But I avoided teaching you the terminology.&#160; That's messier than your dog poop loop.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690020 -->&#160;Wow!&#160; You're a super duper wise guru.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690022 -->&#160;But my head is full!&#160; Yet now, hopefully, I can better figure out how to earn money as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690023 -->&#160;To do that you need to understand that entrepreneurs need to team up with the right people.&#160; Think of it like the end credits of a movie.&#160; The best movies have lots and lots of names in the credits.&#160; You need to understand which role fits your skills.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690024 -->&#160;I want to be an inventor.&#160; And I know I need to find a financial backer.&#160; To pay the cost of getting a patent.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690025 -->&#160;It takes lots of money to protect a patent.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690026 -->&#160;I thought getting a patent was the hard part.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690027 -->&#160;That's just a start.&#160; If it's a valuable idea then other businesses will infringe on your patent.&#160; So you have to take them to court to protect your monopoly.&#160; And patent laws favor big corporations.&#160; And China mostly ignores patents.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690028 -->&#160;That sucks.&#160; Is there a way to ..., I don't know, to win in the business world?&#160; For someone like me?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690029 -->&#160;The open patent I mentioned will help.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690030 -->&#160;How will that work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690031 -->&#160;After the open patent system is adopted, you'll register your idea with the patent office for a fee that's reasonable.&#160; And without having to hire a patent attorney.&#160; You will get a patent number.&#160; The government will collect and keep the licensing fees from companies that make and sell what you invented.&#160; You will put your patent number on your r&#233;sum&#233;.&#160; Then corporations will compete to hire you to invent yet more.&#160; Then your employer will pay the very high costs of getting and protecting monopoly patents that cover your newer inventions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690032 -->&#160;It sounds like graduate school for inventors.&#160; First you work for almost free.&#160; Then you get hired at a big salary!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690033 -->&#160;That path doesn't yet exist.&#160; So what should I do?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690034 -->&#160;Currently corporations don't know how to hire, or even recognize, creative geniuses.&#160; Not until after they have been the co-founder of a wildly successful start up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690035 -->&#160;That's a very tall wall to climb.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690036 -->&#160;Yes, alas.&#160; Hopefully, eventually, that inefficiency will get solved.&#160; Perhaps with the open patent.&#160; Then the economy will transform from a roller coaster ride into a rocket ship blasting into outer space.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690037 -->&#160;So solutions are waiting for when there's less stupidity in politics, business, management, and the patent system.&#160; That's a zit-sized light at the end of a marathon-long tunnel.&#160; Is there any hope?&#160; For a fairer economy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690038 -->&#160;Look at history.&#160; Civilization has increased efficiency so much that us average folks don't waste big parts of our day hauling water, gathering firewood, tending horses, and pounding underwear against rocks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690039 -->&#160;Now we waste too much time typing messages and driving cars.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690042 -->&#160;Those time wasters and other inefficiencies in the economy will increasingly disappear.&#160; After we adopt better-designed vote-counting systems for Congress and state legislatures.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690043 -->&#160;I'm discouraged by the setbacks.&#160; The ones going on now in politics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690044 -->&#160;In the past there have been huge setbacks too.&#160; Much bigger ones.&#160; The ancient Greeks two thousand years ago made clock-like computers that predicted eclipses.&#160; One of those was found in a shipwreck off the island of Antikythera.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690045 -->&#160;Who was the creative genius behind that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0690046 -->&#160;Probably either Posidonius or Hipparchus was involved.&#160; Sadly, warfare killed their knowledge.&#160; Those kinds of mechanisms weren't developed again until the Islamic Golden Age.&#160; In a similar way, the footsteps on the moon might remain unmatched for decades.</p>

<h1>About author Richard Fobes</h1>
<p class="para_standard">Richard Fobes is the author of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i> which is a how-to book on creative problem solving.&#160; It has been published around the world in ten languages.</p> <p class="para_standard">The story of <i>The Goat Spitting Secret</i> arose in Richard's mind as a dialog between different voices in his head.&#160; These different voices arose because Richard has experienced, at least briefly, being a corporate CEO, homeless person, commodity trader, manual laborer, business owner, hardware store clerk, landlord, renter, only male or only native English speaker in a household, member of a Christian religion created by a woman, physics student, grad student, atmospheric scientist, software developer, contract technical writer, neighborhood organizer, election-method expert, inventor, dance performance group leader, and dance instructor.</p> <p class="para_standard">Richard does not regard either the Republican party or the Democratic party to be representative of his political views.&#160; He registers with one party or the other just so he can vote for candidates in primary elections.&#160; He switches that registration periodically.</p> <p class="para_standard">Richard's understanding of vote counting started when he was in a small music-and-dance organization that was voting on a new logo design.&#160; The worst of the three designs came close to winning because the two better designs were similar.&#160; This experience triggered his aha moment about vote splitting.&#160; That insight led to creating an innovative vote-counting method and including it in <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>, developing further aspects of VoteFair Ranking and writing a book about it titled <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i>, creating interactive websites at VoteFair.org and NegotiationTool.com, and testifying to the Oregon state legislature and the City of Portland Charter Commission in support of well-chosen ways to count <i>ranked choice ballots</i>.</p> <p class="para_standard">Richard started life in southern California (Oceanside, at the north end of San Diego county), then moved to central California (Davis, a university town), then to mid-valley Oregon (Corvallis, another university town), and finally to northern Oregon (Portland, a big city).</p> <p class="para_standard">To see a list of projects created by Richard Fobes, including books, websites, software, and a new programming language, plus a video of him dancing, point your browser to SolutionsCreative dot com.</p> <p class="para_centered"><img style="max-width:100%" width="200" height="196" src="author.jpg" alt="Author Richard Fobes 1993"/></p> <p class="para_standard">This photo of the author was taken in early 1993 while waiting for the first printing of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>.</p>

<h1>Voice Actor Casting Suggestions</h1>
<p class="para_standard">These voice descriptions reveal the author's intention for the character voices.&#160; At the end of the list are voice descriptions that apply to all characters.</p> <p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000009 -->&#160;<b>Damien</b>, young adult male, tenor voice.&#160; Slight Puerto Rican accent.&#160; In earlier scenes uses slightly lazy pronunciation (such as <i>lookin'</i> instead of <i>looking</i> and <i>'cause</i> instead of <i>because</i>) on non-important words.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000001 -->&#160;<b>Katerina</b>, young adult female, soprano or alto voice.&#160; Speaks as though raised in an upper middle-class family.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000002 -->&#160;<b>Jordan Morton</b>, middle-age adult male, baritone voice.&#160; Speaks boldly as if wealthy.&#160;</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_politician singer_abbrev">F<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000003 -->&#160;<b>Fred Finckhster</b>, older adult male, tenor voice.&#160; Speaks like an experienced politician.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000005 -->&#160;<b>Professor Mata</b>, middle-age female, soprano or alto voice.&#160; Sounds like a university professor.&#160; Clear enunciation is important.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_econhist singer_abbrev">P<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000006 -->&#160;<b>Professor Pengaritihas</b>, middle-age male, tenor voice.&#160; Slight Indian accent, as if he is the son of immigrants from India.&#160; (At least pronounces <i>the</i> as <i>thee</i> rather than <i>thuh</i>.)&#160; Sounds like a university professor.&#160; Clear enunciation is important.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_minister singer_abbrev">W<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000007 -->&#160;<b>Whit</b> (pronounced like <i>wit</i>), middle-age male, tenor voice.&#160; Sounds like a wise minister or clergyman.&#160; Racially he sounds like he could be the father of Desha.&#160; Clear enunciation is important.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_father_of_fiance singer_abbrev">H<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000008 -->&#160;<b>Hawken</b>, middle-age male, bass or baritone voice.&#160; Sounds like a pompous wealthy person.</p>
<p class="para_standard">Additional characteristics for specific characters are revealed in the dialog.</p> <p class="para_standard"><b>Voice suggestions for all characters:</b>&#160; The voices should be natural (full-throated and conversational), lively (with frequent emotion-based pitch inflections although virtually never in the middle of a syllable, and with word-specific loudness changes), and smiling (comedic, but not <i>funny</i>), without any shouting.&#160; The rhythm should be free-form and improvisational without being specified by written notation or metronome-like timing.&#160; When words rhyme without being at the ends of sentences or phrases, a slight timing or emphasis adjustment can help the rhyming to be heard at least subconsciously.&#160; The voice acting should not be self-conscious.</p>
