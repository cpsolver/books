ambee sings-damien amenn
Since efficiency
o-o
is so important,
o-o
economists
o-o
measure it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
They think they do.
sentence-next
o-o
They have
o-o
something
o-o
called the
o-o
productivity
o-o
index.
sentence-next
o-o
But it's flawed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
sentence-next
o-o
You do remember
o-o
some economics.
sentence-next
o-o
The productivity
o-o
index
o-o
is supposed to
o-o
measure
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which is similar
o-o
to efficiency.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet that index
o-o
increases
o-o
when a house
o-o
burns down
o-o
and then
o-o
inexpensively
o-o
gets rebuilt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course it
o-o
would be even
o-o
more efficient
o-o
if the house
o-o
never burned down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Measuring
o-o
non hyphen-here destruction,
o-o
alas that's not
o-o
a sexy topic
o-o
that attracts
o-o
economists'
o-o
attention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And that index
o-o
fails to
o-o
account for
o-o
the benefits
o-o
of unpaid
o-o
volunteers
o-o
working in
o-o
public
o-o
libraries,
o-o
and the
o-o
benefits
o-o
of better
o-o
public
o-o
education.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if efficiency
o-o
is what made the
o-o
Roman empire
o-o
great,
o-o
why did it
o-o
decline?
sentence-next
o-o
In just a
o-o
sentence or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If all the books
o-o
on this subject
o-o
fell on you,
o-o
you'd get buried
o-o
in an avalanche
o-o
ten feet high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'll try to
o-o
oversimplify.
sentence-next
o-o
After the years of
o-o
good governance
o-o
and
o-o
prosperity,
o-o
new kinds of
o-o
corruption grew.
o-o
Plus
o-o
a huge source
o-o
of wealth
o-o
for ancient Rome
o-o
was through
o-o
conquest.
sentence-next
o-o
The Roman
o-o
army
o-o
invaded
o-o
surrounding
o-o
territories.
sentence-next
o-o
Besides
o-o
stealing
o-o
gold and jewels,
o-o
and crowns and
o-o
tiaras,
o-o
and artwork,
o-o
and sending it
o-o
back to Rome,
o-o
they installed
o-o
tax collectors.
sentence-next
o-o
And they built
o-o
churches and
o-o
installed
o-o
Christian priests
o-o
who collected
o-o
donations
o-o
and sent lots
o-o
of that wealth
o-o
to the Vatican
o-o
church in Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Farmers
o-o
usually paid
o-o
with grains and
o-o
other food
o-o
that fed
o-o
the soldiers
o-o
and the wealthy
o-o
in Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But that ends
o-o
when there's
o-o
no more regions
o-o
to conquer
o-o
and plunder,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Basically
o-o
that's the kids' book
o-o
version of the
o-o
Roman empire.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's the economic
o-o
opposite
o-o
of corruption?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This is going
o-o
to take awhile.
sentence-next
o-o
What I'm wearing
o-o
will go
o-o
out of style.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
multiple
o-o
opposites
o-o
because there are
o-o
multiple
o-o
kinds of
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet in a sense
o-o
the opposite is
o-o
the free market.
sentence-next
o-o
You know what that is,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
An ideal
o-o
free market
o-o
is very
o-o
efficient
o-o
because it's
o-o
fluid and
o-o
flexible.
sentence-next
o-o
It's also
o-o
impossible.
o-o
Yet we can get
o-o
much closer
o-o
than where
o-o
we are now.
sentence-next
o-o
We just need to
o-o
remove
o-o
unfair
o-o
artificial
o-o
boundaries.
sentence-next
o-o
Then people
o-o
are free to choose
o-o
what to buy,
o-o
what to sell,
o-o
how much to charge,
o-o
and whatever else,
o-o
without fighting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'd fight for that!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Unfortunately
o-o
corruption
o-o
puts up barriers
o-o
that are chosen
o-o
to channel money
o-o
into specific pockets.
sentence-next
o-o
Those kinds of
o-o
corruption
o-o
include
o-o
nepotism,
o-o
conflicts
o-o
of interest,
o-o
bribery,
o-o
racketeering,
o-o
guilds,
o-o
secret
o-o
societies,
o-o
fraternal
o-o
organizations,
o-o
black markets,
o-o
inept
o-o
bureaucracy,
o-o
basing
o-o
the economy
o-o
on trading favors,
o-o
and murdering
o-o
political enemies.
sentence-next
o-o
Those corrupt
o-o
barriers
o-o
reduce
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's
o-o
nepo...
sentence-next
o-o
whatever.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nepotism
o-o
is hiring
o-o
family
o-o
members.
sentence-next
o-o
And friends.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So looking
o-o
at Facebook
o-o
friends as
o-o
job candidates
o-o
isn't allowed.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm glad of that.
sentence-next
o-o
But is there really
o-o
less beer drinking
o-o
in frat houses
o-o
compared to
o-o
the past?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not that kind of
o-o
fraternal
o-o
organization.
sentence-next
o-o
I'll explain that
o-o
later.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Also explain
o-o
later about
o-o
trading favors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That part I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
myself.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Trading favors
o-o
is what they do
o-o
in places like
o-o
Russia
o-o
where the
o-o
rule of law
o-o
doesn't
o-o
always rule.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thank goodness
o-o
the rule of law
o-o
mostly
o-o
still works here,
o-o
even in
o-o
New Jersey.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On weekdays.
sentence-next
o-o
During daylight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Well,
o-o
I think I'm
o-o
getting the
o-o
general idea.
sentence-next
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
and stealing from
o-o
foreigners,
o-o
or selling to
o-o
foreigners,
o-o
is what brings
o-o
money into
o-o
a region.
sentence-next
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which causes
o-o
economic
o-o
decline.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a bit
o-o
fuzzy but ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My butt's fuzzy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If you say so.
sentence-next
o-o
I can see
o-o
it's firm.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A similar kind of
o-o
rise and fall
o-o
pattern happened
o-o
later with the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
sentence-next
o-o
It started with
o-o
efficient banking.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus improved ships
o-o
and navigation
o-o
using technology
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The compass, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the ship's
o-o
rudder.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Of course
o-o
gunpowder.
sentence-next
o-o
And the digit zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You're astute!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No my ass
o-o
didn't toot!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Astute.
sentence-next
o-o
It means your brain
o-o
just did the
o-o
equivalent of
o-o
a gymnastics
o-o
triple twist
o-o
vault
o-o
with a perfect
o-o
landing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh thanks!
sentence-next
o-o
So what kind of
o-o
corruption
o-o
ended the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of the wealth
o-o
going to Rome
o-o
came from
o-o
churches
o-o
around Europe
o-o
that heavily
o-o
taxed their
o-o
members.
sentence-next
o-o
That wealth
o-o
is still visible
o-o
today in the
o-o
Vatican City.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which is
o-o
inside
o-o
Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Even I've
o-o
heard about
o-o
the porn painted
o-o
on the ceiling
o-o
of a chapel
o-o
in Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the
o-o
Sistine Chapel
o-o
painted by
o-o
Michelangelo.
sentence-next
o-o
A second
o-o
artist
o-o
covered the
o-o
private parts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Those church taxes,
o-o
especially
o-o
indulgences,
o-o
were so corrupt
o-o
and oppressive
o-o
that Martin Luther
o-o
and others
o-o
created the
o-o
Protestant
o-o
revolution,
o-o
which led to
o-o
creating
o-o
new religions,
o-o
including
o-o
the Church
o-o
of England.
o-o
The Pilgrims who
o-o
settled the
o-o
Plymouth
o-o
Plantation
o-o
were escaping
o-o
from those
o-o
oppressive
o-o
church
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do fewer
o-o
rich people
o-o
really hold back
o-o
on indulgences
o-o
for wine,
o-o
potato chips,
o-o
and foot
o-o
massages?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not those kinds
o-o
of indulgences.
sentence-next
o-o
These were
o-o
documents
o-o
of forgiveness
o-o
purchased from
o-o
the church.
sentence-next
o-o
The point is
o-o
money flowing
o-o
into Rome
o-o
from Catholic
o-o
churches
o-o
dried up
o-o
because the popes
o-o
got way
o-o
too greedy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back then
o-o
freedom of
o-o
religion
o-o
was about money,
o-o
not just beliefs.
sentence-next
o-o
And beliefs
o-o
and money
o-o
intertwined,
o-o
such as the ban
o-o
on abortions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the link
o-o
between money
o-o
and abortions?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Less abortions
o-o
yielded bigger
o-o
congregations
o-o
paying more
o-o
donations,
o-o
and buying off
o-o
more sins.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the
o-o
Protestant
o-o
religions
o-o
ended
o-o
the Italian
o-o
Renaissance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not quite right.
sentence-next
o-o
The economic
o-o
reforms that
o-o
created the
o-o
efficiency
o-o
of the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance
o-o
have spread
o-o
that basis
o-o
for wealth
o-o
around the world.
sentence-next
o-o
In the meantime
o-o
Italy is still
o-o
unwinding
o-o
other kinds of
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
The same slow
o-o
progress is
o-o
happening
o-o
in Greece
o-o
and Spain,
o-o
and Portugal,
o-o
and elsewhere.
sentence-next
o-o
Those
o-o
economies
o-o
are still weak
o-o
compared to
o-o
Germany,
o-o
France, and
o-o
Britain
o-o
where there
o-o
is less
o-o
of some kinds of
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Organized
o-o
crime is
o-o
still strong
o-o
in those
o-o
economically
o-o
weaker
o-o
nations.
sentence-next
o-o
But name-econhist-nickname
o-o
can't say that part
o-o
out loud
o-o
because he could
o-o
lose more than just
o-o
tenure.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Most importantly
o-o
the
o-o
economic
o-o
success
o-o
in
o-o
America
o-o
exposed
o-o
Europe's
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And revealed
o-o
that democracy
o-o
has less
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
I'm seeing
o-o
the pattern.
sentence-next
o-o
Higher levels
o-o
of democracy
o-o
yield less
o-o
corruption,
o-o
which causes
o-o
less waste,
o-o
which increases
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which increases
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which yields
o-o
much better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
sentence-next
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You've got it!
sentence-next
o-o
One last bit
o-o
here is that
o-o
America
o-o
was far away
o-o
from big
o-o
armies
o-o
and navies.
sentence-next
o-o
That allowed
o-o
democracy
o-o
a place to grow.
sentence-next
o-o
That success
o-o
created
o-o
jealousy in
o-o
Europeans.
sentence-next
o-o
Eventually
o-o
they formed the
o-o
European
o-o
Union
o-o
after most
o-o
Catholics and
o-o
Protestants
o-o
stopped fighting
o-o
one another,
o-o
except in
o-o
northern
o-o
Ireland.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And they stopped
o-o
having food fights
o-o
about table
o-o
etiquette.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the French,
o-o
Italians,
o-o
and Germans
o-o
stopped
o-o
fighting over
o-o
language
o-o
supremecy
o-o
when they saw
o-o
the inferior
o-o
English
o-o
language was
o-o
winning that
o-o
fight.
sentence-next
o-o
So basically
o-o
they're copying
o-o
the clear
o-o
success of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
that works so well
o-o
in the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute.
sentence-next
o-o
You said warfare
o-o
undermines the
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet political hawks,
o-o
who are mostly
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
promote warfare
o-o
as a way to
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
sentence-next
o-o
And competition
o-o
between
o-o
nations,
o-o
and between
o-o
businesses,
o-o
is the basis
o-o
of prosperity
o-o
in a free market,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm lost.
sentence-next
o-o
I feel like I'm
o-o
in a maze and
o-o
someone turned off
o-o
the lights.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Competition
o-o
between
o-o
businesses
o-o
provides
o-o
motivation
o-o
to work hard.
sentence-next
o-o
But what gets
o-o
overlooked is
o-o
the teamwork
o-o
among
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
That cooperation
o-o
yields
o-o
efficiency.
sentence-next
o-o
The same kind of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
happens among
o-o
citizens
o-o
within the same
o-o
nation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hmm.
sentence-next
o-o
So teamwork
o-o
is more than
o-o
touchy hyphen-here feely
o-o
games?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, employees
o-o
getting along,
o-o
who wouldn't
o-o
normally get along.
sentence-next
o-o
Like employees
o-o
ignoring
o-o
racial differences,
o-o
religious
o-o
differences,
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, and Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
ignoring their
o-o
differences
o-o
while at work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see!
sentence-next
o-o
When these
o-o
conflicts
o-o
are ignored,
o-o
that's cooperation.
sentence-next
o-o
And that increases
o-o
efficiency
o-o
begin-italics within end-italics
o-o
the business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So cooperation
o-o
within a business
o-o
makes the business
o-o
strong,
o-o
so it can better
o-o
compete against
o-o
other
o-o
businesses?
sentence-next
o-o
The lights are
o-o
coming back on.
sentence-next
o-o
I think I see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So fighting
o-o
between groups
o-o
of people
o-o
inspires,
o-o
motivates,
o-o
cooperation
o-o
within each
o-o
group?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not a bad
o-o
simplification.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And a lack
o-o
of cooperation
o-o
is why
o-o
climate change
o-o
is turning
o-o
our planet
o-o
into toast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In the past,
o-o
higher levels
o-o
of cooperation
o-o
came from
o-o
churches and
o-o
religions.
sentence-next
o-o
They originated
o-o
public schools,
o-o
hospitals,
o-o
food for the poor,
o-o
orphanages,
o-o
and
o-o
uplifting
o-o
songs.
sentence-next
o-o
But
o-o
climate change
o-o
is a topic
o-o
that's too hot
o-o
for churches
o-o
to touch.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Religions
o-o
can be good?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Ancient priests
o-o
in Egypt earned
o-o
their grain and beer
o-o
by predicting
o-o
eclipses
o-o
so their boss,
o-o
the pharaoh,
o-o
could pretend
o-o
to be powerful.
sentence-next
o-o
And they
o-o
predicted
o-o
when the Nile
o-o
River would
o-o
flood and recede.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus each year
o-o
priests used
o-o
mathematics
o-o
and surveying
o-o
to lay out
o-o
that year's
o-o
farming
o-o
boundaries.
sentence-next
o-o
All of that was
o-o
like magic
o-o
to people who
o-o
didn't understand
o-o
astronomy,
o-o
weather,
o-o
geometry,
o-o
and fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Galileo
o-o
was a threat to the
o-o
Catholic Church.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Because
o-o
he made
o-o
ditsy
o-o
people
o-o
dizzy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He showed that
o-o
science
o-o
was better than
o-o
priests
o-o
at those
o-o
brainy
o-o
skills.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed,
o-o
during the
o-o
European
o-o
black death,
o-o
priests lost their
o-o
credibility
o-o
by failing to
o-o
cure the sick with
o-o
holy water,
o-o
they lost their lives
o-o
by praying
o-o
at the bedside
o-o
of the dying,
o-o
and they lost their
o-o
congregations
o-o
when pilgrims
o-o
caught the
o-o
disease on
o-o
pilgrimages
o-o
to visit
o-o
the tomb of
o-o
Saint Augustine
o-o
of Hippo.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those priests
o-o
would have flunked
o-o
out of
o-o
