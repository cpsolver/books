Why are those

stupid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people

Ah,

I see.

o-o
The members of

a change if it's

likely to get

o-o
Otherwise it

unlikely as

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another barrier!
sentence-next
o-o
Political

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Far fairer is
o-o
to look at the

ballots again
o-o
to identify
o-o
the most popular

of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
would fill that

party's
o-o
statewide seat.
sentence-next
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That sounds like
o-o
it would
o-o
pressure hyphen-here wash away
o-o
party insiders.
sentence-next
o-o
And empower

voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much much

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With no

begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
elections

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means

no more blocking.
sentence-next
o-o
Right?
sentence-next
o-o
Like how

Hillary

That's right.
end-lyric

name-desha
o-o
you're bright.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's just counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And that's what the
o-o
important parts of

mathematics
o-o
are mostly about,
o-o
counting.
sentence-next
o-o
Speaking of which,
o-o
you're likely

to run into
o-o
people who
o-o
criticize
o-o
ranked choice

ballots because
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand
o-o
an important

counting detail.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What detail?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They will claim
o-o
you can't mark
o-o
two candidates
o-o
at the same rank.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like marking
o-o
both Oscar

and Pinoke
o-o
as a third choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
That's not
o-o
a problem for
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
But in
o-o
Australia
o-o
they've been using
o-o
paper ballots
o-o
and instant runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
for many decades.
sentence-next
o-o
Long before
o-o
computer
o-o
technology
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
were an option.
sentence-next
o-o
Their ballots
o-o
have a box
o-o
next to each
o-o
candidate's
o-o
name,
o-o
and a voter
o-o
writes a number
o-o
in each box.
sentence-next
o-o
Counting those
o-o
by hand
o-o
on election night
o-o
was a lot of work.
sentence-next
o-o
So they created
o-o
a shortcut.
sentence-next
o-o
They called that
o-o
ranking pattern
o-o
an begin-italics overvote end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
When
o-o
counting
o-o
reached
o-o
an overvote,
o-o
they tossed
o-o
that ballot
o-o
onto an
o-o
overvote pile,
o-o
and ignored it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's what I'd
o-o
probably do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
it's not like
o-o
the ballot
o-o
could be ripped
o-o
in half
o-o
to divide it
o-o
between two
o-o
candidates
o-o
ranked in
o-o
the same choice
o-o
column.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Actually,
o-o
mathematically,
o-o
fractions

would work.
sentence-next
o-o
But voters don't like
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Imagine
o-o
that!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So if you two
o-o
both marked

your ballots
o-o
with Oscar
o-o
and Pinoke
o-o
as your third choice,
o-o
and your higher hyphen-here ranked
o-o
candidates
o-o
were no longer
o-o
in the race,
o-o
how could you

count those

marks correctly?
sentence-next
o-o
Assuming there's
o-o
an even worse
o-o
candidate
o-o
ranked lower.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like Gollum,
o-o
or Voldemort,
o-o
or a real estate

developer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If the election
o-o
was smaller,

o-o
and the candidates
o-o
were standing
o-o
along one side
o-o
of a

football field,
o-o

o-o
and if we voted
o-o
by standing
o-o
in line
o-o
behind
o-o
the candidate
o-o
we support,
o-o
...
o-o
I'd tell name-desha
o-o
to stand in
o-o
Pinoke's line,
o-o
while I stand in
o-o
Oscar's line.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I'd tell
o-o
name-damien
o-o
to stand in
o-o
Pinoke's line.
sentence-next
o-o
I'd rather
o-o
deal with Oscar's
o-o
stenchiness
o-o
than get pricked
o-o
by Pinoke's
o-o
ginormous
o-o
proboscis.
sentence-next
o-o
Either way,
o-o
mathematically
o-o
that's
o-o
equivalent
o-o
to flipping
o-o
off the awful
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's the right
o-o
concept,
o-o
and it's fair,
o-o
but a textbook
o-o
would never use
o-o
your

terminology.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see
o-o
why this could be
o-o
useful.
sentence-next
o-o
When there are
o-o
lots of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from lots
o-o
of parties,
o-o
I'd want to mark
o-o
the most evil
o-o
candidate
o-o
as my last choice.
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
I need to use
o-o
the next hyphen-here to hyphen-here last
o-o
choice column
o-o
for all the
o-o
candidates
o-o
who are worse
o-o
than my first few

choices.
sentence-next
o-o
But who aren't
o-o
as evil
o-o
as the
o-o
diabolical
o-o
jerk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Great thinking!
o-o
That would handle
o-o
lots of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from multiple
o-o
parties,
o-o
without asking
o-o
a voter
o-o
to use each
o-o
choice column
o-o
only once.
sentence-next
Another
o-o
ballot
o-o
refinement
o-o
will be to add
o-o
a separate
o-o
ballot question
o-o
for ranking
o-o
political parties.
sentence-next
o-o
That would allow
o-o
calculating
o-o
the popularity
o-o
of the

parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting for parties?
sentence-next
o-o
Is that really
o-o
a thing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's what lots of
o-o
people in lots

of nations do
o-o
on their ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Although not yet

using ranked
o-o
choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Measuring
o-o
party
o-o
popularity
o-o
with better
o-o
ballots
o-o
will give us a
o-o
way to limit
o-o
the number of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from each party.
sentence-next
o-o
In a way
o-o
that's fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the
o-o
ballot doesn't
o-o
become my worst
o-o
nightmare?
sentence-next
o-o
With endless
o-o
ovals,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
sentence-next
o-o
Having six or
o-o
seven
o-o
choice columns
o-o
is much better than
o-o
twelve.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This means
o-o
very unpopular

parties get

excluded,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That makes sense
o-o
to me.

Can big

third parties
o-o
get at least one
o-o
candidate
o-o
each?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
That allows a
o-o
third party

a big party.
sentence-next
o-o
That's how

elections

I don't like names,

complex.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there a name
o-o
for all of

this mess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It is
o-o
sort of like

a jigsaw puzzle
o-o
with lots of

And different

Yet the method

FairVote?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
VoteFair
o-o
is an

election

o-o
FairVote is an

organization

two different

instant runoff
o-o
voting and
o-o
something called

the single

o-o
But they use

the name
o-o
begin-italics ranked choice

to cover
o-o
both methods.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's

overwhelmingly

confusing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next

The picky

this stuff.
sentence-next
o-o
Except to some

sentence-next
o-o
Mathematically
o-o
what makes more sense

o-o
that uses

Transfer
o-o
something.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've already

two or more

o-o
All you need
o-o
to remember,
o-o
besides ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting,
o-o
is two seats per
o-o
district,
o-o
and a few
o-o
statewide seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the

representation
o-o
part,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've got it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't pairwise

o-o
too complex
o-o
for math hyphen-here phobic

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Eliminating

when they occur,

voting
o-o
otherwise,
