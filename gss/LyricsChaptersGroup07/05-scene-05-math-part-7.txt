Why are those
o-o
voters so
o-o
stupid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people
o-o
in power
o-o
are the ones who
o-o
have to approve
o-o
any change.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
The members of
o-o
parliament
o-o
only embrace
o-o
a change if it's
o-o
likely to get
o-o
themselves
o-o
re hyphen-here elected.
sentence-next
o-o
Otherwise it
o-o
would be as
o-o
unlikely as
o-o
turkeys voting
o-o
in favor of
o-o
Thanksgiving.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another barrier!
sentence-next
o-o
Political
o-o
turkeys.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Far fairer is
o-o
to look at the
o-o
ballots again.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we
o-o
identify the
o-o
most popular
o-o
of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
will fill that
o-o
party's
o-o
statewide seat.
sentence-next
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each
o-o
statewide seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Which party
o-o
would win the
o-o
statewide seats?
sentence-next
o-o
Under current
o-o
conditions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Whichever
o-o
party,
o-o
or parties,
o-o
didn't get
o-o
their fair share
o-o
of district
o-o
seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That sounds like
o-o
it will
o-o
pressure hyphen-here wash away
o-o
the slime of
o-o
party insiders.
sentence-next
o-o
And make our
o-o
elections clean.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much much
o-o
fairer than what
o-o
we've got now.

To make
o-o
ballot marking
o-o
even easier,
o-o
future elections
o-o
can limit
o-o
the number of
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Would that involve
o-o
discrimination,
o-o
a glass ceiling,
o-o
or a glass slipper?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
We can add
o-o
a separate
o-o
ballot question
o-o
for ranking
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
That would allow
o-o
calculating
o-o
the popularity
o-o
of the
o-o
parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting for parties?
sentence-next
o-o
That seems strange.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's what lots of
o-o
people in lots
o-o
of nations do
o-o
on their ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Although not yet
o-o
using ranked
o-o
choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Measuring
o-o
party
o-o
popularity
o-o
with better
o-o
ballots
o-o
will give us a
o-o
way to limit
o-o
the number of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from each party.
sentence-next
o-o
In a way
o-o
that's fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
very unpopular
o-o
parties would get
o-o
excluded,
o-o
right?
sentence-next
o-o
So their
o-o
candidates
o-o
don't waste space
o-o
on the ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yet big
o-o
third parties
o-o
would get
o-o
at least one
o-o
candidate
o-o
each,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
That allows a
o-o
third party
o-o
to grow and
o-o
maybe overtake
o-o
a big party.
sentence-next
o-o
That's how
o-o
elections
o-o
used to work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
sentence-next
o-o
Competition!
sentence-next
o-o
I hope I live
o-o
to see the
o-o
Republican
o-o
and Democratic
o-o
parties
o-o
obliterated!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't like names,
o-o
but this is
o-o
getting
o-o
complex.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there a name
o-o
for all of
o-o
this mess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It is
o-o
sort of like
o-o
a jigsaw puzzle
o-o
with lots of
o-o
pieces.
sentence-next
o-o
And different
o-o
pieces
o-o
would work.
sentence-next
o-o
And they have lots
o-o
of names.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet the method
o-o
that reaches
o-o
farthest toward
o-o
what I've described
o-o
is called
o-o
VoteFair ranking.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
VoteFair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
I've heard about
o-o
FairVote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
VoteFair
o-o
is an
o-o
election
o-o
system I like.
sentence-next
o-o
FairVote is an
o-o
organization
o-o
that promotes
o-o
two different
o-o
counting
o-o
methods,
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting and
o-o
something called
o-o
the single
o-o
transferable
o-o
vote.
sentence-next
o-o
But they use
o-o
the name
o-o
begin-italics ranked choice
o-o
voting end-italics
o-o
to cover
o-o
both methods.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's
o-o
overwhelmingly
o-o
confusing.
