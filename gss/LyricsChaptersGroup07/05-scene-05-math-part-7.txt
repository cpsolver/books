In some
o-o
European
o-o
countries,
o-o
adjustments
o-o
are done to
o-o
ensure the
o-o
Pirate party
o-o
and other
o-o
non hyphen-here tiny
o-o
parties
o-o
get their fair share
o-o
of seats in
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It hides the
o-o
unfairness of
o-o
still using
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet lots of
o-o
people like it
o-o
because
o-o
it yields
o-o
what's called
o-o
begin-italics proportional
o-o
representation end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
So each voter
o-o
can point to
o-o
someone in
o-o
parliament
o-o
and claim their vote
o-o
helped elect
o-o
that MP,
o-o
er,
o-o
member of
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
From reading
o-o
news about
o-o
Europe those
o-o
governments
o-o
have as much
o-o
corruption
o-o
as us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
They focus on
o-o
the balance
o-o
of power
o-o
between parties.
sentence-next
o-o
But mostly
o-o
they allow
o-o
party insiders
o-o
to control which
o-o
politicians
o-o
win the seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's like hiring
o-o
a coyote
o-o
as the night guard
o-o
at a
o-o
chicken coop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So back here
o-o
in the United States,
o-o
suppose each district
o-o
had two
o-o
representatives
o-o
instead of one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would double
o-o
the size of
o-o
the house of
o-o
representatives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't that
o-o
be avoided
o-o
by making
o-o
each district
o-o
double the size?
sentence-next
o-o
And having half
o-o
as many districts?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Very good!
sentence-next
o-o
And using a fraction
o-o
no less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's like building
o-o
a staircase.
sentence-next
o-o
Half as many steps
o-o
means each step
o-o
is twice as high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're
o-o
stepping up
o-o
to design
o-o
a new Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course the
o-o
most popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
would win
o-o
the first seat.
sentence-next
o-o
In a
o-o
double hyphen-here sized
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So how's the
o-o
second seat filled?
sentence-next
o-o
In a way that's fair.
sentence-next
o-o
For the sheep,
o-o
and goats,
o-o
and pigs?
sentence-next
o-o
Or maybe I should say,
o-o
for women to get
o-o
the representation
o-o
we deserve.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Using simple math,
o-o
a computer can
o-o
calculate which
o-o
voters are 
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
by the first hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since that math
o-o
is simple,
o-o
I don't need to
o-o
hear about it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only to know
o-o
it involves
o-o
division.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sweet!
sentence-next
o-o
Divide and
o-o
conquer!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The ballots
o-o
of those
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
voters
o-o
would have their
o-o
influence
o-o
greatly reduced.
sentence-next
o-o
Often all the
o-o
way to zero.
sentence-next
o-o
The remaining
o-o
voters still have
o-o
full influence
o-o
for their ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
is done again,
o-o
and the most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
wins the
o-o
second seat.
sentence-next
o-o
In this
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm guessing
o-o
the tendency
o-o
would be
o-o
for each district
o-o
to elect one
o-o
Republican
o-o
and one
o-o
Democrat?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Under current
o-o
conditions,
o-o
usually yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Assuming both
o-o
parties offer
o-o
good candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh yeah,
o-o
there will be
o-o
a second
o-o
Republican
o-o
and a second
o-o
Democrat
o-o
in the race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Probably
o-o
three or four
o-o
candidates
o-o
from each party.
sentence-next
o-o
That prevents
o-o
party insiders
o-o
from limiting
o-o
your choices
o-o
to just the two
o-o
they want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Suppose the
o-o
Republican
o-o
party only
o-o
offers puppet
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
and the Democratic
o-o
party offers
o-o
anti hyphen-here corruption
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Barack
o-o
and Hypatia,
o-o
then both winners
o-o
could be Democrats?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This seems like a
o-o
winning
o-o
pole vault
o-o
over our low
o-o
limbo bar,
o-o
where we
o-o
are now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But if every district
o-o
elects one
o-o
Republican and
o-o
one Democrat,
o-o
then Congress
o-o
would be tied.
sentence-next
o-o
That's cockeyed.
sentence-next
o-o
The population
o-o
is not
o-o
evenly
o-o
divided
o-o
between the
o-o
two parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To fix that
o-o
unfair balance,
o-o
we make the
o-o
districts a little
o-o
bigger.
sentence-next
o-o
And we reserve
o-o
a few special
o-o
seats.
sentence-next
o-o
Those are called
o-o
statewide seats.
sentence-next
o-o
The party hyphen-here based
o-o
measurements
o-o
tell us which
o-o
party deserves
o-o
to win each
o-o
of those
o-o
statewide
o-o
seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And party
o-o
insiders
o-o
will choose
o-o
whose butts
o-o
will fill
o-o
those seats?
sentence-next
o-o
That seems
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Lots of
o-o
European
o-o
nations
o-o
do it that way.
sentence-next
o-o
But you're right.
sentence-next
o-o
It's not fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why are those
o-o
voters so
o-o
stupid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people
o-o
in power
o-o
are the ones who
o-o
have to approve
o-o
any change.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
The members of
o-o
parliament
o-o
only embrace
o-o
a change if it's
o-o
likely to get
o-o
themselves
o-o
re hyphen-here elected.
sentence-next
o-o
Otherwise it
o-o
would be as
o-o
unlikely as
o-o
turkeys voting
o-o
in favor of
o-o
Thanksgiving.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another barrier!
sentence-next
o-o
Political
o-o
turkeys.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Far fairer is
o-o
to look at the
o-o
ballots again.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we
o-o
identify the
o-o
most popular
o-o
of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
will fill that
o-o
party's
o-o
statewide seat.
sentence-next
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each
o-o
statewide seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Which party
o-o
would win the
o-o
statewide seats?
sentence-next
o-o
Under current
o-o
conditions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Whichever
o-o
party,
o-o
or parties,
o-o
didn't get
o-o
their fair share
o-o
of district
o-o
seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That sounds like
o-o
it will
o-o
pressure hyphen-here wash away
o-o
the slime of
o-o
party insiders.
sentence-next
o-o
And make our
o-o
elections clean.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much much
o-o
fairer than what
o-o
we've got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To make
o-o
ballot marking
o-o
even easier,
o-o
future elections
o-o
can limit
o-o
the number of
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Would that involve
o-o
discrimination,
o-o
a glass ceiling,
o-o
or a glass slipper?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
We can add
o-o
a separate
o-o
ballot question
o-o
for ranking
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
That would allow
o-o
calculating
o-o
the popularity
o-o
of the
o-o
parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting for parties?
sentence-next
o-o
That seems strange.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's what lots of
o-o
people in lots
o-o
of nations do
o-o
on their ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Although not yet
o-o
using ranked
o-o
choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Measuring
o-o
party
o-o
popularity
o-o
with better
o-o
ballots
o-o
will give us a
o-o
way to limit
o-o
the number of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from each party.
sentence-next
o-o
In a way
o-o
that's fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
very unpopular
o-o
parties would get
o-o
excluded,
o-o
right?
sentence-next
o-o
So their
o-o
candidates
o-o
don't waste space
o-o
on the ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yet big
o-o
third parties
o-o
would get
o-o
at least one
o-o
candidate
o-o
each,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
That allows a

third party
o-o
to grow and

maybe overtake
o-o
a big party.
sentence-next
o-o
That's how
o-o
elections
o-o
used to work.
end-lyric

I love it!

Competition!

I hope I live

obliterated!
end-lyric

I don't like names,

getting

complex.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there a name
o-o
for all of

this mess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It is
o-o
sort of like

a jigsaw puzzle
o-o
with lots of

pieces.

o-o
And different
o-o
pieces
o-o
would work.
sentence-next

And they have lots

Yet the method

farthest toward

what I've described

is called
o-o
VoteFair ranking.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
VoteFair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
I've heard about
o-o
FairVote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
VoteFair
o-o
is an

election
o-o
system I like.
sentence-next
o-o
FairVote is an

organization
o-o
that promotes
o-o
two different

o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting and
o-o
something called
o-o
the single

vote.
sentence-next
o-o
But they use

the name
o-o
begin-italics ranked choice

both methods.
