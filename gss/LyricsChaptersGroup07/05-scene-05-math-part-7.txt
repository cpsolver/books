There's another
o-o
smaller
o-o
barrier.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of money
o-o
is given to
o-o
people who
o-o
criticize
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's there
o-o
to criticize?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What are you not
o-o
telling us?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's easy to
o-o
criticize
o-o
flawed
o-o
ways to count
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
The critic
o-o
can point out
o-o
the failures
o-o
in Alaska
o-o
and Burlington
o-o
without
o-o
mentioning
o-o
those failures
o-o
would not have
o-o
happened
o-o
if the pairwise
o-o
losing
o-o
candidate
o-o
in the top three
o-o
had been
o-o
eliminated.
sentence-next
o-o
It's easy to
o-o
criticize
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
as difficult
o-o
to mark if
o-o
the election
o-o
uses software
o-o
that dismisses
o-o
ballots with
o-o
more than one mark
o-o
in each
o-o
choice column.
sentence-next
o-o
And some critics
o-o
claim that
o-o
score ballots
o-o
are better than
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are score ballots
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Score ballots
o-o
have ratings
o-o
instead of
o-o
rankings.
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
a voter can
o-o
leave some
o-o
columns empty
o-o
to express
o-o
a strong
o-o
preference.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as
o-o
Jewish friends
o-o
expressing they
o-o
really begin-italics really end-italics
o-o
do not want
o-o
pork
o-o
as a topping
o-o
on a shared
o-o
pizza.
sentence-next
o-o
That's useful
o-o
among friends.
sentence-next
o-o
But a score ballot
o-o
in a general
o-o
election
o-o
for governor,
o-o
president,
o-o
or mayor
o-o
would be vulnerable
o-o
to voters who
o-o
exaggerate.
sentence-next
o-o
Similar to
o-o
the clapping
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
there's no way
o-o
to know which
o-o
ballots are from
o-o
voters with
o-o
deep religious
o-o
beliefs,
o-o
and which ballots
o-o
are from
o-o
drama queens.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm seeing that
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots are
o-o
great,
o-o
but the counting
o-o
details matter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here's a way
o-o
to see why.
sentence-next
o-o
These colored blocks
o-o
represent
o-o
ten ranked
o-o
choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
The colors
o-o
represent
o-o
four
o-o
ice cream
o-o
flavors.
sentence-next
o-o
The winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla.
sentence-next
o-o
Depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.

As usual,

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
plurality voting,
o-o
what we use now,
o-o
just looks down
o-o
on the blocks
o-o
from the top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Instant runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
also looks down
o-o
from the top,
o-o
although on some
o-o
ballots
o-o
it looks
o-o
deeper.
sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
looks at the
o-o
side view.
sentence-next
o-o
So it sees
o-o
every preference
o-o
detail.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
All this makes sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Now we know
o-o
how to defeat
o-o
vote splitting!
sentence-next
o-o
That's the
o-o
vulnerability
o-o
that big
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
exploit.
sentence-next
o-o
So we're done,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now math
o-o
is feeling like

a boa constrictor

wrapping around

o-o
with a full

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a
o-o
foolish tactic
o-o
against a
o-o
boa constrictor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're fighting
o-o
against fear.
sentence-next
o-o
This will be
o-o
easier,
o-o
mathwise.
sentence-next
o-o
So far we have
o-o
been talking
o-o
about how to
o-o
choose a
o-o
mayor,
o-o
governor,
o-o
or president
o-o
with fairness.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the first half.
sentence-next
o-o
But what happens
o-o
when there are
o-o
lots of seats
o-o
to fill,
o-o
like in
o-o
Congress?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain overload!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh right.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead, try this.
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine a
o-o
group of friends
o-o
eating together
o-o
and choosing
o-o
toppings for
o-o
two pizzas.
sentence-next
o-o
If the majority
o-o
want the
o-o
first pizza's
o-o
topping to be
o-o
pork sausage,
o-o
but a third of
o-o
the friends are
o-o
Jewish,
o-o
how should the
o-o
topping
o-o
for the second
o-o
pizza
o-o
be chosen?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In the non hyphen-here math
o-o
verse,

they would start

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm guessing
o-o
the second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate,
o-o
er, topping,
o-o
should be elected,
o-o
er,
o-o
selected
o-o
for the second
o-o
pizza.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular
o-o
has more than one
o-o
meaning.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's try
o-o
yet another
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
five wolves and
o-o
four sheep vote
o-o
on what to eat
o-o
for dinner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ha! The five wolves
o-o
would eat the
o-o
four sheep!
sentence-next
o-o
And claim it's fair
o-o
because it's
o-o
democracy!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So us
o-o
minorities,
o-o
like the sheep,
o-o
need a way to
o-o
fight against a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Bill of Rights
o-o
is nice,
o-o
but that's
o-o
not enough
o-o
to protect us
o-o
minorities
o-o
from white

supremacists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
As you see,
o-o
just getting a
o-o
majority
o-o
is just part of
o-o
the big picture.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought you were
o-o
showing us
o-o
everything on
o-o
a twelve hyphen-here foot
o-o
TV screen.
sentence-next
o-o
Where on the screen
o-o
should we
o-o
be looking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see something.
sentence-next
o-o
If districts
o-o
were filled with
o-o
wolves and sheep,
o-o
and each district
o-o
had slightly more
o-o
wolves than sheep,
o-o
then every
o-o
district would
o-o
elect a wolf.
sentence-next
o-o
Then Congress would
o-o
be nothing but wolves.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's not far from
o-o
what are now
o-o
mostly
o-o
white males.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In Europe,
o-o
instead of just
o-o
wolves and sheep,
o-o
they have a
o-o
handful of
o-o
political parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like wolves and sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sure.
sentence-next
o-o
On the ballot
o-o
each voter marks their
o-o
favorite
o-o
political party.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's say
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
mark their
o-o
ballot for
o-o
the Pirate
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I would join that one.
sentence-next
o-o
It sounds like
o-o
they are against
o-o
puppets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do they slash
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
with their
o-o
swords?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They don't carry
o-o
swords,
o-o
or dress like
o-o
pirates.
sentence-next
o-o
But they do
o-o
oppose
o-o
what they think is
o-o
unfairness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Go pirates!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In some
o-o
European
o-o
countries,
o-o
adjustments
o-o
are done to
o-o
ensure the

Pirate party
o-o
and other
o-o
non hyphen-here tiny
o-o
parties
o-o
get their fair share
o-o
of seats in
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It hides the
o-o
unfairness of
o-o
still using
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet lots of
o-o
people like it
o-o
because
o-o
it yields
o-o
what's called
o-o
begin-italics proportional
o-o
representation end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
the percentage
o-o
of seats
o-o
going to each
o-o
political party
o-o
roughly matches
o-o
the percentage
o-o
of voters
o-o
who mark
o-o
each party
o-o
as their favorite.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
From reading
o-o
news about
o-o
Europe those
o-o
governments
o-o
have as much
o-o
corruption
o-o
as us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
They focus on
o-o
the balance
o-o
of power
o-o
between parties.
sentence-next
o-o
But mostly
o-o
they allow
o-o
party insiders
o-o
to control which
o-o
politicians
o-o
win the seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's like hiring
o-o
a coyote
o-o
as the night guard
o-o
at a
o-o
chicken coop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So back here
o-o
in the United States,
o-o
suppose each district
o-o
had two
o-o
representatives
o-o
instead of one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would double
o-o
the size of
o-o
the house of
o-o
representatives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't that
o-o
be avoided
o-o
by making
o-o
each district
o-o
double the size?
sentence-next
o-o
And having half
o-o
as many districts?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Very good!
sentence-next
o-o
And using a fraction
o-o
no less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's like building
o-o
a staircase.
sentence-next
o-o
Half as many steps
o-o
means each step

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow.

o-o
Now you're

stepping up
o-o
to design

a new Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course the

most popular
