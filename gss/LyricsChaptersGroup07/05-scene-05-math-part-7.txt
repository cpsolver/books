Why are those
o-o
voters so
o-o
stupid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people
o-o
in power
o-o
are the ones who
o-o
have to approve
o-o
any change.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
The members of
o-o
parliament
o-o
only embrace
o-o
a change if it's
o-o
likely to get
o-o
themselves
o-o
re hyphen-here elected.
sentence-next
o-o
Otherwise it
o-o
would be as
o-o
unlikely as
o-o
turkeys voting
o-o
in favor of
o-o
Thanksgiving.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another barrier!
sentence-next
o-o
Political
o-o
turkeys.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Far fairer is
o-o
to look at the
o-o
ballots again
o-o
to identify
o-o
the most popular
o-o
of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
would fill that
o-o
party's
o-o
extra seat.
sentence-next
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each next seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That sounds like
o-o
it would rip
o-o
control away from
o-o
party insiders.
sentence-next
o-o
And empower
o-o
the voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much much
o-o
fairer than what
o-o
we've got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With no
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
elections
o-o
would no
o-o
longer be
o-o
limited
o-o
to just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
per party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
no more blocking,
o-o
like how
o-o
Hillary
o-o
Clinton
o-o
got blocked
o-o
in two thousand eight.
sentence-next
o-o
Right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha
o-o
you're bright.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's just counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And that's what the
o-o
important parts of
o-o
mathematics
o-o
are mostly about,
o-o
counting.
sentence-next
o-o
Speaking of which,
o-o
you're likely
o-o
to run into
o-o
people who
o-o
criticize
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots because
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand
o-o
an important
o-o
counting detail.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What detail?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They will claim
o-o
you can't mark
o-o
two candidates
o-o
at the same rank.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like marking
o-o
both Oscar
o-o
and Pinoke
o-o
as a third choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
That's not
o-o
a problem for
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
But in
o-o
Australia
o-o
they've been using
o-o
paper ballots
o-o
for ranked choice
o-o
voting
o-o
for many decades,
o-o
long before
o-o
computer
o-o
technology
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
were an option.
sentence-next
o-o
Their ballots
o-o
have a box
o-o
next to each
o-o
candidate's
o-o
name,
o-o
and a voter
o-o
writes a number
o-o
in each box.
sentence-next
o-o
Counting those
o-o
by hand
o-o
on election night
o-o
was a lot of work,
o-o
so they created
o-o
a shortcut.
sentence-next
o-o
They called that
o-o
ranking pattern
o-o
an begin-italics overvote end-italics no-space ,
o-o
and when
o-o
the counting
o-o
reached
o-o
an overvote
o-o
they tossed
o-o
that ballot
o-o
onto an
o-o
overvote pile,
o-o
and ignored it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's what I'd
o-o
probably do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
it's not like
o-o
the ballot
o-o
could be ripped
o-o
in half
o-o
to divide it
o-o
between two
o-o
candidates
o-o
ranked in
o-o
the same choice
o-o
column.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Actually,
o-o
mathematically,
o-o
fractions
o-o
would work.
sentence-next
o-o
But voters don't like
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Imagine
o-o
that!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So if you two
o-o
both marked
o-o
your ballots
o-o
with Oscar
o-o
and Pinoke
o-o
as your third choice,
o-o
and your higher hyphen-here ranked
o-o
candidates
o-o
were no longer
o-o
in the race,
o-o
how could you
o-o
count those
o-o
marks correctly?
sentence-next
o-o
Assuming there's
o-o
an even worse
o-o
candidate
o-o
ranked lower.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like Gollum,
o-o
or Voldemort,
o-o
or a real estate
o-o
developer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If voting
o-o
were done
o-o
in person,
o-o
by standing
o-o
in lines
o-o
behind the
o-o
candidates,
o-o
I'd tell name-desha
o-o
to stand in
o-o
Pinoke's line,
o-o
while I stand in
o-o
Oscar's line.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I'd tell
o-o
name-damien
o-o
to stand in
o-o
Pinoke's line,
o-o
cause I'd rather
o-o
deal with Oscar's
o-o
stenchiness
o-o
than get pricked
o-o
by Pinoke's
o-o
ginormous
o-o
proboscis.
sentence-next
o-o
Either way,
o-o
mathematically
o-o
that's
o-o
equivalent
o-o
to flipping
o-o
off the awful
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's the right
o-o
concept,
o-o
and it's fair,
o-o
but a textbook
o-o
would never use
o-o
your
o-o
terminology.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see
o-o
why this could be
o-o
useful.
sentence-next
o-o
When there are
o-o
lots of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from lots
o-o
of parties,
o-o
I'd want to mark
o-o
the most evil
o-o
candidate
o-o
as my last choice.
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
I need to use
o-o
the next hyphen-here to hyphen-here last
o-o
choice column
o-o
for all the
o-o
candidates
o-o
who are worse
o-o
than my first few
o-o
choices,
o-o
but not as evil
o-o
as the
o-o
diabolical
o-o
jerk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Great thinking!
o-o
That would handle
o-o
lots of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from multiple
o-o
parties,
o-o
without asking
o-o
a voter
o-o
to use each
o-o
choice column
o-o
only once.
sentence-next
Another
o-o
ballot
o-o
refinement
o-o
will be to add
o-o
a separate
o-o
ballot question
o-o
for ranking
o-o
political parties.
sentence-next
o-o
That would allow
o-o
calculating
o-o
the popularity
o-o
of the
o-o
parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting for parties?
sentence-next
o-o
Is that really
o-o
a thing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's what lots of
o-o
people in lots
o-o
of nations do
o-o
on their ballots,
o-o
although not yet
o-o
using ranked
o-o
choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Measuring
o-o
party
o-o
popularity
o-o
results
o-o
gives us a
o-o
fair way
o-o
to limit
o-o
the number of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from each party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the least popular
o-o
parties
o-o
can get
o-o
excluded?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That makes sense to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the biggest
o-o
third parties
o-o
would get
o-o
one candidate
o-o
each, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That gives small
o-o
parties an
o-o
opportunity
o-o
to grow.
sentence-next
o-o
And even to
o-o
overtake
o-o
big parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't like names,
o-o
but this is
o-o
getting
o-o
complex.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there a name
o-o
for all of
o-o
this mess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It is sort of like
o-o
a jigsaw puzzle
o-o
with lots of pieces,
o-o
and different
o-o
pieces would work,

and they have lots

of names.

The method

FairVote?
end-lyric

VoteFair
o-o
is an

organization
o-o
that promotes

what they call

but they use
o-o
that name
o-o
with a very
o-o
limited
o-o
meaning
o-o
that confusingly
o-o
covers
o-o
two counting
o-o
methods.
sentence-next
o-o
The broader
o-o
meaning of
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
voting is
o-o
any counting
o-o
method
o-o
that uses
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's
o-o
overwhelmingly

confusing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
The picky

terminology
o-o

this stuff,

even in

college courses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
OK, you like

VoteFair something.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there a

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the most

important part.
sentence-next
o-o
Because pairwise counts
o-o
reveal not just support

but opposition.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's

ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
that you

recommend?
