Yeah,
o-o
it's not like

the ballot

So if you two

your ballots

with Oscar
o-o
and Pinoke
o-o
as your third choice,
o-o
and your higher hyphen-here ranked

how could you

Assuming there's

an even worse

If the election

and the candidates

were standing

the candidate

...
o-o
I would tell name-desha

while I stand in

Oscar's line.

And I would tell

o-o
I would rather

o-o
Either way,
o-o
mathematically
o-o
that's

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's the right

However

Beneath all the

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Great thinking!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes,

this way,

This is

You start
o-o
by marking
o-o
your very favorite

sentence-next
o-o
Then you plan where to

mark your

candidates,
o-o
which might mean
o-o
not marking them

at all.

o-o
Then,
o-o
if the
o-o
instructions
o-o
don't tell you
o-o
to mark only
o-o
one oval
o-o
in each column,
o-o
you look for ways
o-o
to group
o-o
candidates
o-o
at the same rank.
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
you like them

about the same.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What if the

Then at least

include marks

for one or two

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can handle that.

Except maybe

in the

In fact,

But whoever gets the

No,

not always.

o-o
Yet that threshold

Because

vote splitting

all the other

o-o
They wanted

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn

Another simple

approval

sentence-next
o-o
In each party,

the two candidates
