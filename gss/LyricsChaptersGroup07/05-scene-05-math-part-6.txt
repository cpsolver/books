Yeah,
o-o
it's not like
o-o
the ballot
o-o
could be ripped
o-o
in half

to divide it

between two

candidates

ranked in

the same choice

column.

Actually,

mathematically,

Imagine

that!

So if you two

your ballots
o-o
with Oscar
o-o
and Pinoke
o-o
as your third choice,
o-o
and your higher hyphen-here ranked

candidates
o-o
were no longer
o-o
in the race,
o-o
how could you

count those

marks correctly?
sentence-next
o-o
Assuming there's

an even worse

candidate
o-o
ranked lower.

If the election

o-o
and the candidates

were standing

along one side

of a

and if we voted

by standing

in line

behind

the candidate

we support,

...
o-o
I'd tell name-desha

to stand in
o-o
Pinoke's line,
o-o
while I stand in
o-o
Oscar's line.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I'd tell

name-damien

to stand in

Pinoke's line.
sentence-next
o-o
I'd rather

deal with Oscar's

by Pinoke's
o-o
ginormous
o-o
proboscis.
sentence-next
o-o
Either way,
o-o
mathematically
o-o
that's
o-o
equivalent
o-o
to flipping
o-o
off the awful
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's the right

concept,

and it's fair.

However

a textbook

I think I see

why this could be

If there was

Beneath all the

Ah yes.

This counting rule

Without

the number of

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Great thinking!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes,
o-o
this way,
o-o
seven

end-lyric

I'd have to do

some

head scratching
o-o
to figure out

how to mark

those ovals.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Typically
o-o
you would mark
o-o
your very favorite
o-o
two candidates
o-o
as your first

sentence-next
o-o
You'd plan where to
o-o
mark your
o-o
most hyphen-here disliked
o-o
candidates,
o-o
which might mean
o-o
not marking them
o-o
at all.
sentence-next
o-o
Then,
o-o
if the
o-o
instructions
o-o
don't tell you
o-o
to mark only
o-o
one oval
o-o
in each column,
o-o
you look for ways
o-o
to group
o-o
candidates
o-o
at the same rank.
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
you like them
o-o
about the same.
end-lyric

Fitting marks

into ovals

sounds easier

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yet doing it twice,
o-o
once in the

primary

o-o
might stress out

some voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fortunately
o-o
primary

In fact,

they can

continue

single hyphen-here choice

ballots.

Then the party

offers as a

second

nominee
o-o
whoever got

the second hyphen-here highest

vote count.
end-lyric

That's the

popular

right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The words
o-o
second hyphen-here most hyphen-here popular

meaning.
sentence-next

What matters

is that

using money

vote splitting
o-o
only works if the

candidates
o-o

in the

twenty twenty

election
o-o
all the other

o-o
were progressive.

o-o
They wanted

ballot.

Another simple

way to handle

is to use

approval

That ballot

just changes
o-o
the instructions
