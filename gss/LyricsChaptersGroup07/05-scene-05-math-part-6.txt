Yeah,

it's not like

the ballot

So if you two

how could you

Assuming there's

If the election

I'd tell name-desha

while I stand in

Oscar's line.

And I'd tell

I'd rather

o-o
Either way,

mathematically

That's the right

Typically
o-o
you would mark

your very favorite

sentence-next
o-o
You'd plan where to

mark your

which might mean

not marking them

Then,
o-o
if the

instructions

don't tell you

o-o
you look for ways

candidates

That means

you like them

Yet doing it twice,

The words

Another simple
