ambee sings-mathprof amenn

I can see,

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

Even better,

That sounds like

end-lyric

It's

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is there some

that you could

explain,
o-o
in a way that

makes that magic

understandable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But before that
o-o
will make sense
o-o
I should ask you
o-o
how many pairwise
o-o
counts are involved
o-o
in each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess two.
sentence-next
o-o
If the two
o-o
candidates are
o-o
named Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
there's the count
o-o
for how many voters,
o-o
well, support,
o-o
uh, Pinoke
o-o
over Oscar.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's
o-o
the other count,
o-o
of how many voters
o-o
prefer Oscar
o-o
over Pinoke.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And will those two
o-o
numbers always
o-o
add up to the
o-o
total number
o-o
of voters?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think so.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but what if
o-o
some voters rank
o-o
Pinoke and Oscar
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, that means
o-o
there will be
o-o
a third number.
sentence-next
o-o
The number
o-o
of voters
o-o
who rank them
o-o
the same.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes there are
o-o
three numbers
o-o
for each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
sentence-next
o-o
But when summarized,
o-o
the third count
o-o
can be omitted.
sentence-next
o-o
This means the
o-o
pairwise numbers
o-o
can be put into
o-o
a table, a square grid.
sentence-next
o-o
And each row
o-o
would be labeled
o-o
with the name
o-o
of a candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
And the columns
o-o
would be labeled
o-o
with the same
o-o
names in the same
o-o
sequence.
sentence-next
o-o
And each cell
o-o
would contain
o-o
one pairwise count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So if the
o-o
candidates
o-o
are named
o-o
Pinoke, Oscar,
o-o
Barack, and
o-o
Hypatia,
o-o
it would be
o-o
a four by four
o-o
grid, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're ready
o-o
to see the magic
o-o
of the counting
o-o
method I like
o-o
best.
sentence-next
o-o
It re hyphen-here arranges
o-o
the sequence of
o-o
candidates,
o-o
in the rows
o-o
and columns.
sentence-next
o-o
The goal is to
o-o
re hyphen-here arrange
o-o
the sequence
o-o
until the biggest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
upper hyphen-here right
o-o
triangular area
o-o
of the grid,
o-o
and the smallest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
other half,
o-o
the lower hyphen-here left
o-o
triangular area.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we look at
o-o
that sequence.
sentence-next
o-o
It indicates
o-o
not only who is
o-o
most popular,
o-o
but who is second
o-o
most popular,
o-o
who is third most
o-o
popular, and
o-o
so on down to
o-o
who is least
o-o
popular.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that method
o-o
called?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The Condorcet
o-o
Kemeny
o-o
method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That method
o-o
sounds more
o-o
convoluted
o-o
than building a
o-o
spiral staircase
o-o
down to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe that's the
o-o
kind of math
o-o
your landlord
o-o
uses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that the
o-o
fairest method?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's much better
o-o
than instant
o-o
runoff voting.
sentence-next
o-o
But the best
o-o
vote hyphen-here counting
o-o
system would be
o-o
even more complex.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So math
o-o
really is
o-o
the stairway
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do math

o-o
even have

all the

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's a

proof that proves
o-o
it's not possible
o-o

a voting method
o-o

sentence-next
o-o
So it's complicated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Sounds like life and

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There are some

sentence-next
o-o
Math geeks know which

can sometimes

sentence-next
o-o
But there has been

how begin-italics often end-italics
o-o
each method fails,

each one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why hasn't that

research
o-o
been done?

Some people claim

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
That's not

pairwise

sentence-next
o-o
But in
o-o
Australia
o-o
they call that
o-o
an begin-italics overvote end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Their ballots
o-o
have a box
o-o
next to each
o-o
candidate's
o-o
name,
o-o
and a voter
o-o
writes a number
o-o
in each box.
sentence-next
o-o
So an overvote
o-o
is when a voter
o-o
writes the
o-o
same number
o-o
more than once.
sentence-next
o-o
Counting those
o-o
ballots by hand
o-o
on election night
o-o
was a lot of work.
sentence-next
o-o
So when counting
o-o
reached an
o-o
overvote,
o-o
they tossed
o-o
that ballot
o-o
onto an

overvote pile,
o-o
and ignored it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's what I'd

probably do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
it's not like

the ballot

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Actually,
