If it were
o-o
sports teams,
o-o
then,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
well,
o-o
a team would be
o-o
the worst loser
o-o
if they lost all
o-o
their pairwise
o-o
matches.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
That's called
o-o
a pairwise
o-o
losing
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
Keep going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So that loser
o-o
would get
o-o
booted.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And then we would
o-o
look for the
o-o
next loser,
o-o
from the remaining
o-o
teams, er,
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And when there's
o-o
just one team,
o-o
or candidate,
o-o
remaining, that
o-o
would be the
o-o
winner, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
That pairwise
o-o
elimination
o-o
process would work.
sentence-next
o-o
Up to a point.
sentence-next
o-o
A simple shortcut
o-o
approach is to
o-o
look for the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who wins all
o-o
of their pairwise
o-o
contests.
sentence-next
o-o
The academic
o-o
world calls that a
o-o
Condorcet
begin-explain pronounced cone-dor-SAY end-explain
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Condorcet,
o-o
that sounds stuffy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's named after
o-o
a French guy
o-o
whose title was the
o-o
Marquis de
begin-explain pronounced mar-KEE day end-explain
o-o
Condorcet.
sentence-next
o-o
For a long time
o-o
Europeans
o-o
thought he was the

first person to
o-o
publish a
o-o
description
o-o
of that method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I can see,
o-o
as you say,
o-o
the concept
o-o
is the key.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet on a test,
o-o
students would be
o-o
asked to recall,
o-o
or recognize,
o-o
his name.
sentence-next
o-o
That's dumb.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see.
sentence-next
o-o
A Condorcet winner
o-o
would get more than
o-o
half the votes,
o-o
a majority,
o-o
without any
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this is the
o-o
best way to make
o-o
selections
o-o
in elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sometimes
o-o
there's no
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner.
sentence-next
o-o
Using the elimination
o-o
approach, it can
o-o
reach a point where
o-o
none of the candidates
o-o
loses all their
o-o
pairwise contests.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Partial losers.
sentence-next
o-o
But no total
o-o
losers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what?
sentence-next
o-o
Count how many
o-o
losses?
sentence-next
o-o
Or measure
o-o
how big the
o-o
losses are?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A plus
o-o
for thinking
o-o
of those
o-o
ideas!
sentence-next
o-o
Actually
o-o
there are many
o-o
ways to resolve
o-o
those cases.
sentence-next
o-o
Even better,
o-o
there are methods
o-o
that don't first
o-o
look for Condorcet
o-o
winners or losers.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead they use
o-o
the pairwise counts
o-o
in ways that
o-o
don't need to do
o-o
anything
o-o
special.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet they find the
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner when
o-o
one exists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's
o-o
beautiful
o-o
advanced
o-o
mathematics.
sentence-next
o-o
After all,
o-o
magic is a
o-o
word for what
o-o
we don't yet
o-o
fully
o-o
comprehend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like how
o-o
my landlord
o-o
calculates my
o-o
utility
o-o
bill.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is there some
o-o
method you like,
o-o
that you could
o-o
explain,
o-o
in a way that
o-o
makes that magic
o-o
understandable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But before that
o-o
will make sense
o-o
I should ask you
o-o
how many pairwise
o-o
counts are involved
o-o
in each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess two.
sentence-next
o-o
If the two
o-o
candidates are
o-o
named Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
there's the count
o-o
for how many voters,
o-o
well, support,
o-o
uh, Pinoke
o-o
over Oscar.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's
o-o
the other count,
o-o
of how many voters
o-o
prefer Oscar
o-o
over Pinoke.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And will those two
o-o
numbers always
o-o
add up to the
o-o
total number
o-o
of voters?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think so.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but what if
o-o
some voters rank
o-o
Pinoke and Oscar
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, that means
o-o
there will be
o-o
a third number.
sentence-next
o-o
The number
o-o
of voters
o-o
who rank them
o-o
the same.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes there are
o-o
three numbers
o-o
for each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
sentence-next
o-o
But when summarized,
o-o
the third count
o-o
can be omitted.
sentence-next
o-o
This means the
o-o
pairwise numbers
o-o
can be put into
o-o
a table, a square grid.
sentence-next
o-o
And each row
o-o
would be labeled
o-o
with the name
o-o
of a candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
And the columns
o-o
would be labeled
o-o
with the same
o-o
names in the same
o-o
sequence.
sentence-next
o-o
And each cell
o-o
would contain
o-o
one pairwise count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So if the
o-o
candidates
o-o
are named
o-o
Pinoke, Oscar,
o-o
Barack, and
o-o
Hypatia,
o-o
it would be
o-o
a four by four
o-o
grid, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're ready
o-o
to see the magic
o-o
of the counting
o-o
method I like
o-o
best.
sentence-next
o-o
It re hyphen-here arranges
o-o
the sequence of
o-o
candidates,
o-o
in the rows
o-o
and columns.
sentence-next
o-o
The goal is to
o-o
re hyphen-here arrange
o-o
the sequence
o-o
until the biggest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
upper hyphen-here right
o-o
triangular area
o-o
of the grid,
o-o
and the smallest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
other half,
o-o
the lower hyphen-here left
o-o
triangular area.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we look at
o-o
that sequence.
sentence-next
o-o
It indicates
o-o
not only who is
o-o
most popular,
o-o
but who is second
o-o
most popular,
o-o
who is third most
o-o
popular, and
o-o
so on down to
o-o
who is least
o-o
popular.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that method
o-o
called?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The Condorcet
o-o
Kemeny
o-o
method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That method
o-o
sounds more
o-o
convoluted
o-o
than building a
o-o
spiral staircase
o-o
down to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe that's the
o-o
kind of math
o-o
your landlord
o-o
uses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that the
o-o
fairest method?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's much better
o-o
than instant
o-o
runoff voting.
sentence-next
o-o
But the best
o-o
vote hyphen-here counting
o-o
system would be
o-o
even more complex.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So math
o-o
really is
o-o
the stairway
o-o
to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do math
o-o
experts
o-o
even have
o-o
all the
o-o
answers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's a
o-o
mathematical
o-o
proof that proves
o-o
it's not possible
o-o
for there to be
o-o
a voting method
o-o
that has no flaws.
sentence-next
o-o
So it's complicated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Sounds like life and
o-o
relationships.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There are some
o-o
fairness
o-o
characteristics,
o-o
criteria,
o-o
that voting methods
o-o
pass or fail.
sentence-next
o-o
Math geeks know which
o-o
counting methods
o-o
can sometimes
o-o
fail which criteria.
sentence-next
o-o
But there has been
o-o
no research
o-o
to measure
o-o
how begin-italics often end-italics
o-o
each method fails,
o-o
or rather
o-o
passes,
o-o
each one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why hasn't that
o-o
research
o-o
been done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Who would pay for
o-o
a search
o-o
to find the
o-o
best
o-o
replacement?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoever pays
o-o
for research
o-o
about
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Most of that
o-o
funding
o-o
comes from

the government.
sentence-next
o-o
Based on

priorities
o-o
established in

Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A black widow
o-o
spider's web of
o-o
corruption!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you know
o-o
how to avoid
o-o
vote splitting in
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
That allows
o-o
each party
o-o
to offer
o-o
more than just one
o-o
nominee.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
no more blocking.
sentence-next
o-o
Right?
sentence-next
o-o
Like how
o-o
Hillary
o-o
Clinton
o-o
got blocked
o-o
in two thousand eight?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's right.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I think
o-o
you're ready to
o-o
understand a
o-o
counting detail
o-o
that's subtle
o-o
yet significant.
sentence-next
o-o
Some people claim
o-o
that on a
o-o
ranked choice ballot
o-o
you can't mark
o-o
two candidates
o-o
at the same rank.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like marking
o-o
both Oscar
o-o
and Pinoke
o-o
as a third choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
Some people
o-o
call that an
o-o
begin-italics overvote end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
That's not
o-o
a problem for
o-o
begin-italics pairwise end-italics
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
But in
o-o
Australia,
o-o
where a voter
o-o
writes a
o-o
choice number
o-o
in a box,
o-o
and where
o-o
ballot counting
o-o
was done by hand
o-o
on election night,
o-o
they took a
o-o
shortcut.
sentence-next
o-o
When counting
o-o
reached an
o-o
overvote,
o-o
the ballot
o-o
was tossed
o-o
into an
o-o
overvote pile,
o-o
and the ballot
o-o
was ignored.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's what I'd

probably do.
