o-o
obscene

amounts.

o-o
Almost like
o-o
payouts spilling
o-o
onto the floor
o-o
from a slot
o-o
machine.

sentence-next
o-o

So you put Benjamins

before humans?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Think about this.
sentence-next
o-o
The love
o-o
of money
o-o
is built into

our language.
sentence-next

We have zillions
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

important.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Did you know
o-o
that long ago,
o-o
when writing
o-o
was new,
o-o
writing was used
o-o
for banking
o-o
and accounting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That was before
o-o
my time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That way money
o-o
was stored in banks.
sentence-next
o-o
Not in pockets
o-o
nor in bags
o-o
anymore.
sentence-next
o-o
That protected
o-o
traders from
o-o
pirates,
o-o
thieves, and
o-o
marauding
o-o
desperadoes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, pirates.
sentence-next
o-o
That was a
o-o
profession
o-o
back when
o-o
swashbuckling
o-o
exams
o-o
were open
o-o
to the poor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Pickpockets,
o-o
pirates, and
o-o
highway robbers
o-o
have become
o-o
as uncommon as
o-o
blue hyphen-here footed boobies.
sentence-next
o-o
Now that money
o-o
travels out of
o-o
sight at the
o-o
speed of light.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N the modern
o-o
version of pirates
o-o
is lawyers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Oh no.
sentence-next
o-o
Today's lawyers
o-o
are like
o-o
ancient scribes.
sentence-next
o-o
But they write
o-o
documents
o-o
quickly on
o-o
computer
o-o
screens
o-o
and paper.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead of
o-o
slowly on
o-o
clay tablets
o-o
and pyramid
o-o
walls.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how do you
o-o
choose where to
o-o
put the money
o-o
you've got?
sentence-next
o-o
To get more?
sentence-next
o-o
So you don't
o-o
end up singing
o-o
the blues?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Besides side hyphen-here stepping
o-o
traps set by
o-o
gold diggers,
o-o
I only invest
o-o
in high hyphen-here profit
o-o
deals.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones where I
o-o
become an
o-o
even bigger
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How come you
o-o
don't invest in
o-o
businesses
o-o
that sell products
o-o
and services
o-o
that are the best?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
The high-profit one
o-o
has to compensate
o-o
for the other eight.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones that flop.
sentence-next
o-o
Like Enron,
o-o
Theranos,
o-o
and America
o-o
Offline
o-o
diskettes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you're seeking
o-o
the one big
o-o
standout
o-o
you can
o-o
brag about?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah, yes.
sentence-next
o-o
The unicorn.
sentence-next
o-o
The one that
o-o
swells my pockets
o-o
til they burst.
sentence-next
o-o
Missing out on
o-o
one of those
o-o
would be the worst.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes,
o-o
one unicorn
o-o
in the forest
o-o
is worth more than
o-o
five zebras
o-o
in the brush.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Zebras?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Those are the
o-o
small businesses
o-o
that march to
o-o
riches slowly.
sentence-next
o-o
By making
o-o
something that
o-o
consumers
o-o
readily want.
sentence-next
o-o
And selling
o-o
a quality
o-o
version at an
o-o
affordable
o-o
price.
sentence-next
o-o
They don't need our
o-o
venture capital
o-o
for big
o-o
marketing
o-o
blitzes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't the whole
o-o
business scene
o-o
about selling what
o-o
customers want?
sentence-next
o-o
Or crave?
sentence-next
o-o
Like nicotine,
o-o
'n chocolate
o-o
milk
o-o
with Cheerios?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Sure.
sentence-next
o-o
And yet money
o-o
also can be
o-o
used to oppose
o-o
customer
o-o
resistance.
sentence-next
o-o
And even
o-o
customer
o-o
dissatisfaction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What I mean is,
o-o
well,
o-o
I'd like to
o-o
find funding
o-o
for a business
o-o
venture.
sentence-next
o-o
I've invented a
o-o
tool for cleaning
o-o
leaf gutters.
sentence-next
o-o
Without getting
o-o
on a ladder.
sentence-next
o-o
So I'll ask,
o-o
would ya invest
o-o
in a business
o-o
that sells the best
o-o
kind of tool
o-o
for that task?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Nah.
sentence-next
That would be
o-o
harder to
o-o
advertise
o-o
than a cordless
o-o
bungee hyphen-here jumping
o-o
franchise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lots of people
o-o
get hurt
o-o
when they hit
o-o
the dirt.
sentence-next
o-o
From falling off
o-o
a ladder.
sentence-next
While cleaning
o-o
a gutter.
sentence-next
o-o
Some land on
o-o
their head,
o-o
and end up dead.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That's a great spin!
sentence-next
o-o
Fear of falling.
sentence-next
o-o
That's a fear that
o-o
would sell lots of
o-o
product.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you have
o-o
a patent?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can't afford
o-o
that expense.
sentence-next
o-o
At thousands
o-o
of dollars,
o-o
that cost
o-o
is way too
o-o
immense.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Many tens of
o-o
thousands of
o-o
bucks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sucks.
sentence-next
o-o
I couldn't afford
o-o
even a few hundred
o-o
dollars to ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Why would I
o-o
invest?
sentence-next
o-o
Not unless
o-o
there's a
o-o
barrier
o-o
against
o-o
competitors.
sentence-next
o-o
There's gotta
o-o
be a
o-o
monopoly.
sentence-next
o-o
Either
o-o
a legal
o-o
monopoly,
o-o
or some kind of
o-o
virtual
o-o
monopoly.
sentence-next
o-o
That way my
o-o
investment
o-o
doesn't
o-o
evaporate
o-o
like a raindrop
o-o
falling into
o-o
Death Valley.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So a working
o-o
prototype's
o-o
not enough?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Sorry to sound
o-o
tough,
o-o
but that's too
o-o
rough.
sentence-next
o-o
That's as useless
o-o
as a machine hyphen-here gun mount
o-o
on the back of
o-o
a golf cart.
sentence-next
o-o
What the biz needs
o-o
to succeed
o-o
is a big amount
o-o
of income.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus customers
o-o
and
o-o
testimonials.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we might
o-o
lay out some
o-o
funds.
end-lyric
