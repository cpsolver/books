companies.

The ones you own,

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Yup.
sentence-next
o-o
The paperwork's

a hassle.
sentence-next
o-o
But those sly tricks

are legal.
sentence-next
o-o
All because

we pay off

politicians.

Don't lawyers

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Yes our lawyers

fight battles

They exterminate

sentence-next
o-o
Why's that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They write the bills

When you get

tax breaks,

o-o
how big are they?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Usually
o-o
at least
o-o
three dollars.

Often twenty.

Sometimes,

oh the really

really good ones,

they're more than

a hundred.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that all?
sentence-next
o-o
Only about twenty
o-o
dollars?
sentence-next
o-o
After donating

hundreds or

Three or twenty

Let's say some

fifty thousand

To the right

extra profits

because of a

subsidy, or
o-o
legal

monopoly?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Yup!

o-o
It's a great

sentence-next

That's
o-o
return on

investment.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
That makes

a roulette wheel

painfully slow
o-o
way to make

money.
end-lyric

Another trick
o-o
is to own

newspapers and

TV stations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those make out

like bandits?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's not for

sentence-next
o-o
That's so when there's
o-o
dirty linen
o-o
in a biz

we own

it doesn't

become known.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How about
o-o
news sources
o-o
you don't own?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
The business buys

sentence-next
o-o
Have you noticed
o-o
that embarrassing
o-o
stories about
o-o
grocery stores
o-o
never appear
o-o
in newspapers?
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
grocery stores
o-o
pay for lots
o-o
of those
o-o
colorful
o-o
newspaper
o-o
ads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That protection

racket's not

what a small store

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
My dear boy,
o-o
there's no money

o-o
It's big businesses

sentence-next
o-o
The really big
o-o
ones are chains

I know someone

Can't he buy ads

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Only costly

Well, 'til

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are there yet
o-o
other tricks?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Doing tricks
o-o
keeps a corporation
o-o
as busy as
o-o
an escort
o-o
in Las Vegas
o-o
during convention season.
sentence-next
o-o
Another trick is
o-o
big corporations
o-o
hire the big four
o-o
accounting firms
o-o
to get around laws
o-o
that were co-written
o-o
by those big four
o-o
accounting firms.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's,
o-o
er,
o-o
a sweet deal.
sentence-next
o-o
For the
o-o
corporations.
sentence-next
o-o
But thinkin'
o-o
of me,
o-o
what's the best
o-o
kind of biz
o-o
to be?
sentence-next
o-o
I wanna
o-o
become an
o-o
entrepreneur.
sentence-next
o-o
What's the best
o-o
strategy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
To become
o-o
a big cheese,
o-o
put the squeeze
o-o
on customers.
sentence-next
o-o
Become the

bottleneck
o-o
between supply
o-o
and demand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you mean
o-o
extortion's
o-o
the best kind of
o-o
plan?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
To see what
o-o
I mean,
o-o
consider the
o-o
music industry.
sentence-next
o-o
The way it was
o-o
years ago,
o-o
before a
o-o
recording
o-o
studio
o-o
got squeezed
o-o
into a
o-o
laptop
o-o
computer.
sentence-next
o-o
Back then,
o-o
cutting
o-o
a record,
o-o
literally,
o-o
meant cutting grooves
o-o
on a master
o-o
disk.
sentence-next
o-o
That process
o-o
used very
o-o
expensive
o-o
equipment
o-o
to transform
o-o
sound waves
o-o
into vibrations
o-o
of the cutting
o-o
needle.
sentence-next
o-o
That equipment
o-o
was so rare
o-o
that musicians
o-o
would work for cheap.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Or trade sex
o-o
for a record deal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Often
o-o
that was a perk.
sentence-next
o-o
But times have changed.
sentence-next
o-o
Now a
o-o
microphone
o-o
and an iPad
o-o
plus some apps
o-o
do it all.
sentence-next
o-o
From making
o-o
an album to
o-o
selling it
o-o
online.
sentence-next
o-o
So that pinch point,
o-o
that bottleneck,
o-o
is gone.
sentence-next
o-o
And with it went
o-o
lots of profit,
o-o
status,
o-o
and perks.
sentence-next
o-o
Now,
o-o
music hyphen-here industry
o-o
lawyers
o-o
hold their grip
o-o
by threatening
o-o
to sue any pub,
o-o
tavern, bar, or
o-o
restaurant
o-o
that doesn't buy
o-o
a license
o-o
to play the
o-o
copyrighted
o-o
music those
o-o
lawyers control.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
that's why we
o-o
can't sing the
o-o
Beatles song
o-o
begin-italics
Let It Be
end-italics
o-o
in public.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I see.
sentence-next
o-o
Record labels
o-o
lost their
o-o
bottleneck
o-o
because they
o-o
used to
o-o
monopolize
o-o
the
o-o
technology
o-o
that now fits
o-o
inside
o-o
a tablet
o-o
app.
sentence-next
o-o
Aren't newspapers
o-o
losing their
o-o
grip too?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
And movie
o-o
producers.
sentence-next
o-o
And book
o-o
publishers.
sentence-next
o-o
And radio
o-o
and TV
o-o
stations.
sentence-next
o-o
They lost their
o-o
monopolies.
sentence-next
o-o
Now those
o-o
industries
o-o
are like airplanes
o-o
dropping from
o-o
the sky in a
o-o
tailspin.
sentence-next
o-o
So the trick
o-o
is to find
o-o
a new
o-o
bottleneck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Doesn't a patent
o-o
provide a
o-o
bottleneck?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
In theory,
o-o
yeah.
sentence-next
o-o
But really,
o-o
a patent
o-o
bottleneck
o-o
only works for
o-o
a big big
o-o
invention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So inventing's
o-o
a dead end?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
If you could find
o-o
a genius
o-o
who could keep
o-o
your business
o-o
innovative
o-o
and out in front
o-o
of competitors,
o-o
that'd be sweet.
sentence-next
o-o
Very profitable.
sentence-next
o-o
But a
o-o
creative
o-o
genius is
o-o
rare and
o-o
doesn't work
o-o
for cheap.
sentence-next
o-o
And when you post
o-o
a job opening
o-o
like that,
o-o
the job
o-o
applicants are
o-o
pompous artists,
o-o
unemployed
o-o
writers, and
o-o
people like
o-o
ditsy
o-o
Dixie
o-o
Dinah from
o-o
North Carolina.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the idea
o-o
behind a
o-o
monopoly
o-o
is to block
o-o
competitors?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That's the key.
sentence-next
o-o
A technology
o-o
monopoly
o-o
or a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
are two of the
o-o
best.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
From what you said,
o-o
a business
o-o
you'd invest in
o-o
must be legal.
sentence-next
o-o
So why have you
o-o
been sayin'
o-o
legal
o-o
monopoly?
sentence-next
o-o
Instead of just
o-o
monopoly?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Legal monopoly
o-o
refers to a
o-o
monopoly
o-o
that's created
o-o
by a law.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
An example
o-o
would give me
o-o
a clue
o-o
'bout what you're
o-o
referrin'
o-o
to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Have you heard
o-o
of an herb
o-o
named stevia?
sentence-next
o-o
It's a natural
o-o
sweetener.
sentence-next
o-o
There are laws
o-o
that block
o-o
stevia
o-o
from appearing
o-o
on grocery
o-o
shelves next to
o-o
sugar or
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners.
sentence-next
o-o
That protects
o-o
profits
o-o
for sugar
o-o
companies,
o-o
'n makers of
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So cookies
o-o
could be made
o-o
sweet
o-o
naturally
o-o
with less
o-o
sugar?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's better
o-o
in drinks
o-o
than baked goods.
sentence-next
o-o
But yeah,
o-o
sugar and
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners
o-o
have less
o-o
competition
o-o
because of
o-o
that law.
sentence-next
o-o
And speaking of
o-o
sugar,
o-o
long ago
o-o
Congress passed
o-o
a law against
o-o
buying sugar
o-o
that's grown
o-o
outside the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
an inside
o-o
scam.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Here in the states
o-o
we pay way more,
o-o
sometimes
o-o
almost twice
o-o
the price,
o-o
compared to
o-o
other
o-o
nations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Coffee'd

price hike.
