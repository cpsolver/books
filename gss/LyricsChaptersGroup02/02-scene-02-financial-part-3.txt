Doesn't a patent
o-o
provide a
o-o
bottleneck?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
In theory,
o-o
yeah.
sentence-next
o-o
But really,
o-o
a patent
o-o
bottleneck
o-o
only works for
o-o
a big big
o-o
invention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So inventing's
o-o
a dead end?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
If you could find
o-o
a genius
o-o
who could keep
o-o
your business
o-o
innovative
o-o
and out in front
o-o
of competitors,
o-o
that'd be sweet.
sentence-next
o-o
Very profitable.
sentence-next
o-o
But a
o-o
creative
o-o
genius is
o-o
rare and
o-o
doesn't work
o-o
for cheap.
sentence-next
o-o
And when you post
o-o
a job opening
o-o
like that,
o-o
the job
o-o
applicants are
o-o
pompous artists,
o-o
unemployed
o-o
writers, and
o-o
people like
o-o
ditsy
o-o
Dixie
o-o
Dinah from
o-o
North Carolina.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the idea
o-o
behind a
o-o
monopoly
o-o
is to block
o-o
competitors?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That's the key.
sentence-next
o-o
A technology
o-o
monopoly
o-o
or a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
are two of the
o-o
best.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
From what you said,
o-o
a business
o-o
you'd invest in
o-o
must be legal.
sentence-next
o-o
So why have you
o-o
been sayin'
o-o
legal
o-o
monopoly?
sentence-next
o-o
Instead of just
o-o
monopoly?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Legal monopoly
o-o
refers to a
o-o
monopoly
o-o
that's created
o-o
by a law.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
An example
o-o
would give me
o-o
a clue
o-o
'bout what you're
o-o
referrin'
o-o
to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Have you heard
o-o
of an herb
o-o
named stevia?
sentence-next
o-o
It's a natural
o-o
sweetener.
sentence-next
o-o
There are laws
o-o
that block
o-o
stevia
o-o
from appearing
o-o
on grocery
o-o
shelves next to
o-o
sugar or
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners.
sentence-next
o-o
That protects
o-o
profits
o-o
for sugar
o-o
companies,
o-o
'n makers of
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So cookies
o-o
could be made
o-o
cheaper?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's better
o-o
in drinks
o-o
than baked goods.
sentence-next
o-o
But yeah,
o-o
sugar and
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners
o-o
have less
o-o
competition
o-o
because of
o-o
that law.
sentence-next
o-o
And speaking of
o-o
sugar,
o-o
long ago
o-o
Congress passed
o-o
a law against
o-o
buying sugar
o-o
that's grown
o-o
outside the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
an inside
o-o
scam.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Here in the states
o-o
we pay way more,
o-o
sometimes
o-o
almost twice
o-o
the price,
o-o
compared to
o-o
other
o-o
nations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Coffee'd
o-o
taste sweeter
o-o
without that
o-o
price hike.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
And there are laws
o-o
that protect
o-o
drug companies
o-o
from the herbal
o-o
industry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Drugs are
o-o
illegal.
sentence-next
o-o
But drug companies
o-o
are legal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Not those drugs.
sentence-next
o-o
The legal kind.
sentence-next
o-o
Pharmaceuticals.
sentence-next
o-o
They avoid
o-o
competition
o-o
from herb
o-o
sellers
o-o
because laws
o-o
outlaw
o-o
health claims
o-o
for substances
o-o
that don't have
o-o
negative
o-o
side effects.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that mean
o-o
food also
o-o
can't claim
o-o
health
o-o
benefits?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I admire your
o-o
mental
o-o
agility.
sentence-next
o-o
But don't get
o-o
too cheeky.
sentence-next
o-o
In addition
o-o
to that partial
o-o
legal
o-o
monopoly,
o-o
pharmaceutical
o-o
companies
o-o
get huge tax
o-o
deductions
o-o
because drug
o-o
testing
o-o
qualifies as
o-o
research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those are slick
o-o
tricks.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
gettin' a law
o-o
that creates a
o-o
monopoly,
o-o
'cause it's
o-o
automatically
o-o
legal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Did you know
o-o
that companies
o-o
like Turbo Tax
o-o
and Quickbooks
o-o
pay members
o-o
of Congress
o-o
to keep tax laws
o-o
complex?
sentence-next
o-o
That increases
o-o
demand for
o-o
their services.
sentence-next
o-o
...
o-o
So now,
o-o
is all of this
o-o
making sense?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
As clear as mud
o-o
dried out on
o-o
a windshield.
sentence-next
o-o
Up close and
o-o
easy to see.
sentence-next
o-o
Thanks for the
o-o
clarity!
sentence-next
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
I do have
o-o
a question
o-o
about somethin'
o-o
you said.
sentence-next
o-o
Part hyphen-here time you
o-o
do some kind of
o-o
trading.
sentence-next
o-o
What's that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Commodity
o-o
trading.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you buy
o-o
and sell
o-o
ketchup, mayo,
o-o
and mustard?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Those are
o-o
condiments.
sentence-next
o-o
Commodities
o-o
include sugar,
o-o
soybeans, wheat,
o-o
and oil.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's just some
o-o
certain kinds
o-o
of foods?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
By oil I mean
o-o
barrels of
o-o
crude oil.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's for
o-o
really hungry
o-o
people
o-o
with no taste?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Commodities
o-o
also include
o-o
gold, silver,
o-o
and copper.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What do jewelry
o-o
and food have
o-o
in common?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Those and other
o-o
things are
o-o
bought and sold
o-o
as raw materials.
sentence-next
o-o
In huge amounts,
o-o
like cargo
o-o
container
o-o
amounts.
sentence-next
o-o
Heating oil,
o-o
for furnaces,
o-o
goes up in price
o-o
at the beginning
o-o
of winter.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what I buy
o-o
online
o-o
while it's cheaper.
sentence-next
o-o
A week or two
o-o
later,
o-o
when the weather
o-o
is colder,
o-o
I click
o-o
a button
o-o
on my
o-o
trading app,
o-o
and I've earned
o-o
a nice
o-o
profit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds slick.
sentence-next
o-o
Can you teach me
o-o
that trick?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
The price
o-o
of a single
o-o
contract can
o-o
go up or down
o-o
by thousands
o-o
of dollars
o-o
within
o-o
an hour.
sentence-next
o-o
It's only for
o-o
those of us
o-o
who can afford
o-o
to wake up
o-o
and discover
o-o
it went the
o-o
wrong way
o-o
by tens
o-o
of thousands
o-o
of dollars.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then back to
o-o
owning a
o-o
business.
sentence-next
o-o
For that
o-o
are there
o-o
other tricks?
sentence-next
o-o
For getting
o-o
big profits?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As many as an
o-o
eagle has feathers.
sentence-next
o-o
Another is
o-o
slowing down
o-o
product
o-o
innovations.
sentence-next
o-o
If a product
o-o
takes too big
o-o
of a leap,
o-o
we miss out on
o-o
consumers
o-o
paying for each
o-o
slight
o-o
improvement.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the
o-o
most important
o-o
trick?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That has to be
o-o
giving
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributions
o-o
to political
o-o
candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
After they
o-o
get re hyphen-here elected
o-o
they protect
o-o
the laws that give
o-o
our business
o-o
tax break after
o-o
tax break.
sentence-next
o-o
And they
o-o
protect our
o-o
legal
o-o
monopolies,
o-o
and
o-o
taxpayer hyphen-here funded
o-o
subsidies.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why big
o-o
businesses pay
o-o
six hyphen-here figure
o-o
salaries
o-o
so freely.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah yes, money
o-o
in politics.
sentence-next
o-o
I know 'bout that.
sentence-next
o-o
But I don't yet
o-o
understand
o-o
why us voters,
o-o
er,
o-o
...
o-o
how it works.
sentence-next
o-o
Non hyphen-here rich voters
o-o
greatly outnumber
o-o
the wealthy,
o-o
so how can
o-o
money
o-o
outweigh those votes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
We've
o-o
infiltrated
o-o
both parties.
sentence-next
o-o
This is how we
o-o
control who wins
o-o
the primary
o-o
elections of
o-o
both parties.
sentence-next
o-o
So general
o-o
elections are
o-o
between a
o-o
puppet Republican
o-o
and a puppet
o-o
Democrat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah, puppets win.
sentence-next
o-o
I knew that part.
sentence-next
o-o
But I hadn't
o-o
noticed the
o-o
infiltration
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
In the primary,
o-o
the winner's always
o-o
from the correct party,
o-o
so the money
o-o
bias goes
o-o
unchallenged.
sentence-next
o-o
In the
o-o
general
o-o
election
o-o
Republican
o-o
voters
o-o
assume
o-o
Democrats
o-o
are dimwits,
o-o
and Democratic
o-o
voters
o-o
assume
o-o
Republicans
o-o
are dimwits.
sentence-next
o-o
But then
o-o
it's too late.
sentence-next
o-o
For added
o-o
insurance
o-o
in a tight race
o-o
we might give a
o-o
bit of money
o-o
to an unpopular
o-o
candidate
o-o
we hate.
sentence-next
o-o
But we give
o-o
far more to
o-o
the one we
o-o
choose.
sentence-next
o-o
That way we
o-o
can't lose.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How come news
o-o
reporters
o-o
don't expose
o-o
what's behind
o-o
those magic
o-o
tricks?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That flow of money
o-o
is harder to follow
o-o
than a mouse
o-o
running through
o-o
a cornfield.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as when
o-o
rich wives register
o-o
as Democrats
o-o
and give family money
o-o
to conservative
o-o
Democratic politicians
o-o
during primary elections.
end-lyric

There's somethin' else

going on

isn't there?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You are bright!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes, we pay news sources
o-o
to entertain and

sentence-next
o-o
The biggest of
o-o
distractions are
o-o
those endless

debates about

issues of

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Religion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Abortion is the

really useful one.
sentence-next
o-o
With that the

Republican

party has lots

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the Republican
o-o
party doesn't
o-o
really care 'bout
o-o
abortion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
We sorta care,
o-o
but not as much
o-o
as tax breaks
o-o
and subsidies
o-o
and our legal

monopolies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I have to admit
o-o
voters don't see
