If I were to
o-o
buy a house,
o-o
they'd loan for that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
A mortgage,
o-o
hah.
sentence-next
o-o
It doesn't work
o-o
like that.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead
o-o
the bank
o-o
buys the
o-o
house.
sentence-next
o-o
Your down payment's
o-o
big enough
o-o
to pay for
o-o
a year of
o-o
law school.
sentence-next
o-o
So if soon
o-o
you lose your job
o-o
and miss a
o-o
payment,
o-o
a remittance,
o-o
or two,
o-o
they sell the house.
sentence-next
o-o
Then you and a
o-o
couple of
o-o
other
o-o
delinquent
o-o
homeowners
o-o
have paid for a
o-o
banker's kid
o-o
to become
o-o
a lawyer.
sentence-next
o-o
That path leads to
o-o
homelessness.
sentence-next
o-o
Unless you have
o-o
trustworthy
o-o
income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So banks
o-o
don't loan
o-o
money?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They still do
o-o
a bit.
sentence-next
o-o
Occasionally.
sentence-next
o-o
Mostly now they're
o-o
high hyphen-here rolling gamblers
o-o
that make casinos
o-o
look like kids
o-o
playing the
o-o
board game
o-o
Monopoly.
sentence-next
o-o
They make
o-o
big money
o-o
by buying and
o-o
selling, ah,
o-o
another word
o-o
for money,
o-o
derivatives.
sentence-next
o-o
Big things,
o-o
not small things.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What're
o-o
derivatives?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Those are contracts
o-o
on paper, or the
o-o
cyberspace
o-o
equivalent,
o-o
written by lawyers.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of times
o-o
they're promises
o-o
to pay money if
o-o
something happens.
sentence-next
o-o
Like if interest
o-o
rates rise or fall.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds
o-o
a lot like
o-o
gamblin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It is.
sentence-next
o-o
And gambling,
o-o
that's what we
o-o
venture
o-o
capitalists
o-o
do too.
sentence-next
o-o
We supply
o-o
capital.
sentence-next
o-o
It's like those
o-o
ancient sea
o-o
voyages.
sentence-next
o-o
Someone had to
o-o
buy the ship,
o-o
pay sailors,
o-o
and stock up
o-o
on gruel
o-o
and limes,
o-o
before they could
o-o
sail from the dock.
sentence-next
o-o
Then,
o-o
on return,
o-o
if they returned,
o-o
the cargo was
o-o
sold.
sentence-next
That's when
o-o
the backer got
o-o
his share of
o-o
the gold.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N the captain
o-o
'n crew got what?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What they got was
o-o
a temporary pass
o-o
to the middle class.
sentence-next
o-o
Until they got
o-o
swindled or
o-o
badly beaten
o-o
in a
o-o
casino.
sentence-next
o-o
Or stuck with
o-o
alimony
o-o
payments
o-o
that would fund
o-o
a small bank.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But the backer
o-o
got more?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Of course.
sentence-next
o-o
'Cause he took
o-o
the biggest
o-o
risk.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember there
o-o
were pirates.
sentence-next
o-o
And sometimes
o-o
the winds
o-o
were not brisk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those times
o-o
were cruel and
o-o
barbaric.
sentence-next
o-o
And excitin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They were.
sentence-next
o-o
In those
o-o
ancient times
o-o
fighting was done
o-o
by soldiers.
sentence-next
o-o
Now fighting
o-o
is so much
o-o
safer.
sentence-next
o-o
It's done by
o-o
lawyers.
sentence-next
o-o
They fight with
o-o
legal
o-o
documents
o-o
instead of
o-o
swords.
sentence-next
o-o
And instead of
o-o
wearing armor,
o-o
or bullet hyphen-here proof
o-o
vests,
o-o
they wear
o-o
colorful
o-o
neckties.
sentence-next
o-o
Or Victoria's
o-o
Secret
o-o
lingerie.
sentence-next
o-o
Quite civilized
o-o
nowadays.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see
o-o
how money works.
sentence-next
o-o
So how can I
o-o
switch from bein'
o-o
an employee
o-o
to become
o-o
an employer?
sentence-next
o-o
Ownin' a small
o-o
business,
o-o
that's my dream.
sentence-next
o-o
Some success,
o-o
financially.
sentence-next
o-o
So I can buy
o-o
a fixer hyphen-here upper house,
o-o
pay for ultra hyphen-here fast
o-o
access to,
o-o
er, ...,
o-o
kitten videos,
o-o
'n drive a car
o-o
that didn't come off
o-o
Henry Ford's
o-o
production line.
sentence-next
o-o
Not a
o-o
private jet.
sentence-next
o-o
Not even just
o-o
a log cabin
o-o
in the woods.
sentence-next
o-o
Not yet.
sentence-next
o-o
I just want
o-o
fair rewards
o-o
for my hard work.
sentence-next
o-o
How do I
o-o
make that leap?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You need to
o-o
dig deep,
o-o
to develop
o-o
a compelling
o-o
vision.
sentence-next
o-o
A lofty one
o-o
that will
o-o
inspire.
sentence-next
o-o
Then you hire
o-o
workers who
o-o
follow your
o-o
vision like
o-o
ducklings behind
o-o
their mom.
sentence-next
o-o
You work them hard.
sentence-next
o-o
You hire lawyers
o-o
to sue
o-o
competitors.
sentence-next
o-o
And of course you
o-o
hire marketing
o-o
folks who
o-o
super hyphen-here size
o-o
your PR
o-o
blitzes.
sentence-next
o-o
They'll make
o-o
ads that are
o-o
so grand
o-o
that consumers
o-o
will trust
o-o
your brand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So I should
o-o
start a cult?
sentence-next
o-o
'N of course
o-o
there'd be
o-o
an app
o-o
with that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
A cult
o-o
would put you
o-o
on the wealthy
o-o
map.
sentence-next
o-o
If you shift
o-o
the idolatry
o-o
to money.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead of
o-o
focusing
o-o
on death,
o-o
or sex,
o-o
or fashion color.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact,
o-o
that's not a bad way
o-o
to say
o-o
what business
o-o
leaders
o-o
really do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It sounds like
o-o
makin' money
o-o
is about lyin'
o-o
'n cheatin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's not lying.
sentence-next
o-o
That's not cheating.
sentence-next
o-o
It's marketing
o-o
and stepping on
o-o
toes.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact
o-o
anything goes.
sentence-next
o-o
But not lying
o-o
and cheating.
sentence-next
o-o
'Cause
o-o
that lands you in
o-o
the slammer.
sentence-next
o-o
That'd be a
o-o
bummer
o-o
'cause
o-o
your bank accounts
o-o
in prison
o-o
are as useless
o-o
as a light saber
o-o
against an
o-o
assault
o-o
rifle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
To get ahead
o-o
financially
o-o
I have to step
o-o
on people's toes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Or a gentle push
o-o
to the nose.
sentence-next
o-o
Business is all about
o-o
competition.
sentence-next
o-o
It's the very
o-o
foundation
o-o
of a free market.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Stomping on toes.
sentence-next
o-o
Anything goes.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the trick of
o-o
corporations.
sentence-next
o-o
How come they're the
o-o
winners in the
o-o
business world?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah,
o-o
the key is
o-o
politics.
sentence-next
o-o
We shareholders
o-o
and investors
o-o
give money to
o-o
politicians.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to us
o-o
they listen.
sentence-next
o-o
That's not cheating.
sentence-next
o-o
It's not against
o-o
any law.
sentence-next
o-o
I share mula with
o-o
any politician
o-o
who passes laws
o-o
that dump big
o-o
amounts of
o-o
golden coins
o-o
into my
o-o
bank accounts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
After your
o-o
money buys
o-o
you a louder
o-o
voice,
o-o
in politics,
o-o
what do ya get
o-o
from the
o-o
politicians
o-o
you buy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Tax breaks and
o-o
subsidies.
sentence-next
o-o
And sometimes
o-o
legal monopolies.
sentence-next
o-o
Oh I do
o-o
love these.
sentence-next
o-o
With these breaks,
o-o
my business
o-o
thrives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But not so
o-o
for others' lives.
sentence-next
o-o
The customers.
sentence-next
o-o
The employees.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
If someone else
o-o
gets beaten,
o-o
that's their choice.
sentence-next
o-o
They need to speak up
o-o
with a louder voice.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Don't you fear
o-o
the folks who
o-o
want to tax
o-o
the wealthy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
The business
o-o
that I
o-o
closely own,
o-o
with more profit
o-o
it could buy
o-o
a beach house,
o-o
or ski lodge,
o-o
or yacht.
sentence-next
o-o
Something I
o-o
don't yet got.
sentence-next
o-o
Besides my
o-o
timeshare in
o-o
Hawai'i.
sentence-next
o-o
My biz buddies
o-o
and I would
o-o
share it.
sentence-next
o-o
Or rent it to me
o-o
for almost free.
sentence-next
o-o
That tactic
o-o
evades hefty
o-o
income
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
So an extra
o-o
tax on the rich,
o-o
it misses me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the key is
o-o
ownin' a biz?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
And that
o-o
qualifies me
o-o
to become a
o-o
board
o-o
member
o-o
at two other
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
There are places

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Not that kind
o-o
of board.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is it like
o-o
redwood or
o-o
cardboard?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
A board
o-o
of directors
o-o
is the legal

entity

sentence-next
o-o
We represent

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
board is the name

of the table

where deciders
o-o
decide.
sentence-next
o-o
I mean,
o-o
where
o-o
directors
o-o
direct.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
We can even fire
o-o
the CEO.
sentence-next
o-o
That's chief

executive
o-o
officer.
sentence-next
o-o
At those
o-o
board meetings,
o-o
that's meetings
o-o
of the board
o-o
of directors,
o-o
we vote
o-o
to reduce
o-o
labor costs.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we vote
o-o
to give
o-o
ourselves
o-o
a huge bonus
o-o
using the profit
o-o
from the
o-o
previous year's
o-o
labor hyphen-here cost chop.

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's how come you

ambee sings-vc amenn
Do you

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm seeing

lots of stuff

I hadn't seen
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
The cost of
o-o
travel to
o-o
those board
o-o
meetings
o-o
is deductible.
sentence-next
o-o
That's another
o-o
money word
o-o
that brings me joy.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus I
o-o
lounge for days
o-o
before and after
o-o
at a fancy spot
o-o
with a date
o-o
who's hot.
sentence-next
o-o
Or at least I
o-o
rent a Beemer
o-o
convertible
o-o
and indulge
o-o
in rich meals
o-o
with someone like
o-o
flirty
o-o
Felicity
o-o
Dimwittle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the tax breaks
o-o

o-o
are for
o-o
companies.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones you own,
o-o
or own shares of?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Yup.
sentence-next
o-o
The paperwork's
o-o
a hassle.
sentence-next

But those sly tricks

politicians.
