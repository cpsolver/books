begin-comment Illustration:
early evening (end of workday),
small outdoor balcony, with metal railing, part of condominium building,
higher than first floor,
small round table with two outdoor chairs facing it,
another two identical chairs in corners of balcony,
Damien sitting somewhat slumped forward onto table with arms on table,
cup of tea or coffee on table in front of him,
his fiance standing on right side of table and facing him
and is holding coffee cup.
Damien is racially mixed with latino or Puerto Rican parent,
short, NOT handsome in face but healthy body shape,
wearing jeans and shirt that would be appropriate for a trade such as installing hardwood floors.
His fiance is somewhat good looking and later will appear with her father who owns a business that earns lots of money, so she should be somewhat nicely dressed but in casual attire, has healthy body shape but not too beautiful in face.
