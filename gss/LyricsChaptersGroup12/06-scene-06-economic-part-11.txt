So what do those
o-o
corrupt
o-o
business

owners
o-o
oppose?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They oppose
o-o
innovations
o-o
they fear
o-o
will reduce

their income.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as

owners of

opposing

synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon
o-o
fuel.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's synthetic
o-o
whatever?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
o-o
refers to gases

manufactured

o-o
The process

sentence-next
o-o
It will get

carbon from

carbon dioxide

in the atmosphere ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which we have too much of.

from water.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So doing
o-o
what plants do?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But much more
o-o
efficiently.
sentence-next
o-o
For just storing
o-o
energy.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
compared to
o-o
using crops to
o-o
generate ethanol.
sentence-next
o-o
That enriches
o-o
a few wealthy
o-o
people who
o-o
have a legal

monopoly
o-o
on ethanol.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If synthetic hydro ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
... is such a good thing,
o-o
what's blocking that
o-o
from happening?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's no
o-o
economic
o-o
incentive.
sentence-next
o-o
The people who
o-o
have the skills
o-o
to figure it out
o-o
cannot get paid

to do that

research.
sentence-next
o-o
And oil
o-o
companies
o-o
can earn more

money by

blocking that

research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
more bad feedback

loops.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
This time it's
o-o
the lack of a

feedback loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there something
o-o
from history that
o-o
would reveal
o-o
how to make
o-o
good changes
o-o
happen sooner?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When Kodak tried to
o-o
develop, so to speak,
o-o
color film for cameras,
o-o
their research labs
o-o
were only making slow
o-o
progress.
sentence-next
o-o
But two young
o-o
chemistry graduates
o-o
were making better
o-o
progress, so Kodak
o-o
hired them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What was the secret
o-o
that gave them an
o-o
advantage?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They were singers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The secret was singing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
At that time
o-o
color darkrooms
o-o
were completely dark.
sentence-next
o-o
There was no way
o-o
to see a timer.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet the chemistry
o-o
was very time hyphen-here critical.
sentence-next
o-o
So they
o-o
sang songs together
o-o
and used the
o-o
timing of songs
o-o
as their timer
o-o
for chemical
o-o
reactions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're saying
o-o
we need to
o-o
take up singing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It illustrates
o-o
that breakthroughs
o-o
often require
o-o
sub hyphen-here breakthroughs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So this means we
o-o
need to figure out
o-o
some kind of
o-o
innovation
o-o
that will help spread
o-o
the bigger
o-o
innovation
o-o
of fairer voting
o-o
methods?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Look for a way
o-o
to break the bad

feedback loops
o-o
that block fairer

voting.
sentence-next
o-o
Drill a hole through

economic

prosperity
o-o
that

civilization

is waiting for.
sentence-next
o-o
Then voters
o-o
can elect
o-o
leaders who will

be begin-italics their end-italics puppets.
sentence-next
o-o
Until then
o-o
politicians
o-o
are the puppets
o-o
of what you call
o-o
the political down.
sentence-next
o-o
Many of them
o-o
earn their money

in ways

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Any more tips?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
One way to fight
o-o
against bad
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
is to create
o-o
opposing
o-o
good feedback loops.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
ones that increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
again.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Democracy
o-o
itself is a
o-o
good
o-o
feedback loop.
sentence-next
o-o
It yields
o-o
far better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
compared to
o-o
monarchy and
o-o
dictatorship.
sentence-next
o-o
That makes
o-o
oppressed people
o-o
jealous.
sentence-next
o-o
That jealousy
o-o
brought down the
o-o
Berlin wall,
o-o
toppled the
o-o
dictators in
o-o
eastern Europe,
o-o
and ended
o-o
the Cold War
o-o
against the
o-o
Soviet
o-o
Union.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
Jealousy
o-o
isn't always
o-o
a bad thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm learning that
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
are sometimes bad
o-o
and sometimes good.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good and bad
o-o
are just shortcut
o-o
ways to say
o-o
something
o-o
has lots of
o-o
advantages
o-o
or lots of
o-o
disadvantages.
sentence-next
o-o
But it depends
o-o
on who you are
o-o
as to whether
o-o
a change is an
o-o
advantage
o-o
or disadvantage.
sentence-next
o-o
It can even be
o-o
both good and bad
o-o
for the same
o-o
person.
sentence-next
o-o
Like when
o-o
Henry Ford
o-o
paid his workers
o-o
higher than
o-o
usual salaries.
sentence-next
o-o
That increased
o-o
his labor costs.
sentence-next
o-o
But those
o-o
employees
o-o
could then afford
o-o
to buy Ford cars.
sentence-next
o-o
That increased
o-o
his profits.

So this is the

savory pie

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Shareholders
o-o
are shooting

bullets at

people reaching

savory pie.
sentence-next
o-o
Without

realizing
o-o
those people

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And sometimes

their employees.
sentence-next
o-o
And sometimes

shareholders.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow, so many
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to learn about.
sentence-next
o-o
And yet
o-o
I've played
o-o
computer games
o-o
that took longer
o-o
to learn about
o-o
than what
o-o
I've learned
o-o
today.

About the

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your insights

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But my head is full!
sentence-next
o-o
Yet now,
o-o
hopefully,
o-o
I can better
o-o
figure out how
o-o
to earn money
o-o
as an entrepreneur.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To do that
o-o
you need to
o-o
understand
o-o
an important
o-o
business
o-o
concept.
sentence-next
o-o
So here's a test.
sentence-next
o-o
But don't
o-o
get stressed.
sentence-next
o-o
It'll
o-o
stretch
o-o
your mind.
sentence-next

What do these

They got rich

through tech.

o-o
Technology.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's all my brain

can guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This isn't something

Ah yes.

Nikola Tesla.

Indeed,
