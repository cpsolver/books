I'm guessing that
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
are sometimes bad
o-o
and sometimes good.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good and bad
o-o
are just shortcut
o-o
ways to say
o-o
something
o-o
has lots of
o-o
advantages
o-o
or lots of
o-o
disadvantages.
sentence-next
o-o
But it depends
o-o
on who you are
o-o
as to whether
o-o
a change is an
o-o
advantage
o-o
or disadvantage.
sentence-next
o-o
It can even be
o-o
both good and bad
o-o
for the same
o-o
person.
sentence-next
o-o
Like when
o-o
Henry Ford
o-o
paid his workers
o-o
higher than
o-o
usual salaries.
sentence-next
o-o
That increased
o-o
his labor costs.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet also
o-o
it increased
o-o
his profits
o-o
because more of
o-o
his employees
o-o
bought Ford cars.

I'm realizing
o-o
that when
o-o
business owners
o-o
defend their
o-o
jumbo hyphen-here sized
o-o
slices of
o-o
savory pie,
o-o
they fail to
o-o
recognize
o-o
the people
o-o
they fight against
o-o
include their
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
And potential
o-o
customers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow, so many
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to learn about.
sentence-next
o-o
And yet
o-o
I've played
o-o
computer games
o-o
that took longer
o-o
to learn about
o-o
than what
o-o
I've learned
o-o
today.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your insights
o-o
are amazing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But my head is full!
sentence-next
o-o
Yet now,
o-o
hopefully,
o-o
I can better
o-o
figure out how
o-o
to earn money
o-o
as an
o-o
entrepreneur.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To do that
o-o
you need to
o-o
understand that
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
need to team up
o-o
with the right
o-o
people.
sentence-next
o-o
Think of it like
o-o
the end credits
o-o
of a movie.
sentence-next
o-o
The best movies
o-o
have lots
o-o
and lots
o-o
of names
o-o
in the credits.
sentence-next
o-o
You need to
o-o
understand
o-o
which role
o-o
fits your
o-o
skills.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to be
o-o
an inventor.
sentence-next
o-o
And I know
o-o
I need to find
o-o
a financial
o-o
backer.
sentence-next
o-o
To pay the cost
o-o
of getting
o-o
a patent.
