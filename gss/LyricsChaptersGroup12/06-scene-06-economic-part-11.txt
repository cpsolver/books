It seems like
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
are bad,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Most feedback loops,
o-o
the economic kind,
o-o
are good
o-o
for some people
o-o
and bad for
o-o
others.
sentence-next
o-o
Or the loop
o-o
can be both
o-o
good and bad
o-o
for the same
o-o
person.
sentence-next
o-o
Like when
o-o
Henry Ford
o-o
paid his workers
o-o
higher than
o-o
usual salaries.
sentence-next
o-o
That increased
o-o
his labor costs.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet also
o-o
it increased
o-o
his profits
o-o
because more of
o-o
his employees
o-o
bought Ford cars.

I'm realizing
o-o
that when
o-o
business owners
o-o
defend their
o-o
jumbo hyphen-here sized
o-o
slices of
o-o
savory pie,
o-o
they fail to
o-o
recognize
o-o
the people
o-o
they fight against
o-o
include their
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
And potential
o-o
customers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow,
o-o
I have a lot
o-o
yet to learn
o-o
about
o-o
feedback loops.
sentence-next
o-o
I wish there were
o-o
tutorial
o-o
videos
o-o
about the games of
o-o
elections
o-o
and economics.
sentence-next
o-o
Like there are for
o-o
computer games.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That reminds me.
sentence-next
o-o
You're an expert
o-o
in something called
o-o
begin-italics game theory end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
But we haven't
o-o
yet gotten
o-o
to that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
For your needs
o-o
the most
o-o
important part
o-o
of game theory
o-o
is better
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
name-mathprof
o-o
said you already
o-o
learned
o-o
those basics.
sentence-next
o-o
Everything
o-o
we discussed
o-o
today is about
o-o
playing games
o-o
in politics
o-o
and government
o-o
and business.
sentence-next
o-o
I taught you
o-o
some important
o-o
concepts.
sentence-next
o-o
But I avoided
o-o
teaching you the
o-o
terminology.
sentence-next
o-o
That's messier
o-o
than your
o-o
dog poop
o-o
loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
You're a
o-o
super duper
o-o
wise guru.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your insights
o-o
are amazing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But my head is full!
sentence-next
o-o
Yet now,
o-o
hopefully,
o-o
I can better
o-o
figure out how
o-o
to earn money
o-o
as an
o-o
entrepreneur.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To do that
o-o
you need to
o-o
understand that
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
need to team up
o-o
with the right
o-o
people.
sentence-next
o-o
Think of it like
o-o
the end credits
o-o
of a movie.
sentence-next
o-o
The best movies
o-o
have lots
o-o
and lots
o-o
of names
o-o
in the credits.
sentence-next
o-o
You need to
o-o
understand
o-o
which role
o-o
fits your
o-o
skills.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to be
o-o
an inventor.
sentence-next
o-o
And I know
o-o
I need to find
o-o
a financial
o-o
backer.
sentence-next
o-o
To pay the cost
o-o
of getting
o-o
a patent.
