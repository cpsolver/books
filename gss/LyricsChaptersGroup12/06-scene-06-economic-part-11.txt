So what do those
o-o
corrupt
o-o
business
o-o
owners
o-o
oppose?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They oppose
o-o
innovations
o-o
they fear
o-o
will reduce
o-o
their income.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as
o-o
owners of
o-o
Exxon shares
o-o
opposing
o-o
fully
o-o
synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon
o-o
fuel.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's synthetic
o-o
whatever?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
o-o
refers to gases
o-o
and liquids that
o-o
are chemically
o-o
manufactured
o-o
for use as
o-o
fuel.
sentence-next
o-o
The process

energy source.
sentence-next
o-o
It will get
o-o
carbon from
o-o
carbon dioxide
o-o
in the atmosphere ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which we have too much of.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
... and it will get 
o-o
hydrogen
o-o
from water.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So doin'
o-o
what plants do?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But much more
o-o
efficiently.
sentence-next
o-o
For just storing
o-o
energy.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
compared to
o-o
using crops to
o-o
generate ethanol.
sentence-next
o-o
Which enriches
o-o
a few wealthy
o-o
people who
o-o
have a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
on ethanol.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If synthetic hydro ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
... is such a good thing,
o-o
what's blockin' that
o-o
from happening?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's no
o-o
economic
o-o
incentive.
sentence-next
o-o
The people who
o-o
have the skills
o-o
to figure it out
o-o
cannot get paid
o-o
to do that
o-o
research.
sentence-next
o-o
And oil
o-o
companies
o-o
can earn more
o-o
money by
o-o
blocking that
o-o
research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
more bad feedback
o-o
loops.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
This time it's
o-o
the lack of a
o-o
good
o-o
feedback loop.
sentence-next
o-o
Also consider
o-o
that breakthroughs
o-o
may require
o-o
sub hyphen-here breakthroughs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So this means we
o-o
need to figure out
o-o
some kind of
o-o
innovation
o-o
that will help spread
o-o
the bigger
o-o
innovation
o-o
of fairer voting
o-o
methods?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Look for a way
o-o
to break the bad
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
that block fairer
o-o
voting.
sentence-next
o-o
Drill a hole through
o-o
the dam that

holds back
o-o
the flood of
o-o
fairness and
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
that
o-o
civilization
o-o
is waiting for.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Any more tips?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
One way to fight
o-o
against bad
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
is to create
o-o
opposing
o-o
good feedback loops.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
ones that increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
again.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Democracy
o-o
itself is a
o-o
good
o-o
feedback loop.
sentence-next
o-o
It yields
o-o
far better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
compared to
o-o
monarchy and
o-o
dictatorship.
sentence-next
o-o
That makes
o-o
oppressed people
o-o
jealous.
sentence-next
o-o
That jealousy
o-o
brought down the
o-o
Berlin wall,
o-o
toppled the
o-o
dictators in
o-o
eastern Europe,
o-o
and ended
o-o
the Cold War
o-o
against the
o-o
Soviet
o-o
Union.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
Jealousy
o-o
isn't always
o-o
a bad thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm learning that
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
are sometimes bad
o-o
and sometimes good.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good and bad
o-o
are just shortcut
o-o
ways to say
o-o
something
o-o
has lots of
o-o
advantages
o-o
or lots of
o-o
disadvantages.
sentence-next
o-o
But it depends
o-o
on who you are
o-o
as to whether
o-o
a change is an
o-o
advantage
o-o
or disadvantage.
sentence-next
o-o
It can even be
o-o
both good and bad
o-o
for the same
o-o
person.
sentence-next
o-o
Like when
o-o
Henry Ford
o-o
paid his workers
o-o
higher than
o-o
usual salaries.
sentence-next
o-o
That increased
o-o
his labor costs.
sentence-next
o-o
But those
o-o
employees
o-o
could then afford
o-o
to buy Ford cars.
sentence-next
o-o
That increased
o-o
his profits.

So this is the
o-o
savory pie
o-o
slicin'
o-o
concept?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Right now,
o-o
shareholders
o-o
are shooting
o-o
bullets at
o-o
people reaching
o-o
for
o-o
savory pie.
sentence-next
o-o
Without
o-o
realizing
o-o
some of
o-o
those people
o-o
getting hit
o-o
are the
o-o
company's
o-o
customers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And sometimes
o-o
their employees.
sentence-next
o-o
And sometimes
o-o
their fellow
o-o
shareholders.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow, so many
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to learn about.
sentence-next
o-o
And yet
o-o
I've played
o-o
computer games
o-o
that took longer
o-o
to learn about
o-o
than what
o-o
I've learned
o-o
today.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your insights
o-o
are amazing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But my head is full!
sentence-next
o-o
Yet now,
o-o
hopefully,
o-o
I can better
o-o
figure out how
o-o
to earn money
o-o
as an
o-o
entrepreneur.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To do that
o-o
you need to
o-o
understand that
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
need to team up
o-o
with the right
o-o
people.
sentence-next
o-o
Consider
o-o
Steve Jobs,
o-o
Bill Gates,
o-o
Elon Musk,
o-o
Walt Disney,
o-o
Thomas Edison,
o-o
George Westinghouse,
o-o
and
o-o
Giovanni Marconi.
sentence-next
o-o
Their success
o-o
was based on
o-o
working with,
o-o
or buying from,
o-o
or copying from,
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you know
o-o
about those
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I know
o-o
Steve Jobs
o-o
co hyphen-here founded
o-o
Apple with
o-o
another guy.
sentence-next
o-o
And so did Gates,
o-o
to create
o-o
Microsoft.
sentence-next
o-o
And I know
o-o
Musk hires
o-o
lots of smart
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
And Nikola
o-o
Tesla helped
o-o
some business
o-o
with electrical
o-o
power stuff.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Tesla almost
o-o
single hyphen-here handedly
o-o
designed the
o-o
electrical
o-o
power grid
o-o
system
o-o
we still use
o-o
today.
sentence-next
o-o
Westinghouse
o-o
provided
o-o
that funding.
sentence-next
o-o
Tesla also
o-o
invented
o-o
key parts of
o-o
radio
o-o
technology
o-o
that Giovanni
o-o
Marconi
o-o
commercialized.
sentence-next
o-o
But Marconi
o-o
didn't pay
o-o
anything
o-o
to Tesla.
sentence-next
o-o
And Tesla
o-o
did some
o-o
inventing for
o-o
Thomas Edison.
sentence-next
o-o
But Edison
o-o
didn't pay
o-o
what Tesla
o-o
thought Edison
o-o
had promised.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That stinks!
sentence-next
o-o
It's like
o-o
stealing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In the world
o-o
of business
o-o
the people
o-o
who control money
o-o
typically
o-o
got there
o-o
by going
o-o
up to the
o-o
boundaries
o-o
of what's legal.
sentence-next
o-o
And ethical.
sentence-next
o-o
Without jumping
o-o
over that
o-o
fence.
sentence-next
o-o
And they pay
o-o
very slick
o-o
lawyers to
o-o
convince the
o-o
judge or jury
o-o
they didn't
o-o
jump the fence
o-o
into illegal
o-o
territory.
sentence-next
o-o
The point is,
o-o
to be an
o-o
entrepreneur
o-o
you need to
o-o
understand
o-o
which role
o-o
fits your
o-o
skills.
sentence-next
o-o
And what
o-o
drives you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to be
o-o
an inventor.
sentence-next
o-o
And I know
o-o
I need to find
o-o
a financial
o-o
backer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You also need
o-o
to join with
o-o
marketing
o-o
and logistics
o-o
experts.
sentence-next
o-o
Think of it like
o-o
the end credits
o-o
of a movie.
sentence-next
o-o
The best movies
o-o
have lots
o-o
and lots
o-o
of names
o-o
in the credits.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You're saying
o-o
I need more

than just a

financial

backer.

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To be a

success,
o-o
yes.
