So why doesn't
o-o
history

teach more about

Who's got the

money it takes
o-o
to erect

statues and

finance trusts
o-o
that archive
o-o
the person's
o-o
scribbled

notes on

for use in

biographic

Edison,

Westinghouse,
o-o
Marconi,
o-o
and other
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
who win

economically.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see that
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who do the
o-o
magic
o-o
frequently
o-o
get burned
o-o
when it comes to
o-o
the money
o-o
they earn,
o-o
and overlooked
o-o
in autobiographic
o-o
history books.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's why I said
o-o
the important
o-o
part of history
o-o
is understanding
o-o
cause and effect.
sentence-next
o-o
And now do you see
o-o
what you should know
o-o
about entrepreneurs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Alongside,
o-o
or behind,
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Or underneath,
o-o
getting stepped on.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK,
o-o
underneath
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
are the

creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who create things
o-o
of value that
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
sell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
And after
o-o
creating the
o-o
innovation
o-o
that starts the
o-o
business,
o-o
those creators
o-o
need to
o-o
create yet more
o-o
innovations.
sentence-next
o-o
That keeps the

business
o-o
ahead of
o-o
copycat
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is this like
o-o
Walt Disney?
sentence-next
o-o
He created
o-o
lots of
o-o
innovations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Excellent
o-o
example.
sentence-next
o-o
In his case his

Without

embezzlement
o-o
there's no leak

ambee sings-desha amenn
And no leak
o-o
of money
o-o
to underpaid
o-o
artists
o-o
at the bottom,
o-o
back before
o-o
they

unionized.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Having
o-o
a source of
o-o
great ideas
o-o
that become

innovations
o-o
can be a

monopoly.

Especially

if competing

don't have

creative

for them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, the

ethical
o-o
kind of

monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe now you can

figure out how

you can make

money from your

invention.
sentence-next
o-o
Maybe by teaming up

with an entrepreneur.
sentence-next
o-o
You would be

the creative

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I could get

a patent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It takes
o-o
lots of money
o-o
to protect
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought
o-o
getting a patent
o-o
was the hard part.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's just a start.
sentence-next
o-o
If it's a
o-o
valuable
o-o
idea
o-o
then other
o-o
businesses
o-o
will infringe on
o-o
your patent.
sentence-next
o-o
So you have to
o-o
take them to court
o-o
to protect your
o-o
monopoly.
sentence-next
o-o
And patent laws
o-o
favor big
o-o
corporations.
sentence-next
o-o
And China
o-o
mostly
o-o
ignores
o-o
patents.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sucks.
sentence-next

Is there a way

to win in

the business

o-o
For someone

like me?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The open patent
o-o
I mentioned
o-o
will help.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If it existed
o-o
you could afford
o-o
to register
o-o
your idea with
o-o
the patent office
o-o
without mortgaging
o-o
your house to pay
o-o
for a patent
o-o
attorney.
sentence-next
o-o
You'd get a
o-o
patent number.
sentence-next
o-o
You'd add it to
o-o
your LinkedIn

profile.
sentence-next
o-o
Then
o-o
corporations
o-o
would compete

to hire you
o-o
to invent
o-o
yet more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
At a big salary!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That path doesn't
o-o
yet exist.
sentence-next
o-o
So what should
o-o
I do?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Currently
o-o
corporations
o-o
don't know how to
o-o
hire, or even
o-o
recognize,
o-o
creative

geniuses.

Yes, alas.

Under current

When that

o-o
that will increase

economic

it will change

Thousands of

But the

o-o
that's not just

different.
sentence-next
o-o
It's also widely
o-o
appreciated
o-o
by millions
o-o
of people.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, that's why
o-o
you use the word
o-o
genius
o-o
after the word
o-o
creative?
sentence-next
o-o
'Cause the word
o-o
creative just
o-o
means different?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
alas,
o-o
most business

managers
o-o
don't understand

the different

meanings of

the word

creative.

And the word

innovation

misunderstood.

The value

of a product

o-o
becomes clear

only in hindsight,

not at the time.

For a fairer

Look at history.

Civilization

Those time wasters
