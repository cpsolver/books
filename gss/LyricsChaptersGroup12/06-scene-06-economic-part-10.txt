also must

be crushed.

This wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
calculation

most of that

gender gap.

Remember,

dentists.

is a
o-o
dishwasher hyphen-here sized
o-o
kitchen
o-o
appliance
o-o
that will do
o-o
food prep using

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Unfortunately
o-o
that's blocked
o-o
because of our
o-o
dysfunctional
o-o
patent system.
sentence-next
o-o
Some kind of
o-o
open patent
o-o

o-o
will help.
o-o

alongside

monopoly
o-o
patent
o-o
system.

fairness and
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
that
o-o
civilization
o-o
is waiting for.
