ambee sings-damien amenn
Brilliant!
sentence-next
o-o
name-desha
o-o
you can put on those
o-o
sunglasses now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Almost.
sentence-next
o-o
The wage gap
o-o
between women
o-o
and men
o-o
also must
o-o
be crushed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
This wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
calculation
o-o
also covers
o-o
most of that
o-o
gender gap.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember,
o-o
a higher
o-o
percentage
o-o
of women
o-o
choose to become
o-o
dental hygienists
o-o
rather than
o-o
dentists.
sentence-next
o-o
And become
o-o
performers
o-o
on Broadway
o-o
rather than
o-o
traders
o-o
on Wall Street.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And public
o-o
school teachers
o-o
rather than
o-o
rich nitwit
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes,
o-o
this fits.
sentence-next
o-o
Finally
o-o
women
o-o
will get a
o-o
long overdue
o-o
pay lift!
sentence-next
o-o
I'm seeing
o-o
a bright
o-o
future now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And I bet
o-o
there would be
o-o
fewer labor
o-o
strikes,
o-o
right?
sentence-next
o-o
That would
o-o
further increase
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You're the one
o-o
who is brilliant
o-o
now.
sentence-next
o-o
Also it will
o-o
better reward
o-o
employees
o-o
who make life
o-o
better for
o-o
customers,
o-o
clients, and
o-o
patients.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead of
o-o
mostly
o-o
increasing
o-o
financial
o-o
income to
o-o
shareholders.
sentence-next
o-o
And owners and
o-o
managers.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus,
o-o
lower hyphen-here paid
o-o
employees
o-o
tend to spend
o-o
more money
o-o
locally.
sentence-next
o-o
Whereas
o-o
higher hyphen-here wage
o-o
managers
o-o
transfer
o-o
more money
o-o
to distant places.
sentence-next
o-o
Like 
o-o
Disneyland,
o-o
Paris,
o-o
cyberspace,
o-o
and
o-o
outer space.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Women
o-o
will spend
o-o
the money less
o-o
selfishly.
sentence-next
o-o
They'll use it
o-o
to benefit
o-o
their family.
sentence-next
o-o
And their
o-o
community.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And their
o-o
favorite
o-o
local
o-o
hair salon.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here's another
o-o
advantage.
sentence-next
o-o
Smaller wage gaps
o-o
will reduce
o-o
the cost of
o-o
government
o-o
handouts.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones
o-o
Republicans
o-o
love to
o-o
complain about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
sentence-next
o-o
Something
o-o
more useful
o-o
than getting named
o-o
employee
o-o
of the month!
sentence-next
o-o
What other
o-o
predictions
o-o
are we failing
o-o
to see?
sentence-next
o-o
What
o-o
solutions
o-o
can solve
o-o
our huge
o-o
crises?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
As you've
o-o
discovered,
o-o
the biggest
o-o
overlooked
o-o
solution
o-o
is pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
So far it's
o-o
not yet been done
o-o
anywhere
o-o
in the states.
sentence-next
o-o
And instant
o-o
runoff voting
o-o
has only been
o-o
adopted for
o-o
Congressional
o-o
elections
o-o
in just a few
o-o
states.
sentence-next
o-o
And not yet for
o-o
any state
o-o
legislatures.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet those are
o-o
the places
o-o
that can adopt
o-o
tax changes.
sentence-next
o-o
When election
o-o
reform is
o-o
done wisely,
o-o
that will end
o-o
the beastly
o-o
feedback
o-o
loop that
o-o
controls
o-o
politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do you have
o-o
a one hyphen-here sentence
o-o
explanation
o-o
for how
o-o
elections
o-o
can be done
o-o
wisely?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Those details
o-o
are part of
o-o
something called
o-o
begin-italics game theory end-italics no-space ,
o-o
which I teach.
sentence-next
o-o
But those details
o-o
are even messier
o-o
than your
o-o
dog poop
o-o
loop.
sentence-next
o-o
name-mathprof
o-o
said you already
o-o
learned
o-o
the basics
o-o
of better
o-o
vote counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In that case,
o-o
what other
o-o
solutions
o-o
are blocked?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And needing a
o-o
revolution!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
An overdue
o-o
innovation
o-o
is a
o-o
dishwasher hyphen-here sized
o-o
kitchen
o-o
appliance
o-o
that will do
o-o
food prep using
o-o
robotics
o-o
controlled by
o-o
artificial
o-o
intelligence
o-o
and remote
o-o
workers
o-o
in distant
o-o
countries.
sentence-next
o-o
In addition to
o-o
washing dishes.
sentence-next
o-o
But that's blocked
o-o
because of our
o-o
dysfunctional
o-o
patent system.
sentence-next
o-o
Some kind of
o-o
open patent
o-o
system
o-o
will help.
o-o
That could exist
o-o
alongside
o-o
our current
o-o
monopoly
o-o
patent
o-o
system.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
o-o
I'd rather have that
o-o
kitchen prep
o-o
machine
o-o
than a self hyphen-here driving
o-o
car.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Me too!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Also
o-o
I've read about
o-o
fully
o-o
synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon
o-o
fuel,
o-o
thorium
o-o
nuclear
o-o
reactors,
o-o
a fully
o-o
phonetic
o-o
writing system
o-o
that will reduce
o-o
illiteracy,
o-o
new programming
o-o
languages
o-o
that will
o-o
simplify
o-o
automating
o-o
things online,
o-o
and a
o-o
years hyphen-here in hyphen-here prison
o-o
movie and game
o-o
rating that
o-o
will reduce crime.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus I've got
o-o
a personal
o-o
guess.
sentence-next
o-o
There will be
o-o
better
o-o
micro hyphen-here payment
o-o
systems that help
o-o
individual
o-o
entrepreneurs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
It makes my
o-o
gutter cleaning
o-o
tool seem
o-o
smaller than
o-o
a bikini
o-o
on a beach
o-o
in Rio.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
How do you know
o-o
about these things?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I've seen some
o-o
movies about
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
oh.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I read.
sentence-next
o-o
It's a form of
o-o
time travel.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I read too,
o-o
but this is all
o-o
news to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I mostly read
o-o
non hyphen-here fiction.
sentence-next
o-o
I skip over
o-o
articles that
o-o
are judgments,
o-o
such as who's to blame,
o-o
or what begin-italics should end-italics be done,
o-o
or what celebrities
o-o
are promoting.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead I like
o-o
to read about
o-o
why things are
o-o
the way they are.
sentence-next
o-o
That includes
o-o
lots of
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
And when there's
o-o
a claim for a
o-o
solution,
o-o
I just focus
o-o
on its
o-o
advantages
o-o
and
o-o
disadvantages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's blocking
o-o
those future
o-o
solutions from
o-o
happening?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Let me guess.
sentence-next
o-o
Feedback loops.
sentence-next
o-o
Bad ones.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus again!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So there's lots
o-o
of feedback loops
o-o
blocking progress.
sentence-next
o-o
What's the
o-o
feedback loop
o-o
that blocks us
o-o
from election
o-o
reform?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are many.
sentence-next
o-o
As you've discovered,
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is just one part
o-o
of a bad
o-o
feedback loop
o-o
that keeps owners
o-o
of many big
o-o
businesses
o-o
in political power.
sentence-next
o-o
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I think I see.
sentence-next
o-o
It's vote
o-o
splitting
o-o
in general
o-o
elections
o-o
that causes
o-o
political
o-o
parties
o-o
to only offer
o-o
one nominee
o-o
in each party.
sentence-next
o-o
And having
o-o
just one
o-o
nominee
o-o
per party
o-o
allows
o-o
the blocking tactic,
o-o
like when
o-o
Republicans
o-o
gave money
o-o
to Obama
o-o
to block
o-o
Hillary
o-o
Clinton
o-o
from reaching
o-o
the 2008
o-o
presidential
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
And vote
o-o
splitting
o-o
in primary
o-o
elections
o-o
allows money
o-o
to control
o-o
who wins
o-o
the party's
o-o
nomination.
sentence-next
o-o
And it blocks
o-o
third parties
o-o
from getting
o-o
meaningful support.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
that's what
o-o
allows
o-o
corrupt
o-o
business owners
o-o
to limit
o-o
our choice to
o-o
one Republican
o-o
puppet
o-o
and one
o-o
Democratic
o-o
puppet
o-o
in our
o-o
general
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
So it's that bad
o-o
feedback loop
o-o
that's our
o-o
evil
o-o
enemy?
sentence-next
o-o
And why Congress
o-o
follows
o-o
the motto
o-o
begin-italics Keep Congress Weird end-italics no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That sounds like
o-o
a good
o-o
summary
o-o
to me.
end-lyric
