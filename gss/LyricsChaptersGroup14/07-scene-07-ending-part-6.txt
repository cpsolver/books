Who would have won?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We don't know
o-o
because even
o-o
opinion polls
o-o
don't ask voters
o-o
for more than
o-o
their favorite.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
But Trump won the
o-o
general
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
That proves he
o-o
was more popular
o-o
than Hillary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
With ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting
o-o
there would have been
o-o
a second
o-o
Republican and
o-o
a second
o-o
Democrat
o-o
to win against.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Plus Bernie Sanders
o-o
running as an

independent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Trump could not
o-o
have won such a
o-o
five hyphen-here way race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that if we used
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting,
o-o
then voters would have
o-o
more choices on
o-o
the ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Even better than
o-o
more choices, the
o-o
choices would
o-o
include wise
o-o
problem hyphen-here solving
o-o
leaders.
sentence-next
o-o
Now the only
o-o
choices are
o-o
special hyphen-here interest

puppets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Under current
o-o
conditions,
o-o
wise and
o-o
ethical
o-o
leaders
o-o
don't enter
o-o
elections
o-o
because they know
o-o
they won't get
o-o
support from
o-o
party
o-o
insiders,
o-o
who have to
o-o
cater to
o-o
people like you,
o-o
with lots of
o-o
money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
These so hyphen-here called wise
o-o
leaders,
o-o
would they be liberal
o-o
or conservative?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Neither.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They would represent
o-o
the political up,
o-o
and would oppose
o-o
the political down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So they're
o-o
anti hyphen-here business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They would favor
o-o
fairness and
o-o
economic
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
er,
o-o
efficiency
o-o
in the
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
That would bring
o-o
prosperity
o-o
much greater than
o-o
what we have today.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Prosperity to who?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Widespread prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
That's impossible!
sentence-next
o-o
In order to have
o-o
winners there must be
o-o
losers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's what I used
o-o
to think. But
o-o
fighting wastes
o-o
precious resources.
sentence-next
o-o
What yields better
o-o
results for the
o-o
most people is
o-o
cooperation,
o-o
teamwork, and
o-o
working together
o-o
against a foe.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I like this shift.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Did you just curse?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Not everyone
o-o
can afford to fly
o-o
to London and

Paris. I agree
o-o
with father that
o-o
for there to be
o-o
winners there have
o-o
to be losers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You want to fly

to London and Paris?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
I've told you I
o-o
enjoy traveling.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought you meant
o-o
mostly by car.
sentence-next
o-o
And only going
o-o
to Europe
o-o
when we can
o-o
afford it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Back to the idea
o-o
of no losers.
sentence-next
o-o
Surely some folks
o-o
would lose out
o-o
economically
o-o
if elections
o-o
were more fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
There are some
o-o
businesses
o-o
that exploit
o-o
begin-italics unfairness end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
They would have
o-o
less profit
o-o
because of
o-o
higher taxes.
sentence-next
o-o
And because of
o-o
fewer
o-o
monopolies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Such as?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You taught me
o-o
about
o-o
commodities
o-o
so you know
o-o
there's two kinds
o-o
of sugar there.
sentence-next
o-o
I forgot
o-o
the numbers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You must mean
o-o
sugar number
o-o
eleven
o-o
and sugar
o-o
number
o-o
sixteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The higher price
o-o
is the one
o-o
in the U.S.
sentence-next
o-o
The rest of the
o-o
world pays
o-o
the lower price.
sentence-next
o-o
The people
o-o
in Florida
o-o
who exploit
o-o
that legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
would lose income.
sentence-next
o-o
But all of us
o-o
in the U.S.
o-o
would pay less
o-o
for sugar
o-o
and sugarized
o-o
products.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Hmm,
o-o
you're right.
sentence-next
o-o
I knew I was
o-o
subsidizing
o-o
some business
o-o
owners in
o-o
Florida.
sentence-next
o-o
But I wasn't
o-o
bothered.
sentence-next
o-o
That extra cost
o-o
for sugar
o-o
is tiny.
sentence-next
o-o
Even for me,
o-o
who isn't.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Each price squeeze,
o-o
considered
o-o
one at a time,
o-o
isn't
o-o
a big deal.
sentence-next
o-o
But those price hikes
o-o
surround us.
sentence-next
o-o
That's a big steal
o-o
from those of us
o-o
who can barely
o-o
afford rent
o-o
and food and
o-o
utilities.
sentence-next
o-o
And then
o-o
businesses
o-o
wonder why
o-o
we aren't buying
o-o
more of
o-o
what they sell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In addition
o-o
to ending
o-o
outright
o-o
corruption,
o-o
there would be
o-o
tax breaks
o-o
for some kinds
o-o
of businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Which businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Businesses
o-o
that bring money
o-o
into the
o-o
region
o-o
from customers
o-o
outside
o-o
the region.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course
o-o
that includes
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
Also it can
o-o
be businesses
o-o
that involve
o-o
software,
o-o
artists,
o-o
and
o-o
entertainment.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus non hyphen-here chain
o-o
restaurants.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Tax breaks
o-o
already go to
o-o
businesses
o-o
like that.
sentence-next
o-o
You mean Apple,
o-o
Boeing,
o-o
Disney,
o-o
General Motors,
o-o
Intel,
o-o
Nike,
o-o
Hollywood
o-o
movie studios,
o-o
and such,
o-o
right?
sentence-next
o-o
Why should
o-o
they get more?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This new tax break
o-o
will be for
o-o
similar
o-o
businesses
o-o
that are small.
sentence-next
o-o
They're too small
o-o
to sell shares
o-o
on Wall Street.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet there are
o-o
thousands
o-o
of them
o-o
in our city.
sentence-next
o-o
Collectively
o-o
they greatly
o-o
enrich
o-o
our local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You said non hyphen-here chain
o-o
restaurants.
sentence-next
o-o
Why not chain
o-o
restaurants?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Chain businesses
o-o
send lots of
o-o
their profits
o-o
to corporate
o-o
headquarters.
sentence-next
o-o
That drains
o-o
money from
o-o
the local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And nobody
o-o
chooses a city
o-o
as their travel
o-o
destination
o-o
because
o-o
they look forward
o-o
to dining out
o-o
at a
o-o
Burger King
o-o
franchise
o-o
location.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I often sell
o-o
condos
o-o
and homes
o-o
to people from

elsewhere.
sentence-next
o-o
That brings
o-o
lots of wealth
o-o
into our local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That brings
o-o
money to you.
sentence-next
o-o
But it increases
o-o
traffic.
sentence-next
o-o
And reduces
o-o
the land
o-o
available
o-o
for homes
o-o
that are more
o-o
affordable,
o-o
which is what
o-o
we need more of.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Pushing up
o-o
the cost of
o-o
housing
o-o
pushes
o-o
more and more
o-o
people into
o-o
homelessness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Oh, I think I'm
o-o
beginning
o-o
to see.
sentence-next
o-o
We could
o-o
reduce taxes
o-o
on activities
o-o
that enrich the
o-o
local
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
Without giving
o-o
yet more tax breaks
o-o
to businesses
o-o
that do
o-o
activities that
o-o
drain the
o-o
local economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Exactly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
So it taxes the sinners
o-o
and helps the saints?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a useful
o-o
way to view it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I like it!
sentence-next
o-o
Even though
o-o
it might offend
o-o
many of the
o-o
folks who need
o-o
religion
o-o
the most.
sentence-next
o-o
Like lawyers,
o-o
bankers, and

CFOs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aliens?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not UFOs.
sentence-next
o-o
CFOs.
sentence-next
o-o
Chief

Father takes

the saying

Our church

o-o
Well,

aliens.
sentence-next
o-o
The space kind.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
The aliens
o-o
crossing from

Mexico
o-o
certainly

don't deserve

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I suppose

you would have

sentence-next
o-o
They arrived as

immigrants.
end-lyric

Things would have

end-lyric

You'd be

living in a

doubly dark
o-o
dark age.
sentence-next
o-o
Anyway,
o-o
the
o-o
different
o-o
tax rates are
o-o
like the

difference

between a

word-resume

sentence-next
o-o
A word-resume

A eulogy
