ambee sings-vc amenn
Interesting
o-o
distinction!
sentence-next
o-o
What I've accomplished
o-o
would look fabulous
o-o
on a word-resume no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
But now it's time
o-o
to consider what
o-o
might be said
o-o
in my eulogy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I don't see the
o-o
difference.
sentence-next
o-o
But then religion
o-o
isn't my thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Clearly money
o-o
is your thing.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet your
o-o
begin-italics taker end-italics
o-o
business
o-o
will earn
o-o
more money
o-o
when there are more
o-o
begin-italics maker end-italics
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A taker
o-o
business is the
o-o
sinning kind,
o-o
and a maker
o-o
business is
o-o
the saintly kind.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
My business
o-o
makes buildings.
sentence-next
o-o
Clearly
o-o
it deserves
o-o
that maker
o-o
tax break.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your business
o-o
pays architects
o-o
and contractors
o-o
to actually
o-o
do the making.
sentence-next
o-o
Those businesses
o-o
are the maker
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
Your business
o-o
is just a
o-o
taker business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I disagree.
sentence-next
o-o
Anyway,
o-o
why would my
o-o
business
o-o
benefit from
o-o
more maker
o-o
businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Maker businesses
o-o
not only bring
o-o
money into
o-o
a city or state.
sentence-next
o-o
Also they pass
o-o
lots of that
o-o
outside money
o-o
to their
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
Those employees
o-o
are customers
o-o
of other local
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
Some of that wealth
o-o
quickly reaches
o-o
your customers.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones who
o-o
buy or rent
o-o
from your business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Imagine
o-o
an economic
o-o
apocalypse.
sentence-next
o-o
If there were no
o-o
maker businesses
o-o
in our state,
o-o
no money would
o-o
enter our state.
sentence-next
o-o
Then our state's
o-o
economy
o-o
would collapse.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
o-o
It's like
o-o
trickle down
o-o
economics.
sentence-next
o-o
But instead of
o-o
telling folks
o-o
our money will
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to them,
o-o
the money
o-o
flowing into
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
really does
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to local
o-o
business owners
o-o
and their
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
I had failed
o-o
to see that
o-o
begin-italics small end-italics maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
also should be
o-o
getting
o-o
tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
So they are like
o-o
the bottom
o-o
level of a
o-o
pyramid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Pointless?
sentence-next
o-o
My time is
o-o
valuable
o-o
so please
o-o
get to the point.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
It sounds to me
o-o
like maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
of all sizes,
o-o
are the
o-o
foundation
o-o
of the local
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
All other
o-o
businesses
o-o
are supported
o-o
by their
o-o
success?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a good
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Right now
o-o
the pyramid
o-o
is upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of taker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
big and small,
o-o
get low tax burdens.
sentence-next
o-o
That crushes
o-o
lots of small
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
They crumble
o-o
under
o-o
the burden of
o-o
the highest
o-o
tax rates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
the same
o-o
tax rates as
o-o
law firms,
o-o
insurance
o-o
agencies,
o-o
and franchise
o-o
places.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Some bad symptoms
o-o
of that burden
o-o
include
o-o
unemployment,
o-o
homelessness,
o-o
drug abuse,
o-o
and crime.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Also
o-o
anger,
o-o
despair,
o-o
hopelessness,
o-o
and higher
o-o
interest rates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if you
o-o
don't want
o-o
a low hyphen-here wage
o-o
employee
o-o
in a tiny
o-o
studio
o-o
apartment to
o-o
get forced into
o-o
homelessness,
o-o
then into drugs,
o-o
then into crime,
o-o
then into despair,
o-o
now is the time
o-o
to prevent it.
sentence-next
o-o
By caring
o-o
about not just
o-o
begin-italics big end-italics maker
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
begin-italics Small end-italics maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
all together,
o-o
attract huge
o-o
amounts of
o-o
money into
o-o
the local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Another
o-o
benefit of
o-o
taxing takers
o-o
more than makers
o-o
is that very smart
o-o
well hyphen-here educated
o-o
people would be less
o-o
attracted to
o-o
higher paid,
o-o
but soul hyphen-here sucking,
o-o
jobs in
o-o
banks.
sentence-next
o-o
And law firms.
sentence-next
o-o
And in
o-o
real estate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Instead they would
o-o
work where they
o-o
benefit customers,
o-o
and clients,
o-o
and the overall
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Well said!
sentence-next
o-o
And to the teaching
o-o
profession, which
o-o
could use the very
o-o
best role models
o-o
for students.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what Willie
o-o
does. She's a
o-o
teacher.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So who's going to
o-o
believe this nonsense
o-o
that different ballots
o-o
and different ways
o-o
of counting votes
o-o
is really going
o-o
to make things better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This
o-o
situation
o-o
is like when
o-o
women
o-o
demanded
o-o
the right
o-o
to vote.
sentence-next
o-o
A few places,
o-o
like Canada,
o-o
Australia,
o-o
and
o-o
New Zealand,
o-o
tried it.
sentence-next
o-o
Then a few western
o-o
states tried it.
sentence-next
o-o
The predicted
o-o
disasters
o-o
didn't follow,
o-o
so it was
o-o
adopted
o-o
throughout the
o-o
United States.
sentence-next
o-o
And don't you think
o-o
it's made things
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Sometimes
o-o
I wonder.
sentence-next
o-o
We don't seem to be
o-o
doing that well
o-o
now that women
o-o
have
o-o
taken over.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Without Rosie
o-o
the riveters
o-o
working in
o-o
factories
o-o
during the war years
o-o
U.S. soldiers
o-o
and England
o-o
might have lost.
sentence-next
o-o
And a woman in
o-o
the White House
o-o
couldn't possibly
o-o
disgrace
o-o
the place
o-o
worse than
o-o
the males
o-o
who have
o-o
infested it with
o-o
dog bites,
o-o
cat fights,
o-o
mistresses,
o-o
drugs,
o-o
military
o-o
ineptitude,
o-o
and
o-o
insurrection.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Getting back to
o-o
makers and
o-o
takers.
sentence-next
o-o
name-vc
o-o
do you see
o-o
that tax breaks
o-o
for small maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
will increase sales
o-o
at taker
o-o
businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I admit I do.
sentence-next
o-o
I hadn't
o-o
noticed this
o-o
distinction.
sentence-next
o-o
I can see
o-o
those small maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
including
o-o
restaurants
o-o
that attract
o-o
tourists,
o-o
don't have time
o-o
to lobby for
o-o
these tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Tell him about
o-o
the wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
tax break.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another
o-o
kind of tax break
o-o
will reward
o-o
a business
o-o
that pays their
o-o
workers better.
sentence-next
The ones who get
o-o
lower wages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That gap
o-o
gets smaller
o-o
by increasing
o-o
the wages of
o-o
employees
o-o
at the bottom
o-o
of the business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You want me
o-o
to tighten my belt,
o-o
not just on me,
o-o
but on my business.
sentence-next
o-o
Yeah I've gotten
o-o
to be too fat.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why
o-o
I'm here.
sentence-next
o-o
Maybe my
o-o
businesses
o-o
also would be
o-o
healthier
o-o
if I shared
o-o
some of my income
o-o
with all my
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
Not just the ones
o-o
in management.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And pardon
o-o
my boldness
o-o
but maybe that
o-o
will make it
o-o
easier to hire
o-o
and retain
o-o
the best 
o-o
employees.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The ones who do
o-o
the work
o-o
your customers
o-o
write about
o-o
on social
o-o
media.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That might lessen
o-o
the load on
o-o
management.
sentence-next
o-o
After all,
o-o
better paid
o-o
employees
o-o
need fewer
o-o
incentives
o-o
and fewer rules.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And fewer
o-o
verbal spankings
o-o
from the human
o-o
resources
o-o
department.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Don't get any
o-o
socialistic
o-o
notions about
o-o
telling me
o-o
to pay my
o-o
employees more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If you choose
o-o
contractors
o-o
who do it,
o-o
that will reduce
o-o
taxpayer hyphen-here supported

food hyphen-here assistance

handouts.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones that
o-o
people like you
o-o

about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Hmm,
o-o
this seems
o-o
to relate to
o-o
what you said
o-o
earlier
o-o
Father,
o-o
I mean name-minister no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
You said shortcuts
o-o
to earn
o-o
more money

increase

for others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Churches now
o-o
provide hot meals

o-o
to those who
o-o
cannot afford
o-o
the basics.
sentence-next
o-o
When they can get
o-o
better hyphen-here paying jobs
o-o
we won't need to
o-o
offer as much
o-o
assistance
o-o
to the needy.
sentence-next
o-o
So this is yet
o-o
another way
o-o
churches might lose
o-o
even more of
o-o
our influence.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I'm in favor
o-o
of this reform!
sentence-next
o-o
People with jobs
o-o
surely deserve
o-o
basic healthcare,
o-o
staying warm,
o-o
some hot meals,
o-o
and a stuffed
o-o
toy for a child.
sentence-next
o-o
