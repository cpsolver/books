ambee sings-fiance amenn
You've told me
o-o
some of what
o-o
you've learned,
o-o
but you haven't
o-o
yet said who's
o-o
to blame for
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm the one
o-o
to blame.
sentence-next
o-o
It's not
o-o
politicians,
o-o
not the big
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors,
o-o
not the
o-o
lobbyists
o-o
and other folks
o-o
who are hired to do
o-o
political tasks.
sentence-next
o-o
What I thought
o-o
might be
o-o
conspiracy
o-o
turns out to be
o-o
bad feedback loops
o-o
in which each
o-o
person
o-o
independently
o-o
pursues their own
o-o
self hyphen-here interest.
sentence-next
o-o
The biggest
o-o
baddest
o-o
feedback loop
o-o
is in elections
o-o
where I'm
o-o
the weak link.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm the one
o-o
to blame.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
How can you be
o-o
the one to blame?
sentence-next
o-o
You haven't done
o-o
anything.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
I failed.
sentence-next
o-o
I failed to subtract
o-o
forty from
o-o
one hundred
o-o
and realize
o-o
the result,
o-o
sixty,
o-o
is more than
o-o
fifty.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
You said math was
o-o
made by the
o-o
devil.
sentence-next
o-o
When he was in
o-o
a snit.
sentence-next
o-o
And now you're
o-o
talking math?
sentence-next
o-o
This doesn't fit.
sentence-next
o-o
Not one bit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My fear of math
o-o
was blocking me.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I know that
o-o
a candidate
o-o
who gets forty
o-o
percent support
o-o
is opposed by sixty
o-o
percent of voters.
sentence-next
o-o
That means the
o-o
majority of voters
o-o
oppose a candidate
o-o
who has less than
o-o
fifty percent
o-o
support.
sentence-next
o-o
To get fair
o-o
election
o-o
results
o-o
we need
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
What does counting
o-o
smart rabbits
o-o
have to do
o-o
with voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Father it's not
o-o
begin-italics wise hare end-italics
o-o
counting.
sentence-next
o-o
It's pairwise
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Without
o-o
pairwise counting
o-o
and ranked choice
o-o
ballots,
o-o
corruption in
o-o
Congress
o-o
will continue.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When a news report
o-o
says one candidate
o-o
leads another by
o-o
say five percent,
o-o
that's meaningless,
o-o
unless there are
o-o
just two candidates
o-o
on the ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Hello name-damien no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh hi name-vc no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
I didn't recognize
o-o
you with the
o-o
tubing mustache.
sentence-next
o-o
Is this a good time
o-o
to thank you for
o-o
helping me
o-o
figure out how
o-o
the world of
o-o
business works?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I was happy to help.
sentence-next
o-o
name-father-of-fiance said you
o-o
deserved some help.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
What did you say
o-o
to this ungrateful
o-o
young man?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As you requested
o-o
I told him how
o-o
the world of
o-o
business works.
sentence-next
o-o
He had some
o-o
questions about
o-o
money in
o-o
politics that
o-o
I couldn't
o-o
answer so I
o-o
referred him
o-o
to a politician
o-o
I know.
sentence-next
o-o
How did that go?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
He taught me a lot.
sentence-next
o-o
Then later,
o-o
he suggested
o-o
that name-desha
o-o
and I meet
o-o
and collaborate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What was his
o-o
great wisdom?
sentence-next
o-o
In a nutshell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
He explained that
o-o
vote splitting is
o-o
why money has more
o-o
influence than votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Goats do not spit.
sentence-next
o-o
You fool.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Father, it's not
o-o
goat spitting, it's
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Whatever!
sentence-next
o-o
Votes are counted
o-o
in ways that are fair.
sentence-next
o-o
So that's got not
o-o
a thing to do with
o-o
money in politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I used to think that too.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
When you donate
o-o
money to political
o-o
candidates,
o-o
sometimes you give
o-o
to Democrats.
sentence-next
o-o
Am I right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Never!
sentence-next
o-o
I always vote
o-o
Republican.
sentence-next
o-o
And I never give
o-o
money to Democrats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
But mother is a
o-o
Democrat.
sentence-next
o-o
And sometimes you
o-o
give her money
o-o
to donate to
o-o
a Democratic
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
That's only when
o-o
my political
o-o
consultant
o-o
tells me to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So when Barack
o-o
Obama and
o-o
Hillary Clinton ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Those are vile names
o-o
to me and my friends.
sentence-next
o-o
Isn't that right
o-o
name-vc no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Let him continue.
sentence-next
o-o
This is interesting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Some political
o-o
strategists
o-o
recommended
o-o
that Republicans
o-o
give money to
o-o
Obama during
o-o
the Democratic
o-o
primary.
sentence-next
o-o
They expected
o-o
that a black man
o-o
could not
o-o
possibly win
o-o
the general
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
With that strategy
o-o
they figured
o-o
a Republican
o-o
would win
o-o
easily.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
You can't prove
o-o
any of this.
sentence-next
o-o
And without proof
o-o
there's no crime.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I also learned
o-o
that the fight
o-o
between
o-o
political
o-o
left and right
o-o
is an
o-o
entertaining
o-o
distraction
o-o
from the
o-o
bigger fight
o-o
between
o-o
political up
o-o
and
o-o
political down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
You're talking
o-o
more nonsense.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Who is the
o-o
political up?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Most of us voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
And who is the
o-o
political down?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The people who
o-o
give the biggest
o-o
amounts of money
o-o
to politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That includes
o-o
you sir.
sentence-next
o-o
And especially
o-o
you for your
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributions
o-o
to city hyphen-here council
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Oh dear lord,
o-o
my own daughter
o-o
is undermining
o-o
my church.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
She's your daughter?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Amen.
sentence-next
o-o
I mean,
o-o
indeed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Why do you think
o-o
I call him father?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
We're all
o-o
calling him
o-o
Father.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This explains why
o-o
I don't hear her
o-o
use profanity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Father is very
o-o
strict about that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since I'm not in
o-o
your church,
o-o
what should I call you?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
You can call me
o-o
name-minister no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
name-minister no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
It's short for
o-o
Whittier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Who are you
o-o
wittier than?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
It's spelled
o-o
W H I T.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So in grade school
o-o
they called you
o-o
dimwit?
sentence-next
o-o
And half hyphen-here wit?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
At that age
o-o
those nicknames
o-o
helped me learn to
o-o
identify
o-o
immaturity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
name-damien no-space ,
o-o
you were saying
o-o
something about
o-o
political up
o-o
and political down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Vote splitting
o-o
is the reason
o-o
money
o-o
so easily
o-o
influences
o-o
politics.
sentence-next
o-o
In the early days
o-o
of the U.S.
o-o
there were no
o-o
primary
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
Slowly voters
o-o
and parties learned
o-o
that whichever
o-o
party had just one
o-o
candidate would
o-o
easily win over
o-o
parties that had
o-o
two or more
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So primary elections
o-o
were added to ensure
o-o
each party offered
o-o
just one candidate
o-o
in what we now
o-o
call general
o-o
elections.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
And the point is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If we used
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
vote counting,
o-o
then Democrats
o-o
could have
o-o
offered both
o-o
Obama
o-o
and Clinton
o-o
as candidates
o-o
in the two
o-o
thousand eight
o-o
presidential
o-o
race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Oh,
o-o
so the tactic
o-o
of using Obama
o-o
to block Clinton
o-o
wouldn't have been
o-o
an option.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And wealthy folks
o-o
like yourselves
o-o
would not have been
o-o
able to stop
o-o
Clinton from
o-o
reaching the
o-o
general
o-o
election.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
This is all nonsense!
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's making sense
o-o
to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Who's side are you on?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I am now on
o-o
the side of God.
sentence-next
o-o
My heart attack
o-o
has woken me up
o-o
to what's really
o-o
important in life.
sentence-next
o-o
And at the moment
o-o
I want the truth
o-o
to come out.
sentence-next
o-o
If there are hidden
o-o
parts of politics
o-o
that get revealed
o-o
here we can judge
o-o
it at that time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I suppose you're
o-o
going to claim that
o-o
Donald Trump
o-o
won in twenty sixteen
o-o
because of money.
sentence-next
o-o
Well he didn't.
sentence-next
o-o
I didn't give him
o-o
even a dollar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But you do give
o-o
to the
o-o
Republican
o-o
party,
o-o
and they paid to
o-o
promote Trump
o-o
after he won the
o-o
primary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If the
o-o
twenty sixteen
o-o
Republican
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
election
o-o
had used ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
and pairwise counting,
o-o
the winner would
o-o
have been the most
o-o
popular candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
And that was not
o-o
Donald Trump.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
There were sixteen
o-o
other
o-o
candidates
o-o
in that race.
sentence-next
o-o
That split the votes
o-o
of the
o-o
majority
o-o
of
o-o
Republicans.
sentence-next
o-o
They wanted
o-o
someone other
o-o
than Trump.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
All Trump and his
o-o
promoters,
o-o
including
o-o
Russian hackers,
o-o
needed was to
o-o
win more votes
o-o
than any one of
o-o
the other sixteen
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
None of whom were
o-o
very popular.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Until the other
o-o
candidates
o-o
dropped out,
o-o
Trump was getting
o-o
less than half
o-o
the votes.
sentence-next
o-o
And that's just
o-o
Republicans.
sentence-next
o-o
He would have lost
o-o
under a fairer
o-o
election.
end-lyric
