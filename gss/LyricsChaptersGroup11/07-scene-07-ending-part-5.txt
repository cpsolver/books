So who's going to
o-o
believe this nonsense
o-o
that different ballots
o-o
and different ways
o-o
of counting votes
o-o
is really going
o-o
to make things better?
end-lyric

This situation

o-o
A few places,
o-o
like Canada,
o-o
Australia, and
o-o
New Zealand,
o-o
tried it.
sentence-next
o-o
Then a few western
o-o
states tried it.
sentence-next
o-o
The predicted

disasters didn't
o-o
follow,
o-o
so it was
o-o
adopted
o-o
throughout the
o-o
United States.
sentence-next
o-o
And don't you think
o-o
it's made things better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Sometimes I wonder.
sentence-next
o-o
We don't seem to be
o-o
doing that well now
o-o
that women have

taken over.

the riveters

U.S. soldiers

sentence-next
o-o
And a woman in

the White House
o-o
couldn't possibly

disgrace
o-o
the place

Getting back to
o-o
makers and
o-o
takers,
o-o
name-vc
o-o
do you see
o-o
that tax breaks
o-o
for small maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
will increase sales
o-o
at taker

businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I admit I do.
o-o
I hadn't
o-o
noticed this
o-o
distinction.
sentence-next
o-o
I can see
o-o
those small maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
including
o-o
restaurants
o-o
that attract
o-o
tourists,
o-o
don't have time
o-o
to lobby for
o-o
these tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Tell him about
o-o
the wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
tax break.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
An additional
o-o
tax break
o-o
would go to
o-o
businesses
o-o
that pay their
o-o
workers better.
sentence-next
o-o
It's measured
o-o
as the gap
o-o
in wages
o-o
between the
o-o
better hyphen-here paid
o-o
employees
o-o
and the
o-o
other half
o-o
of the
o-o
employees.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That gap
o-o
gets smaller
o-o
by increasing
o-o
the wages of
o-o
employees
o-o
at the bottom
o-o
of the business.
end-lyric

You want me

sentence-next
o-o
Yeah I've gotten
o-o
to be too fat,
o-o
which is why
o-o
I'm here.
sentence-next
o-o
Maybe my

business
o-o
also would be

healthier
o-o
if I shared
o-o
some of my income
o-o
with all my
o-o
employees,
o-o
not just the ones
o-o
in management.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And pardon
o-o
my boldness
o-o
but maybe that

will make it
o-o
easier to hire

and retain
o-o
the best

employees.

the work

your customers

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That might lessen
o-o
the load on
o-o
management.
sentence-next
o-o
After all,
o-o
better paid
o-o
employees
o-o
need fewer
o-o
incentives
o-o
and fewer rules.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And fewer
o-o
verbal spankings
o-o
from the human
o-o
resources

department.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Don't get any

socialistic

notions about

telling me

to pay my

employees more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not that I care
o-o
about income
o-o
for your business,
o-o
but a wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
tax break
o-o
might reduce
o-o
the taxes
o-o
your business
o-o
pays.
sentence-next
o-o
And it would
o-o
reduce the need
o-o
for the
o-o
taxpayer hyphen-here supported
o-o
food hyphen-here assistance
o-o
handouts
o-o
you complain
o-o
about.
end-lyric

Hmm,

this seems

You said shortcuts

Churches now
o-o
provide hot meals

to those who
o-o
cannot afford
o-o
the basics.
sentence-next
o-o
When they can get
o-o
better hyphen-here paying jobs
o-o
we won't need to
o-o
offer as much
o-o
assistance
o-o
to the needy.
sentence-next
o-o
So this is yet
o-o
another way
o-o
churches might lose
o-o
even more of
o-o
our influence.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I'm in favor
o-o
of this reform!
sentence-next
o-o
People with jobs
o-o
surely deserve
o-o
hot meals,

staying warm,

and basic

healthcare
o-o
without assistance
o-o
from churches
o-o
or government.

Plus,
o-o
more of the money

Remember
o-o
women tend
o-o
to choose jobs
o-o
where they can help
o-o
children,
o-o
nurse folks
o-o
to better health,
o-o
help
o-o
customers,
o-o
and
o-o
sell toy

dinosaurs.
sentence-next
o-o
Currently
o-o
those jobs pay less.
sentence-next
o-o
When those women
o-o
earn more,
o-o
they'll spend
o-o
more of it
o-o
doing good things
o-o
for their family
o-o
and the
o-o
community.
sentence-next
That's way better
o-o
than managers
o-o
and executives
o-o
buying bigger 
o-o
fishing boats,
o-o
and buying
o-o
stupid lingerie
o-o
as if that
o-o
compensates
o-o
for their failure
o-o
to understand
o-o
what wives want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And there will be

fewer strikes

what's that called,

something like

guaranteed income?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Universal basic income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Finally
o-o
we agree

on something.
sentence-next
o-o
That idea doesn't

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it wouldn't
o-o
be getting
o-o
attention
o-o
if business
o-o
owners reduced
o-o
the wage gap.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember
o-o
capitalism
o-o
is about supply
o-o
and demand.
sentence-next
o-o
When you supply
o-o
better hyphen-here paying jobs
o-o
there will be lots
o-o
of demand
o-o
for those jobs
o-o
so you'll get
o-o
better hyphen-here qualified
o-o
applicants.
sentence-next

In other words

tax credits can

So is fairness

Why can't we
