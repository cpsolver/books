ambee sings-econhist amenn
First,
o-o
do you see
o-o
that voting,
o-o
and laws,
o-o
and taxes,
o-o
and jail time,
o-o
are all forms of
o-o
communication?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
As voters,
o-o
we try to
o-o
express
o-o
our desire
o-o
to drain
o-o
DC's swampy
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
But with
o-o
plurality
o-o
voting,
o-o
politicians
o-o
are deaf.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Except to the
o-o
ka hyphen-here ching
o-o
sound
o-o
of campaign
o-o
contributions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
As for tax breaks,
o-o
they try to
o-o
lure us into
o-o
getting married,
o-o
raising children,
o-o
and buying
o-o
a farm.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And Wall Street
o-o
employees
o-o
never going
o-o
to jail
o-o
attracts
o-o
job applicants
o-o
who aspire to
o-o
thievery.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the
o-o
general idea.
sentence-next
o-o
Now consider
o-o
that already
o-o
a city
o-o
government,
o-o
or state
o-o
government,
o-o
gives a tax break
o-o
to a big new
o-o
factory
o-o
that moves to,
o-o
or stays in,
o-o
their city
o-o
or state.
sentence-next
o-o
However,
o-o
usually,
o-o
small
o-o
non hyphen-here factory
o-o
businesses
o-o
don't get those
o-o
special
o-o
tax breaks.
sentence-next
o-o
Not even if they
o-o
make something
o-o
valuable
o-o
and sell it to
o-o
customers
o-o
around the world.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet if those small
o-o
businesses
o-o
got a good
o-o
tax break,
o-o
that would
o-o
motivate
o-o
more of
o-o
those kinds of
o-o
businesses
o-o
to grow and be
o-o
created.
sentence-next
o-o
The result
o-o
would be
o-o
more money
o-o
coming into
o-o
that city
o-o
or state.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why don't cities
o-o
and states
o-o
give those
o-o
tax breaks?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Under our current
o-o
election system,
o-o
lobbyists
o-o
and big
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
would insist on
o-o
giving those
o-o
tax breaks to the
o-o
opposite
o-o
kind of
o-o
business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the
o-o
opposite?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's call the
o-o
two extreme
o-o
kinds of
o-o
businesses
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
and taker
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I presume
o-o
people like me
o-o
who make things
o-o
work for maker
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And the taker
o-o
businesses
o-o
include
o-o
law firms,
o-o
credit card
o-o
companies,
o-o
and timber
o-o
harvesters.
sentence-next
o-o
Right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
The map
o-o
that goes from
o-o
makers
o-o
to takers
o-o
starts with
o-o
farming and ranching.
sentence-next
o-o
They already
o-o
get tax breaks,
o-o
regardless
o-o
of size.
sentence-next
o-o
The other
o-o
main maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
include
o-o
manufacturing,
o-o
construction,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
inventing,
o-o
software developing,
o-o
cooking,
o-o
and
o-o
entertaining.
sentence-next
o-o
Only some of them
o-o
get tax breaks.
sentence-next
o-o
There are lots
o-o
of intermediate
o-o
categories
o-o
such as teaching,
o-o
healthcare,
o-o
maintenance,
o-o
transportation,
o-o
retail,
o-o
hospitality,
o-o
and
o-o
marketing.
sentence-next
o-o
At the full
o-o
taker end
o-o
there's
o-o
banking,
o-o
insurance,
o-o
legal services,
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers,
o-o
logging,
o-o
mining,
o-o
casinos,
o-o
alcohol
o-o
businesses,
o-o
and the
o-o
tobacco
o-o
industry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
because
o-o
sleazy
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers
o-o
would be at the bottom
o-o
paying the highest
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
Now it's finally
o-o
so much clearer
o-o
who I should fight!
sentence-next
o-o
And how I can fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I like it!
sentence-next
o-o
It would benefit
o-o
the business
o-o
I want to
o-o
create.
sentence-next
o-o
And the one
o-o
I work in.
sentence-next
o-o
Would it also
o-o
benefit
o-o
my friend who
o-o
wants to start a
o-o
restaurant?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Single hyphen-here location
o-o
restaurants
o-o
would get
o-o
the tax break.
sentence-next
o-o
They make something
o-o
that attracts
o-o
money from
o-o
customers
o-o
outside the area.
sentence-next
o-o
In contrast,
o-o
chain
o-o
restaurants
o-o
extract money
o-o
from the local
o-o
economy
o-o
and send it to
o-o
their headquarters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And those
o-o
chain food places
o-o
don't do real
o-o
cooking.
sentence-next
o-o
Their idea
o-o
of food prep
o-o
is dispensing
o-o
and heating.
