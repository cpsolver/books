ambee sings-desha amenn
Bring it on!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
First,
o-o
do you see
o-o
that voting,
o-o
and laws,
o-o
and taxes,
o-o
and jail time,
o-o
are all forms of
o-o
communication?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can see that
o-o
voters try to
o-o
use their ballot
o-o
to say we want
o-o
more of this,
o-o
and less of that.
sentence-next
o-o
Alas, it's still
o-o
at the
o-o
mumbling stage
o-o
of communication.
sentence-next
o-o
But taxes,
o-o
and jail time,
o-o
how are those
o-o
communication?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
State governments
o-o
use alcohol taxes
o-o
to discourage us
o-o
from becoming
o-o
alcoholics.
sentence-next
o-o
And Wall Street
o-o
executives
o-o
never going
o-o
to jail
o-o
certainly
o-o
gives a thumbs up
o-o
to financial
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah.
sentence-next
o-o
The IRS
o-o
gives tax breaks
o-o
for gettin'
o-o
married
o-o
and buyin'
o-o
a house.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And buying
o-o
a farm
o-o
and getting
o-o
pregnant.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the idea.
sentence-next
o-o
Now consider
o-o
that already
o-o
a city
o-o
government,
o-o
or state
o-o
government,
o-o
gives a tax break
o-o
to a big new
o-o
factory
o-o
that moves to,
o-o
or stays in,
o-o
their city
o-o
or state.
sentence-next
o-o
However,
o-o
usually,
o-o
small
o-o
businesses
o-o
don't get those
o-o
tax breaks.
sentence-next
o-o
Not even if they
o-o
make something
o-o
and sell it to
o-o
customers
o-o
around the world.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet if those small
o-o
businesses
o-o
got a good break
o-o
on their taxes,
o-o
that would
o-o
motivate
o-o
more of
o-o
those kinds of
o-o
businesses
o-o
to grow and be
o-o
created.
sentence-next
o-o
The result
o-o
would be
o-o
more money
o-o
coming into
o-o
that city
o-o
or state.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So why don't cities
o-o
and states
o-o
give those
o-o
tax breaks?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Under our current
o-o
election system,
o-o
lobbyists
o-o
and big
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
would insist on
o-o
giving those
o-o
tax breaks to the
o-o
opposite
o-o
kind of
o-o
business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the
o-o
opposite?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A law firm
o-o
claiming they
o-o
create
o-o
valuable
o-o
documents,
o-o
even though
o-o
the document
o-o
is worthless
o-o
to anyone
o-o
other than the
o-o
person who
o-o
requested it.
sentence-next
o-o
Or a
o-o
small lumber
o-o
company
o-o
cutting down
o-o
lots of trees,
o-o
making lumber,
o-o
and selling it
o-o
to Japan
o-o
without
o-o
considering
o-o
the loss of trees.
sentence-next
o-o
Speaking of which,
o-o
long ago
o-o
in Japan
o-o
they foolishly
o-o
cut down their
o-o
own forests
o-o
for firewood,
o-o
so now they pay
o-o
high prices
o-o
for lumber.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Restaurants
o-o
make things
o-o
that are
o-o
valuable
o-o
to hungry
o-o
rich folks.
sentence-next
o-o
Would they get
o-o
that tax break?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If it's a
o-o
single hyphen-here location
o-o
restaurant,
o-o
yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Because
o-o
they attract
o-o
customers
o-o
to the city or
o-o
neighborhood.
sentence-next
o-o
But not if it's
o-o
a chain
o-o
restaurant.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the difference?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A chain business
o-o
extracts money
o-o
from the local
o-o
economy
o-o
and sends it to
o-o
their headquarters.
sentence-next
o-o
In the case of
o-o
McDonald's,
o-o
the corporation
o-o
extorts extra
o-o
money by not
o-o
allowing
o-o
franchise owners
o-o
to repair
o-o
their own
o-o
milkshake
o-o
machines.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What if a
o-o
small restaurant
o-o
just makes
o-o
jello,
o-o
soggy fries,
o-o
and fennel
o-o
milkshakes?
sentence-next
o-o
That's not
o-o
valuable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Their tax break
o-o
will be tiny,
o-o
just like
o-o
their income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I hope
o-o
the tax break
o-o
goes to small
o-o
businesses
o-o
that hire artists,
o-o
actors,
o-o
composers,
o-o
and
o-o
writers
o-o
because
o-o
those folks create
o-o
things like
o-o
songs,
o-o
books,
o-o
videos,
o-o
paintings,
o-o
and odd
o-o
jewelry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If the tax break
o-o
is well designed,
o-o
yes it will
o-o
benefit
o-o
those kinds of
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Under current
o-o
conditions
o-o
the paperwork
o-o
to get tax breaks
o-o
is burdensome.
sentence-next
o-o
So I hope
o-o
it's super easy
o-o
to get
o-o
these tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes if it's
o-o
well designed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there a name
o-o
for the kinds
o-o
of businesses
o-o
that deserve,
o-o
and don't deserve,
o-o
the tax break?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics deserve end-italics
o-o
is judgmental.
sentence-next
o-o
So it's a matter
o-o
of opinion.
sentence-next
o-o
There might be times
o-o
when you,
o-o
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
think you,
o-o
name-damien no-space ,
o-o
deserves to be
o-o
spanked.
sentence-next
o-o
But that would be
o-o
a judgment,
o-o
not a fact.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In this case
o-o
it's a fact.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
As for names,
o-o
the ones I've read
o-o
are maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
and taker
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I like that.
sentence-next
o-o
People like me
o-o
who make things
o-o
work for maker
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The taker
o-o
businesses
o-o
would include
o-o
law firms,
o-o
pawn shops,
o-o
payday loan
o-o
companies,
o-o
and real hyphen-here estate
o-o
developers,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And corporations,
o-o
even if they're small,
o-o
are taker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Some corporations
o-o
create lots of
o-o
valuable
o-o
products
o-o
and services.
sentence-next
o-o
That kind is a
o-o
maker
o-o
business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which corporations
o-o
create value?
sentence-next
o-o
I thought all
o-o
corporations
o-o
are predatory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Admittedly
o-o
big corporations
o-o
do tend to be
o-o
greedy.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet when a biz
o-o
is young
o-o
and small
o-o
and sparsely
o-o
funded,
o-o
it can't grow
o-o
if it doesn't
o-o
offer something
o-o
that benefits
o-o
lots of people.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I have my doubts
o-o
about that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are there
o-o
examples?
sentence-next
o-o
Somethin' from
o-o
history?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when Google
o-o
started out,
o-o
it gave better
o-o
search results,
o-o
and fewer ads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now Google
o-o
hides its ads
o-o
on the websites
o-o
it sends people to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Amazon
o-o
started as
o-o
a bookstore
o-o
that gave
o-o
beginning
o-o
book authors
o-o
a way to
o-o
bypass the
o-o
monopolistic
o-o
New York City
o-o
book publishers
o-o
who were
o-o
inefficiently
o-o
renting
o-o
New York City
o-o
office space.
sentence-next
o-o
When it was small,
o-o
Bank of
o-o
America
o-o
catered to
o-o
wealthy
o-o
Chinese
o-o
Americans
o-o
in Chinatown,
o-o
back when
o-o
other banks
o-o
shunned those folks.
sentence-next
o-o
What's important
o-o
to realize
o-o
is there are lots
o-o
of begin-italics small end-italics
o-o
corporations
o-o
you've never
o-o
heard of
o-o
that benefit
o-o
lots of people
o-o
in lots of
o-o
wonderful
o-o
ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like with
o-o
rich people?
sentence-next
o-o
Some
o-o
corporations
o-o
are good,
o-o
and some are bad?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
And I'm glad
o-o
you see that
o-o
simply taxing
o-o
wealthy individuals
o-o
isn't the key.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I learned
o-o
they can evade
o-o
individual
o-o
taxation.
sentence-next
o-o
'N exploit
o-o
deductions
o-o
in their
o-o
businesses.
