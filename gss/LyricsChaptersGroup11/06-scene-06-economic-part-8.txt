Oh, OK.
sentence-next
o-o
But my brain's
o-o
startin' to drain
o-o
'cause this seems like
o-o
sorting peaches
o-o
from apricots.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there some
o-o
pattern?
sentence-next
o-o
I mean
o-o
for sorting
o-o
takers from
o-o
makers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In general the
o-o
spectrum from
o-o
makers to takers
o-o
would be something
o-o
like this.
sentence-next
o-o
It starts with
o-o
farming and ranching.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to manufacturing,
o-o
cooking, brewing,
o-o
entertaining,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
inventing,
o-o
software developing,
o-o
oil refining,
o-o
research if it isn't
o-o
market research,
o-o
and other such
o-o
making activities.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to
o-o
teaching and training.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to healthcare,
o-o
grocery sales,
o-o
meat packing,
o-o
canning,
o-o
and maintenance.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to shipping,
o-o
retail stores,
o-o
hospitality,
o-o
and more.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to advertising
o-o
and marketing.
sentence-next
o-o
Then finally to
o-o
banking, insurance,
o-o
legal services,
o-o
real estate developers,
o-o
logging, mining,
o-o
casinos,
o-o
alcohol
o-o
businesses,
o-o
and the
o-o
tobacco
o-o
industry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
sentence-next
o-o
Especially because
o-o
sleazy
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers
o-o
would be at the bottom
o-o
paying the highest
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
Now it's finally
o-o
so much clearer
o-o
who I should fight!
sentence-next
o-o
And how I can fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that better
o-o
voting methods
o-o
would allow us
o-o
voters to elect
o-o
politicians
o-o
who'd pass laws
o-o
that change business
o-o
taxes?
sentence-next
o-o
In ways that
o-o
would lead to
o-o
a stronger
o-o
economy?
sentence-next
o-o
So there's
o-o
a big flow of
o-o
money into the
o-o
United States?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And higher
o-o
taxes for
o-o
vulture
o-o
businesses
o-o
that earn their
o-o
money from
o-o
local customers?
sentence-next
o-o
Like law firms,
o-o
Wall Street banks,
o-o
insurance
o-o
companies,
and
real-estate
o-o
developers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm not saying
o-o
what should be done,
o-o
or will be done.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm saying that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
would increase
o-o
if those changes
o-o
were made.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So it would
o-o
make lots more
o-o
cherry pies!
sentence-next
o-o
Then there'd be
o-o
less fighting
o-o
for smaller
o-o
and smaller
o-o
slices
o-o
from just one
o-o
cherry pie.
sentence-next
o-o
Then everyone
o-o
who deserves
o-o
can get
o-o
a bigger
o-o
slice!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Unfortunately
o-o
those reforms
o-o
will never
o-o
happen under
o-o
our current
o-o
election
o-o
system.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It seems like
o-o
this reform
o-o
would only
o-o
decrease
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for a few people
o-o
who earn their money
o-o
by owning
o-o
taker businesses,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This sounds great!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm ready for this fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it will
o-o
motivate
o-o
citizens
o-o
in Russia,
o-o
China,
o-o
and North
o-o
Korea
o-o
to overthrow
o-o
their
o-o
corrupt
o-o
dictatorships.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why
o-o
dictators
o-o
block news
o-o
that reveals
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
in democracies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And why
o-o
authors like the
o-o
Condorcet guy
o-o
get killed
o-o
when they
o-o
criticize
o-o
corruption by
o-o
the people
o-o
in power.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
And why
o-o
wannabe
o-o
dictators
o-o
get assistance
o-o
from Russian
o-o
and Chinese
o-o
hackers
o-o
who exploit
o-o
social media.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey! I see a pattern.
sentence-next
o-o
The owners of
o-o
taker businesses
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
sentence-next
o-o
'N currently
o-o
their businesses
o-o
get so many tax breaks
o-o
they pay low
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
'N the owners
o-o
of small maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
like the one
o-o
I work in,
o-o
'n the one
o-o
I'd like to build,
o-o
they're in the
o-o
political up.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet they pay high
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
'N get
o-o
few tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hey!
sentence-next
o-o
The economy's
o-o
like a bat
o-o
takin' a nap.
sentence-next
o-o
It's upside down!
sentence-next
o-o
We're taxin' the
o-o
fruitful makers
o-o
more than the
o-o
vulture takers!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes,
o-o
in some ways
o-o
the economic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see something
o-o
else!
sentence-next
o-o
Suppose law
o-o
offices
o-o
were taxed more.
sentence-next
o-o
Then lawyers
o-o
would earn less
o-o
than they do now.
sentence-next
o-o
That means some smart
o-o
pre hyphen-here law students
o-o
would abandon
o-o
their path to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs as lawyers,
o-o
and instead choose
o-o
career paths
o-o
that lead to
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
where their
o-o
salaries would be
o-o
better than now
o-o
because maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
would be taxed less.
sentence-next
o-o
That job migration
o-o
would use U.S.
o-o
brainpower
o-o
much more
o-o
efficiently.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the same thing
o-o
would happen with
o-o
smart people being
o-o
less attracted
o-o
to soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs on Wall Street.
sentence-next
o-o
But wait a
o-o
minute.
sentence-next
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
I think that might
o-o
mean a lower
o-o
salary for me
o-o
'cause I'm not
o-o
a smart guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Does this guy
o-o
really not know how
o-o
smart he is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He hasn't done
o-o
much reading so
o-o
he's not book smart.
sentence-next
o-o
But he's very smart
o-o
in common sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Which is all too
o-o
uncommon,
o-o
alas.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I'm so smart,
o-o
why'd I flunk
o-o
out of community
o-o
college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because you've got
o-o
a vision
o-o
disability
o-o
that schools
o-o
don't test for.
sentence-next
o-o
That makes schools
o-o
stupid.
sentence-next
o-o
Not you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My world's
o-o
so upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
In so many ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's fix that.
sentence-next
o-o
What's still
o-o
confusing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I keep hearing
o-o
the economy's
o-o
on the climbing
o-o
path of a
o-o
roller coaster.
sentence-next
o-o
But I'm in
o-o
one of the cars
o-o
that's derailed,
o-o
and I'm
o-o
plunging
o-o
fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The stock market
o-o
keeps going up and up
o-o
because people
o-o
with money have
o-o
few other places
o-o
to invest it.
sentence-next
o-o
Specifically
o-o
certificates
o-o
of deposit
o-o
haven't been
o-o
yielding much
o-o
interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I suppose
o-o
that gives
o-o
the stock market
o-o
sort of a
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So stocks are
o-o
like an
o-o
over-inflated
o-o
balloon.
sentence-next
o-o
Does that mean our
o-o
roller coaster
o-o
ride will soon
o-o
plummet?
sentence-next
o-o
And the poor
o-o
will all die?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's difficult
o-o
to predict when
o-o
it will drop
o-o
from its
o-o
recent
o-o
top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You said
o-o
economists
o-o
predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Knowing begin-italics what end-italics will
o-o
happen is
o-o
different
o-o
from knowing begin-italics when end-italics
o-o
those whats will
o-o
happen.
sentence-next
o-o
Professors
o-o
of economics
o-o
focus on
o-o
rational
o-o
behavior.
sentence-next
o-o
But successful
o-o
investors earn
o-o
lots of money
o-o
by knowing the
o-o
stock market
o-o
can stay
o-o
irrational
o-o
longer than
o-o
investors
o-o
can stay
o-o
solvent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
sentence-next
o-o
Economists
o-o
assume people
o-o
are smart.
sentence-next
o-o
This explains why
o-o
they,
o-o
and you,
o-o
probably
o-o
aren't wealthy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Our math proofs
o-o
do have
o-o
some goofs.
sentence-next
o-o
After all,
o-o
measuring
o-o
stupidity
o-o
is tricky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of
o-o
morons,
o-o
why doesn't
o-o
the economy
o-o
work for
o-o
hard workers
o-o
like me?
sentence-next
o-o
The numbers lie.
sentence-next
o-o
They say
o-o
everything's
o-o
hunky dory.
sentence-next
o-o
Is this an example
o-o
of mathiness?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I don't know what
o-o
mathiness is.
sentence-next
o-o
But numbers can
o-o
be deceptive.
sentence-next
o-o
What many people
o-o
overlook is that
o-o
the unemployment
o-o
rate that's in the news
o-o
just counts people
o-o
who are now getting
o-o
unemployment
o-o
benefits.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Those benefits
o-o
run out after a
o-o
few months of having
o-o
no job. I've learned
o-o
that from
o-o
experience.
sentence-next
o-o
So unemployment
o-o
is actually higher,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, it's higher.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why don't economists
o-o
measure that?
sentence-next
o-o
The real unemployment
o-o
rate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The government
o-o
does measure that
o-o
as well.
sentence-next
o-o
But most
o-o
newspapers and
o-o
TV stations
o-o
report the
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate
o-o
that
o-o
government
o-o
officials call
o-o
attention to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since wealthy
o-o
business owners
o-o
own news sources,
o-o
they probably
o-o
tell their
o-o
reporters
o-o
to report the
o-o
lower rate.
sentence-next
o-o
That gives
o-o
consumers
o-o
the confidence
o-o
to spend dollars
o-o
more freely.
sentence-next
o-o
And that gives
o-o
the wealthy
o-o
more sales,
o-o
more money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought it was
o-o
just the
o-o
government
o-o
being sneaky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's both.
sentence-next
o-o
The government
o-o
knows that if they
o-o
call attention
o-o
to the higher
o-o
actual
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate,
o-o
then consumers
o-o
will have less
o-o
optimism.
sentence-next
o-o
And when there's
o-o
less optimism
o-o
consumers
o-o
spend less money,
o-o
and that loops
o-o
back through
o-o
businesses
o-o
to fewer jobs
o-o
and lower
o-o
salaries
o-o
for other
o-o
employees,
o-o
who then spend
o-o
less money.
sentence-next
o-o
That's a powerful
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric
