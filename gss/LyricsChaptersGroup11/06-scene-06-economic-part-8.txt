None of them!
end-lyric

money?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My boss,

and owners of

similar small

o-o
And maybe

Elon Musk

But he's a jerk.
sentence-next
o-o
He's using

Twitter

our planet

so he'll get more

customers

cult.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
So was Bill Gates
o-o
in his early years.
sentence-next
o-o
Being a jerk,
o-o
I mean.
sentence-next
o-o
But here we're
o-o
just talking

about whether

they've done things

that strengthen the

economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
Oprah Winfrey

And Stephen

he makes me

the crazy

politics.

ambee sings-damien amenn
They're all

in the political

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's hard to judge
o-o
which individuals
o-o
are in what
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up versus down.
sentence-next
o-o
It's easier to do
o-o
with businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With individuals
o-o
we just need to look
o-o
at how much they give
o-o
to politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Following the
o-o
flow of money
o-o
in politics
o-o
is like slicing
o-o
an onion.
sentence-next
o-o
There are lots
o-o
of layers
o-o
to cut through,
o-o
and it becomes
o-o
hard to see
o-o
because
o-o
tears come to
o-o
your eyes.
sentence-next
o-o
It's easier to
o-o
separate the
o-o
takers from the makers
o-o
in businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
We look at
o-o
what the biz
o-o
does.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What if the biz

does both?
sentence-next
o-o
Making and

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We can prorate it.
end-lyric

Get professionals

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Prorating.
sentence-next
o-o
It's another

kind of
o-o
division.
sentence-next
o-o
The math kind.
sentence-next
o-o
It involves
o-o
percentages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, OK.
sentence-next
o-o
But my brain's
o-o
startin' to drain

'cause this seems like

sorting peaches

from apricots.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there some
o-o
pattern?
sentence-next
o-o
I mean
o-o
for sorting
o-o
takers from
o-o
makers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In general the
o-o
spectrum from
o-o
makers to takers
o-o
would be something
o-o
like this.
sentence-next
o-o
It starts with
o-o
farming and ranching.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to manufacturing,
o-o
cooking, brewing,
o-o
entertaining,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
inventing,
o-o
software developing,
o-o
oil refining,
o-o
research if it isn't

market research,

and other such

making activities.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to

teaching and training.

o-o
Then to healthcare,

grocery sales,

meat packing,

canning,

and maintenance.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to shipping,
o-o
retail stores,

hospitality,
o-o
and more.
sentence-next
o-o
Then to advertising
o-o
and marketing.
sentence-next
o-o
Then finally to
o-o
banking, insurance,

legal services,
o-o
real estate developers,
o-o
logging, mining,
o-o
casinos,
o-o
alcohol
o-o
businesses,
o-o
and the
o-o
tobacco
o-o
industry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
sentence-next
o-o
Especially because
o-o
sleazy
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers
o-o
would be at the bottom
o-o
paying the highest
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
Now it's finally
o-o
so much clearer
o-o
who I should fight!
sentence-next
o-o
And how I can fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that better
o-o
voting methods
o-o
would allow us
o-o
voters to elect
o-o
politicians
o-o
who'd pass laws
o-o
that change business
o-o
taxes?
sentence-next
o-o
In ways that
o-o
would lead to
o-o
a stronger
o-o
economy?
sentence-next
o-o
So there's
o-o
a big flow of
o-o
money into the
o-o
United States?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And higher
o-o
taxes for
o-o
vulture
o-o
businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm not saying
o-o
what should be done,
o-o
or will be done.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm saying that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
would increase
o-o
if those changes
o-o
were made.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So it would
o-o
make lots more
o-o
savory pies!
sentence-next
o-o
Then there'd be
o-o
less fighting
o-o
for smaller
o-o
and smaller
o-o
slices
o-o
from just one
o-o
savory pie.
sentence-next
o-o
Then everyone
o-o
who deserves
o-o
can get
o-o
a bigger
o-o
slice!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Unfortunately
o-o
those reforms
o-o
will never
o-o
happen under
o-o
our current
o-o
election
o-o
system.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It seems like
o-o
this reform
o-o
would only
o-o
decrease
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for a few people
o-o
who earn their money
o-o
by owning
o-o
taker businesses,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This sounds great!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm ready for this fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it will
o-o
motivate
o-o
citizens
o-o
in Russia,
o-o
China,
o-o
and North
o-o
Korea
o-o
to overthrow
o-o
their
o-o
corrupt
o-o
dictatorships.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why

dictators

block news
o-o
that reveals
o-o
better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
in democracies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And why
o-o
authors like the

get killed

when they

criticize
o-o
corruption by
o-o
the people

in power.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
And why

wannabe

get assistance

from Russian

o-o
hackers

who exploit
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey! I see a pattern.
sentence-next
o-o
The owners of

taker businesses

are in the

political down.
sentence-next
o-o
'N currently

get so many tax breaks

they pay low

tax rates.

'N the owners

of small maker

including

the one I'd like

they're in the

Yet they pay high

few tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hey!
sentence-next
o-o
The economy's
o-o
like a bat

takin' a nap.
sentence-next
o-o
It's upside down!
sentence-next
o-o
We're taxin' the

fruitful makers
o-o
more than the

vulture takers!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes,
o-o
in some ways
o-o
the economic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see something
o-o
else!
sentence-next
o-o
Suppose law
o-o
offices
o-o
were taxed more.
sentence-next
o-o
Then lawyers
o-o
would earn less
o-o
than they do now.
sentence-next
o-o
That means some smart
o-o
pre hyphen-here law students
o-o
would abandon
o-o
their path to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs as lawyers.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead they'd choose
o-o
careers
o-o
in maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
that offer
o-o
higher salaries
o-o
than now.
sentence-next
o-o
That job migration
o-o
would use U.S.
o-o
brainpower
o-o
much more
o-o
efficiently.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does this mean
o-o
my salary
o-o
would drop?
sentence-next
o-o
'Cause I'm not
o-o
a smart guy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Does this guy
o-o
really not know how
o-o
smart he is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He hasn't done
o-o
much reading so
o-o
he's not book smart.
sentence-next
o-o
But he's very smart
o-o
in common sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Which is all too
o-o
uncommon,
o-o
alas.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I'm so smart,
o-o
why'd I flunk
o-o
out of community
o-o
college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because you've got
o-o
a vision
o-o
disability
o-o
that schools
o-o
don't test for.
sentence-next
o-o
That makes schools
o-o
stupid.
sentence-next
o-o
Not you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My world's

so upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
In so many ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's fix that.
sentence-next
o-o
What's still

confusing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I keep hearing
o-o
the economy's
o-o
on the climbing

path of a

roller coaster.

o-o
But I'm in

one of the cars

and I'm
o-o
plunging
o-o
fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The stock market
o-o
keeps going up and up
o-o
because people
o-o
with money have
o-o
few other places
o-o
to invest it.
sentence-next
o-o
Specifically
o-o
certificates
o-o
of deposit
o-o
haven't been

yielding much

interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Because of those

auctions.

sort of a

monopoly.
