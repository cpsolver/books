And it's harder
o-o
to figure out
o-o
which rich folks
o-o
deserve to be
o-o
wealthy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
None of them!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Can you not think
o-o
of any
o-o
rich people
o-o
who deserve
o-o
to earn lots of
o-o
money?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
Oprah Winfrey
o-o
deserves
o-o
her wealth.

And Stephen
o-o
Colbert begin-explain pronounced begin-italics cole-BARE end-italics end-explain

does because
o-o
he makes me
o-o
laugh about
o-o
the crazy

antics in

politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They're both
o-o
in the political
o-o
up, along with
o-o
us voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's hard to judge
o-o
which individuals
o-o
are in what
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up versus down.
sentence-next
o-o
It's easier to do
o-o
with businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With individuals
o-o
we just need to look
o-o
at how much they give
o-o
to politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Following the
o-o
flow of money
o-o
in politics
o-o
is like slicing
o-o
an onion.
sentence-next
o-o
There are lots
o-o
of layers
o-o
to cut through,
o-o
and it becomes
o-o
hard to see
o-o
because
o-o
tears come to
o-o
your eyes.
sentence-next
o-o
It's easier to
o-o
separate the
o-o
takers from the makers
o-o
in businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
We look at
o-o
what the biz
o-o
does.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK.
sentence-next
o-o
But my brain's
o-o
startin' to drain
o-o
'cause this seems like
o-o
sorting peaches
o-o
from apricots.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there some
o-o
pattern?
sentence-next
o-o
I mean
o-o
for sorting
o-o
takers from
o-o
makers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In general the
o-o
spectrum from
o-o
makers to takers
o-o
starts with
o-o
farming and ranching.
sentence-next
o-o
They already
o-o
get tax breaks,
o-o
regardless
o-o
of size.
sentence-next
o-o
The other
o-o
main maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
include
o-o
manufacturing,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
inventing,
o-o
software developing,
o-o
cooking,
o-o
and
o-o
entertaining.
sentence-next
o-o
There are lots
o-o
of intermediate
o-o
categories
o-o
such as teaching,
o-o
healthcare,
o-o
maintenance,
o-o
transportation,
o-o
retail,
o-o
hospitality,
o-o
and
o-o
marketing.
sentence-next
o-o
At the full
o-o
taker end
o-o
there's
o-o
banking,
o-o
insurance,
o-o
legal services,
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers,
o-o
logging,
o-o
mining,
o-o
casinos,
o-o
alcohol
o-o
businesses,
o-o
and the
o-o
tobacco
o-o
industry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
sentence-next
o-o
Especially because
o-o
sleazy
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers
o-o
would be at the bottom
o-o
paying the highest
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
Now it's finally
o-o
so much clearer
o-o
who I should fight!
sentence-next
o-o
And how I can fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So this will
o-o
make lots more
o-o
savory pies?
sentence-next
o-o
Then there will be
o-o
less fighting
o-o
for smaller
o-o
and smaller
o-o
slices
o-o
from just one
o-o
savory pie?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
Unfortunately
o-o
those reforms
o-o
will never
o-o
happen under
o-o
our current
o-o
election
o-o
system.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It seems like
o-o
this reform
o-o
would only
o-o
decrease
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for a few people
o-o
who earn their money
o-o
by owning
o-o
taker businesses,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This sounds great!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm ready for this fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it will
o-o
motivate
o-o
citizens
o-o
in Russia,
o-o
China,
o-o
and North
o-o
Korea
o-o
to overthrow
o-o
their
o-o
corrupt
o-o
dictatorships.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why
o-o
dictators
o-o
block news
o-o
that reveals
o-o
better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
in democracies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey!
sentence-next
o-o
I see a pattern.
sentence-next
o-o
The owners of
o-o
taker businesses
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
sentence-next
o-o
'N currently
o-o
their businesses
o-o
get so many tax breaks
o-o
they pay low
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
'N the owners
o-o
of small maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
including
o-o
the one I'd like
o-o
to build,
o-o
they're in the
o-o
political up.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet they pay high
o-o
tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
'N get
o-o
few tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hey!
sentence-next
o-o
The economy's
o-o
like a bat
o-o
takin' a nap.
sentence-next
o-o
It's upside down!
sentence-next
o-o
We're taxin' the
o-o
fruitful makers
o-o
more than the
o-o
vulture takers!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes,
o-o
in some ways
o-o
the economic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's certainly
o-o
upside down
o-o
for me
o-o
since I'm not
o-o
a smart guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Does this guy
o-o
really not know how
o-o
smart he is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He hasn't done
o-o
much reading so
o-o
he's not book smart.
sentence-next
o-o
But he's very smart
o-o
in common sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Which is all too
o-o
uncommon,
o-o
alas.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I'm so smart,
o-o
why'd I flunk
o-o
out of community
o-o
college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because you've got
o-o
a vision
o-o
disability
o-o
that schools
o-o
don't test for.
sentence-next
o-o
That makes schools
o-o
stupid.
sentence-next
o-o
Not you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My world's
o-o
so upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
In so many ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's fix that.
sentence-next
o-o
What's still
o-o
confusing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I keep hearing
o-o
the economy's
o-o
on the climbing
o-o
path of a
o-o
roller coaster.
sentence-next
o-o
But I'm in
o-o
one of the cars
o-o
that's derailed,
o-o
and I'm
o-o
plunging
o-o
fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The stock market
o-o
keeps going up and up
o-o
because people
o-o
with money have
o-o
few other places
o-o
to invest it.
sentence-next
o-o
Specifically
o-o
certificates
o-o
of deposit
o-o
haven't been
o-o
yielding much
o-o
interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Because of those
o-o
auctions,
o-o
right?
sentence-next
o-o
I suppose
o-o
that gives
o-o
the stock market
o-o
sort of a
o-o
monopoly.
