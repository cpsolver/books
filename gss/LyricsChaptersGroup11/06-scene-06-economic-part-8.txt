o-o
taker businesses
o-o
pay lower taxes.
sentence-next

to get tax breaks,
o-o
subsidies,
o-o
and monopolies.

Hey!
sentence-next
o-o
The economy's
o-o
like a bat
o-o
taking a nap.
sentence-next
o-o
It's upside down!
sentence-next

fruitful makers
o-o
more than the
o-o
vulture takers!

Alas, yes,
o-o
in some ways
o-o
the economic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's certainly
o-o
upside down
o-o
for me
o-o
since I'm not
o-o
a smart guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Does this guy
o-o
really not know how
o-o
smart he is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He hasn't done
o-o
much reading so
o-o
he's not book smart.
sentence-next
o-o
But he's very smart
o-o
in common sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Which is all too
o-o
uncommon,
o-o
alas.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I'm so smart,
o-o
why'd I flunk
o-o
out of community
o-o
college?

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because you've got
o-o
a vision
o-o
disability
o-o
that schools
o-o
don't test for.
sentence-next
o-o
That makes schools
o-o
stupid.
sentence-next
o-o
Not you.

My world's
o-o
so upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
In so many ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's fix that.
sentence-next
o-o
What's still
o-o
confusing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I keep hearing
o-o
the economy's
o-o
on the climbing
o-o
path of a
o-o
roller coaster.
sentence-next
o-o
But I'm in
o-o
one of the cars
o-o
that's derailed,
o-o
and I'm
o-o
plunging
o-o
fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The stock market
o-o
keeps going up and up
o-o
because people
o-o
with money have
o-o
few other places
o-o
to invest it.
sentence-next
o-o
Specifically
o-o
certificates
o-o
of deposit
o-o
haven't been
o-o
yielding much
o-o
interest.
end-lyric

Because of those
o-o
auctions,
o-o

the stock market
o-o
sort of a
o-o
monopoly.
