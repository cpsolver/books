Back to the idea
o-o
of no losers.
sentence-next
o-o
Surely some folks
o-o
would lose out
o-o
economically
o-o
if elections
o-o
were more fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yes, there are some
o-o
businesses
o-o
that exploit
o-o
begin-italics unfairness end-italics
o-o
and they would have
o-o
their profits reduced
o-o
because of
o-o
higher taxes.
sentence-next
o-o
And because of
o-o
fewer
o-o
monopolies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Such as?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You taught me
o-o
about
o-o
commodities
o-o
so you know
o-o
there's two kinds
o-o
of sugar there.
sentence-next
o-o
I forgot
o-o
the numbers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You must mean
o-o
sugar number
o-o
eleven
o-o
and sugar
o-o
number
o-o
sixteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The higher price
o-o
is the one
o-o
in the U.S.
sentence-next
o-o
The rest of the
o-o
world pays
o-o
the lower price.
sentence-next
o-o
The people
o-o
in Florida
o-o
who exploit
o-o
that legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
would lose income.
sentence-next
o-o
But all of us
o-o
in the U.S.
o-o
would pay less
o-o
for sugar
o-o
and sugarized
o-o
products.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Hmm,
o-o
you're right.
sentence-next
o-o
I knew I was
o-o
subsidizing
o-o
some wealthy guys
o-o
in Florida,
o-o
but I wasn't
o-o
bothered.
sentence-next
o-o
That extra cost
o-o
for sugar
o-o
is tiny.
sentence-next
o-o
Even for me,
o-o
who isn't.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Each price squeeze,
o-o
considered
o-o
one at a time,
o-o
isn't
o-o
a big deal.
sentence-next
o-o
But those price hikes
o-o
surround us.
sentence-next
o-o
That's a big steal
o-o
from those of us
o-o
who can barely
o-o
afford rent
o-o
and food and
o-o
utilities.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In addition
o-o
to ending
o-o
outright
o-o
corruption,
o-o
there would be
o-o
tax breaks
o-o
for some kinds
o-o
of businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Which businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Businesses
o-o
that bring money
o-o
into the
o-o
region
o-o
from customers
o-o
outside
o-o
the region.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course
o-o
that includes
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
Also it can
o-o
be businesses
o-o
that involve
o-o
software,
o-o
artists,
o-o
and
o-o
entertainment.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus non hyphen-here chain
o-o
restaurants.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Tax breaks
o-o
already go to
o-o
businesses
o-o
like that.
sentence-next
o-o
You mean Apple,
o-o
Boeing,
o-o
Disney,
o-o
General Motors,
o-o
Intel,
o-o
Nike,
o-o
Hollywood
o-o
movie studios,
o-o
and such,
o-o
right?
sentence-next
o-o
Why should
o-o
they get more?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This new tax break
o-o
will be for
o-o
similar
o-o
businesses
o-o
that are small.
sentence-next
o-o
They don't have
o-o
time or money
o-o
to lobby
o-o
for special
o-o
tax breaks.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet there are
o-o
many
o-o
thousands
o-o
of them
o-o
in our city.
sentence-next
o-o
Collectively
o-o
they greatly
o-o
enrich
o-o
our local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You said non hyphen-here chain
o-o
restaurants.
sentence-next
o-o
Why not chain
o-o
restaurants?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Chain businesses
o-o
send lots of
o-o
their profits
o-o
to corporate
o-o
headquarters.
sentence-next
o-o
That drains
o-o
money from
o-o
the local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And nobody
o-o
chooses a city
o-o
as their travel
o-o
destination
o-o
because
o-o
they look forward
o-o
to dining out
o-o
at a
o-o
Burger King
o-o
franchise
o-o
location.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I often sell
o-o
condos
o-o
and homes
o-o
to people from
o-o
elsewhere.
sentence-next
o-o
That brings
o-o
lots of wealth
o-o
into our local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That brings
o-o
money to you,
o-o
but it increases
o-o
traffic,
o-o
and reduces
o-o
the land
o-o
available
o-o
for homes
o-o
that are more
o-o
affordable,
o-o
which is what
o-o
we need more of.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Pushing up
o-o
the cost of
o-o
housing
o-o
pushes
o-o
more and more
o-o
people into
o-o
homelessness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Oh, I think I'm
o-o
beginning
o-o
to see.
sentence-next
o-o
We could
o-o
reduce taxes
o-o
on activities
o-o
that enrich the
o-o
local
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
Without giving
o-o
yet more tax breaks
o-o
to businesses
o-o
that do
o-o
activities that
o-o
drain the
o-o
local economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Exactly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
So it taxes the sinners
o-o
and helps the saints?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a useful
o-o
way to view it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I like it!
sentence-next
o-o
Even though
o-o
it might offend
o-o
many of the
o-o
folks who need
o-o
religion
o-o
the most.
sentence-next
o-o
Like lawyers,
o-o
bankers, and
o-o
CFOs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aliens?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not UFOs.
sentence-next
o-o
CFOs.
sentence-next
o-o
Chief
o-o
financial
o-o
officers.
sentence-next
o-o
Father takes
o-o
seriously
o-o
the saying
o-o
begin-italics know thine

enemy end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Our church
o-o
welcomes
o-o
everyone.
sentence-next
o-o
Well,
o-o
maybe not
o-o
aliens,
o-o
the space kind.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
The aliens
o-o
crossing from
o-o
Mexico
o-o
certainly
o-o
don't deserve
o-o
to be welcomed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I suppose
o-o
you would have
o-o
blocked
o-o
Nikola Tesla?
o-o
And Einstein
o-o
too?
sentence-next
o-o
They arrived as
o-o
immigrants.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Things would have
o-o
worked out fine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You'd be
o-o
in the dark
o-o
in more ways
o-o
than one.
sentence-next
o-o
Anyway,
o-o
the
o-o
different
o-o
tax rates are
o-o
like the
o-o
difference
o-o
between a
o-o
word-resume
o-o
and a
o-o
eulogy.
sentence-next
o-o
A word-resume
o-o
values money,
o-o
a eulogy
o-o
values
o-o
benefiting
o-o
others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Interesting
o-o
distinction!
sentence-next
o-o
What I've accomplished
o-o
would look fabulous
o-o
on a word-resume no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
But now it's time
o-o
to consider what
o-o
might be said
o-o
in my eulogy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I don't see the
o-o
difference.
sentence-next
o-o
But then religion
o-o
isn't my thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Clearly money
o-o
is your thing.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet your
o-o
begin-italics taker end-italics
o-o
business
o-o
will earn
o-o
more money
o-o
when there are more
o-o
begin-italics maker end-italics
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A taker
o-o
business is the
o-o
sinning kind,
o-o
and a maker
o-o
business is
o-o
the saintly kind.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Why would my
o-o
so hyphen-here called taker
o-o
business
o-o
benefit from
o-o
more maker
o-o
businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Maker businesses
o-o
not only bring
o-o
money into
o-o
a city or state,
o-o
they also pass
o-o
that money to
o-o
their employees.
sentence-next
o-o
Those employees
o-o
are customers
o-o
of other
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
Some of that wealth
o-o
reaches your
o-o
customers
o-o
who buy or rent
o-o
from your business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Imagine
o-o
an economic
o-o
apocalypse.
sentence-next
o-o
If there were no
o-o
maker businesses
o-o
in our state,
o-o
no money would
o-o
enter our state,
o-o
and our state's
o-o
economy
o-o
would collapse.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
o-o
It's like
o-o
trickle down
o-o
economics.
sentence-next
o-o
But instead of
o-o
telling folks
o-o
our money will
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to them,
o-o
the money
o-o
flowing into
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
really does
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to local
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
I had failed
o-o
to see that
o-o
begin-italics small end-italics maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
also should be
o-o
getting
o-o
tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
So they're like
o-o
the bottom
o-o
level of a
o-o
pyramid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Pointless?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
It sounds to me
o-o
like maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
of all sizes,
o-o
are the
o-o
foundation
o-o
of the local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a good
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Right now
o-o
the pyramid
o-o
is upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
All taker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
big and small,
o-o
get low tax burdens.
sentence-next
o-o
That crushes the
o-o
small maker
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
They crumble
o-o
under
o-o
the burden of
o-o
the highest
o-o
tax rates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
the same
o-o
tax rates as
o-o
law firms,
o-o
insurance
o-o
agencies,
o-o
and franchise
o-o
places.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Some bad symptoms
o-o
of that burden
o-o
include
o-o
unemployment,
o-o
homelessness,
o-o
drug abuse,
o-o
and crime.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not to mention
o-o
anger,
o-o
despair,
o-o
hopelessness,
o-o
and probably
o-o
high
o-o
interest rates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if you
o-o
don't want
o-o
a low hyphen-here wage
o-o
employee
o-o
in a tiny
o-o
studio
o-o
apartment to
o-o
get forced into
o-o
homelessness,
o-o
then into drugs,
o-o
then into crime,
o-o
then into despair,
o-o
now is the time
o-o
to prevent it.
sentence-next
o-o
By caring
o-o
about not just
o-o
begin-italics big end-italics maker
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
begin-italics Small end-italics maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
all together,
o-o
attract huge
o-o
amounts of
o-o
money into
o-o
the local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Another
o-o
benefit of
o-o
taxing takers
o-o
more than makers
o-o
is that very smart
o-o
well hyphen-here educated
o-o
people would be less
o-o
attracted to
o-o
higher paid,
o-o
but soul hyphen-here sucking,
o-o
jobs in
o-o
banks,
o-o
and law firms,
o-o
and real estate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Instead they'd
o-o
work where they

benefit customers,
o-o

o-o
and the overall
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Well said!
sentence-next
