I thought a

feedback loop

for seconds

at an

Apparently
o-o
I need to

better

what a feedback

loop really is.

A feedback loop
o-o
is what makes

end-lyric

Lots of hot air?

o-o
There's lots of it
o-o
in politics.
sentence-next
o-o
It's in

economics
o-o
too?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No,
o-o
you airhead!
sentence-next
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
is when a cause
o-o
and effect
o-o
becomes
o-o
a circle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Basically
o-o
it's as if
o-o
the first effect
o-o
becomes a
o-o
second cause,
o-o
and the
o-o
second effect
o-o
becomes the
o-o
first cause.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So this loop
o-o
between optimism

o-o
is like

your pupper

super poop

scooper loop?
end-lyric

That's a different

kind of
o-o

In economic

feedback loops

focuses on

what they

themselves

want,
o-o
without caring

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
Dog owners,
o-o
the pooper

scooper ones,
o-o
care how many

piles of dog poop

their dog

can sniff.
sentence-next
o-o
But that's
o-o
affected by
o-o
other dog

sentence-next
o-o
There's no

too.

o-o
They use lawyers.

And they use money

elections

control

politicians.
sentence-next
o-o
They use
o-o
feedback loops

to give themselves

Is there even

any hope the big

end-lyric

Yet that didn't

You've mentioned

a well hyphen-here designed

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What would that

look like?
sentence-next
o-o
How will it work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Some kinds of
o-o
businesses
o-o
will get

a big extra

tax credit
o-o
if their
o-o
salary gap
o-o
between
o-o
managers
o-o
and workers
o-o
is lower
o-o
than most other
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would give

which fuels

other

right?
end-lyric

Indeed it would.

Is there a way

that wage gap?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sure,
o-o
just average
o-o
the salaries
o-o

subtract them,

sentence-next
o-o
So he's saying
o-o
to split the employees

into two groups
o-o
of equal size.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A small number
o-o
for the wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
index
o-o
means managers
o-o
and executives
o-o
are sharing
o-o
more of the profits
o-o
with their employees
o-o
who get the
o-o
lower salaries.
sentence-next
o-o
So those businesses

get rewarded

with a bigger

tax break.

The wage gap

end-lyric

This wage hyphen-here gap

also covers

Remember,

there would be

That would

efficiency.
end-lyric

You're the one
