So stocks are

like an

balloon?
sentence-next
o-o
Does this mean our

plummet?

o-o
And the poor

It's difficult

to predict when

it will drop

top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You said
o-o
economists
o-o
predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Knowing begin-italics what end-italics will
o-o
happen is
o-o
different
o-o
from knowing begin-italics when end-italics
o-o
those whats will
o-o
happen.
sentence-next
o-o
Professors
o-o
of economics
o-o
focus on
o-o
rational

behavior.
sentence-next
o-o
But successful
o-o
investors earn
o-o
lots of money
o-o
by knowing the
o-o
stock market
o-o
can stay
o-o
irrational
o-o
longer than
o-o
investors
o-o
can stay

solvent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
sentence-next
o-o
Economists
o-o
assume people
o-o
are smart.
sentence-next
o-o
This explains why
o-o
they,

and you,
o-o
probably
o-o
aren't wealthy.

Our math proofs

After all,
o-o
measuring

is tricky.
end-lyric

Speaking of

morons,
o-o
why doesn't
o-o
the economy

work for

o-o
like me?
sentence-next
o-o
The numbers lie.
sentence-next
o-o
They say
o-o
everything's

hunky dory.
sentence-next
o-o
Is this an example
o-o
of mathiness?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I don't know what
o-o
mathiness is.
sentence-next
o-o
But numbers can
o-o
be deceptive.
sentence-next
o-o
What many people
o-o
overlook is that
o-o
the unemployment
o-o
rate that's in the news
o-o
just counts people
o-o
who are now getting
o-o
unemployment
o-o
benefits.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Those benefits
o-o
run out after a
o-o
few months of having
o-o
no job. I've learned
o-o
that from
o-o
experience.
sentence-next
o-o
So unemployment
o-o
is actually higher,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, it's higher.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why don't economists
o-o
measure that?
sentence-next
o-o
The real unemployment
o-o
rate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The government
o-o
does measure that
o-o
as well.
sentence-next
o-o
But most
o-o
newspapers and
o-o
TV stations
o-o
report the
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate
o-o
that
o-o
government
o-o
officials call
o-o
attention to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since wealthy
o-o
business owners
o-o
own news sources,
o-o
they probably
o-o
tell their
o-o
reporters
o-o
to report the
o-o
lower rate.
sentence-next
o-o
That gives
o-o
consumers
o-o
confidence
o-o
to spend dollars
o-o
more freely
o-o
at businesses
o-o
that advertise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought it was
o-o
just the
o-o
government
o-o
being sneaky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's both.
sentence-next
o-o
The government
o-o
knows if they
o-o
call attention
o-o
to the higher
o-o
actual
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate,
o-o
consumers
o-o
will have less
o-o
optimism.
sentence-next
o-o
When there's
o-o
less optimism,
o-o
consumers
o-o
spend less money.
sentence-next
o-o
That loops
o-o
back through
o-o
businesses
o-o
to fewer jobs
o-o
and lower
o-o
salaries
o-o
for other
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
Who then spend
o-o
less money.
sentence-next
o-o
That's a powerful
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So this loop
o-o
between optimism
o-o
and consumption
o-o
is like
o-o
your pupper
o-o
super poop
o-o
scooper loop?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a different

kind of
o-o
feedback loop.

Without caring

what

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
Dog owners,
o-o
the pooper

scooper ones,
o-o
care how many
o-o
piles of dog poop
o-o
their dog
o-o
can sniff.
sentence-next
o-o
But that's
o-o
affected by
o-o
other dog

sentence-next
o-o
There's no

benefit

to poop

don't scoop

too.

Feedback loops

use to get

oversized slices

sentence-next
o-o
They use lawyers.
sentence-next
o-o

news sources.

And they use money
o-o
to exploit
o-o
elections
o-o
in ways that
o-o
control
o-o
politicians.
sentence-next
o-o
They use
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to give themselves
o-o
bigger

slices of

cherry pie.
sentence-next
o-o

And

discouraging.

o-o

Is there even

any hope the big

Like global

end-lyric

Back when horses

big cities faced

a big environmental

Yet that didn't

happen.
sentence-next

Not one bit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They failed

automobiles

So our current

is like being

end-lyric

You've mentioned

low salaries.
sentence-next

Those will rise

when businesses

a well hyphen-here designed

tax break.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What would that
o-o
look like?
sentence-next
o-o
How will it work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Some kinds of
o-o
businesses
o-o
will get
o-o
a big extra
o-o
tax credit
o-o
if their
o-o
salary gap
o-o
between
o-o
managers
o-o
and workers
o-o
is lower
o-o
than most other
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would give
o-o
consumers more
o-o
spending money.
sentence-next
o-o
And that would fuel

a feedback loop

other

sentence-next

Right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed it would.

Is there a way

to measure
o-o
that wage gap?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sure,
o-o
just average
o-o
the salaries
o-o
below the median,
o-o
and the salaries
o-o
above the median,
o-o
subtract them,

and divide by the

minimum wage.

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's also
o-o
a math word.
sentence-next
o-o
Here it means the

half hyphen-here way
o-o
salary.
sentence-next
o-o
So he's saying
o-o
to split the employees
o-o
into two groups
o-o
of equal size.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A small number
o-o
for the wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
index
o-o
means managers
o-o
and executives
o-o
are sharing
o-o
more of the profits
o-o
with their employees
o-o
who get the
o-o
lower salaries.
sentence-next
o-o
So those businesses
o-o
get rewarded

with a bigger

tax break.
