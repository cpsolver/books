Knowing begin-italics what end-italics will

Professors

by knowing the

Economists

This explains why

why doesn't

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What many people
o-o
overlook is that
o-o
the unemployment

rate
o-o
that's in the news
o-o
just counts people

who are now getting

unemployment

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Those benefits
o-o
run out after a

no job. I've learned
o-o
that from

experience.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The government

the actual

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
if news sources

reported
o-o
the higher

o-o
they would earn

less money

It's both.

o-o
The government

knows if they

call attention
o-o
to the higher

actual

unemployment
o-o
rate,
o-o
consumers
o-o
will have less

optimism.
sentence-next
o-o
When there's
o-o
less optimism,
o-o
consumers

spend less money.
sentence-next
o-o
That loops

back through

businesses

less money.
sentence-next
o-o
That's a

powerful

feedback loop.
end-lyric

In a dog owner

The meat kind.

low salaries.

significantly
o-o
when businesses

a well hyphen-here designed

It would be

the company's

What would that

look like?

How will it work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Some kinds of

salary gap

between
o-o
managers

than most other

businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would give

consumers more

other

Right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed it would.

I'd like to see!
sentence-next
o-o
Is there a way

that wage gap?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sure,
o-o
just average
o-o
the salaries
o-o
below the median,

o-o
above the median,

subtract them,

salary.
sentence-next

So he's saying
o-o
to split the employees

into two groups

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A small number
o-o
for the wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
index
o-o
means managers

o-o
are sharing
o-o
more of the profits
o-o
with their employees
o-o
who get the

lower salaries.
sentence-next

So those businesses

get rewarded
