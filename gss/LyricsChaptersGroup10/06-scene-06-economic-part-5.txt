That's not quite right.

The banking

Most importantly

the

Higher levels

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You've got it!
sentence-next
o-o
One last bit
o-o
here is that
o-o
America
o-o
was far away

from big

armies

and navies.
sentence-next
o-o
That allowed
o-o
democracy

a place to grow.

And a place

America's

They saw the

sentence-next
o-o
And competition

the teamwork

Ah, employees

Oh, and Republicans

So fighting

cooperation

In the past,

high levels

However that
