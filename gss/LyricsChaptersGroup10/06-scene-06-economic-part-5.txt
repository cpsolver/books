So the

Protestant
o-o
religions
o-o
ended
o-o
the Italian
o-o
Renaissance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not quite right.
sentence-next
o-o
The economic
o-o
reforms that
o-o
created the
o-o
efficiency
o-o
of the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance
o-o
have spread
o-o
around the world.
sentence-next
o-o
In the meantime
o-o
Italy is still
o-o
unwinding
o-o
other kinds of
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
The same slow
o-o
progress is
o-o
happening
o-o
in Greece
o-o
and Spain
o-o
and Portugal.
sentence-next
o-o
Those
o-o
economies
o-o
are still weak
o-o
compared to
o-o
Germany,
o-o
France, and
o-o
Britain
o-o
where there
o-o
is less
o-o
of some kinds of
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Organized
o-o
crime
o-o
is still strong
o-o
in Italy
o-o
and elsewhere.
sentence-next
o-o
But name-econhist-nickname
o-o
can't say that part
o-o
out loud
o-o
because he could
o-o
lose more than just

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Most importantly
o-o
the
o-o
economic
o-o
success
o-o
in
o-o
America
o-o
exposed
o-o
Europe's
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And revealed
o-o
that democracy
o-o
has less
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
I'm seeing
o-o
the pattern.
sentence-next
o-o
Higher levels
o-o
of democracy
o-o
yield less
o-o
corruption,
o-o
which causes
o-o
less waste,
o-o
which increases
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which increases
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which yields
o-o
much better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
sentence-next
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You've got it!
sentence-next
o-o
One last bit
o-o
here is that
o-o
America
o-o
was far away
o-o
from big
o-o
armies
o-o
and navies.
sentence-next
o-o
That allowed
o-o
democracy
o-o
a place to grow.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Without
o-o
the burden
o-o
of church
o-o
taxation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That success
o-o
created
o-o
jealousy in
o-o
Europeans.
sentence-next
o-o
Eventually
o-o
they formed the
o-o
European
o-o
Union.
sentence-next
o-o
After
o-o
Catholics and
o-o
Protestants
o-o
stopped fighting
o-o
one another
o-o
on battlefields.
sentence-next
o-o
Except in
o-o
northern
o-o
Ireland.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And they stopped
o-o
having food fights
o-o
about table
o-o
etiquette.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the French,
o-o
Italians,
o-o
and Germans
o-o
stopped
o-o
fighting over
o-o
language
o-o
supremacy
o-o
when they saw
o-o
the inferior
o-o
English
o-o
language was
o-o
winning that
o-o
fight.
sentence-next
o-o
So basically
o-o
they're copying
o-o
the clear
o-o
economic
o-o
success of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
that works so well
o-o
in the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute.
sentence-next
o-o
You said warfare
o-o
undermines the
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet political hawks,
o-o
who are mostly
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
promote warfare
o-o
as a way to
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
sentence-next
o-o
And competition
o-o
between
o-o
nations,
o-o
and between
o-o
businesses,
o-o
is the basis
o-o
of prosperity
o-o
in a free market,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm lost.
sentence-next
o-o
I feel like I'm
o-o
in a maze and
o-o
someone turned off
o-o
the lights.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Competition
o-o
between
o-o
businesses
o-o
provides
o-o
motivation
o-o
to work hard.
sentence-next
o-o
But what gets
o-o
overlooked is
o-o
the teamwork
o-o
among
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
That cooperation
o-o
yields
o-o
efficiency.
sentence-next
o-o
The same kind of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
happens among
o-o
citizens
o-o
within the same
o-o
nation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hmm.
sentence-next
o-o
So teamwork
o-o
is more than
o-o
touchy hyphen-here feely
o-o
games?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, employees
o-o
getting along,
o-o
who wouldn't
o-o
normally get along.
sentence-next
o-o
Like employees
o-o
ignoring
o-o
racial differences,
o-o
religious
o-o
differences,
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, and Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
ignoring their
o-o
differences
o-o
while at work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see!
sentence-next
o-o
When these
o-o
conflicts
o-o
are ignored,
o-o
that's cooperation.
sentence-next
o-o
And that increases
o-o
efficiency
o-o
begin-italics within end-italics
o-o
the business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So cooperation
o-o
within a business
o-o
makes the business
o-o
strong.
sentence-next
o-o
So it can better
o-o
compete against
o-o
other
o-o
businesses?
sentence-next
o-o
The lights are
o-o
coming back on.
sentence-next
o-o
I think I see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So fighting
o-o
between groups
o-o
of people
o-o
inspires,
o-o
motivates,
o-o
cooperation
o-o
within each
o-o
group?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not a bad
o-o
simplification.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And a lack
o-o
of cooperation
o-o
is why
o-o
climate change
o-o
is turning
o-o
our planet
o-o
into toast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In the past,
o-o
higher levels
o-o
of cooperation
o-o
came from
o-o
churches and
o-o
religions.
sentence-next
o-o
They originated
o-o
public schools,
o-o
hospitals,
o-o
food for the poor,
o-o
orphanages,
o-o
and
o-o
uplifting
o-o
songs.
sentence-next
o-o
But
o-o
climate change
o-o
is a topic

end-lyric

Religions
o-o
can be good?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Ancient priests
o-o
in Egypt earned
o-o
their grain and beer
o-o
by predicting
o-o
eclipses
o-o
so their boss,
o-o
the pharaoh,
o-o
could pretend

to be powerful.
sentence-next
o-o
And they
o-o
predicted
o-o
when the Nile

River would

flood and recede.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus each year
o-o
priests used

mathematics

to lay out

that year's

farming

boundaries.

skills.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
During the

European

black death,
o-o
priests lost more

credibility

sentence-next
o-o
They lost their lives

by praying

And their
