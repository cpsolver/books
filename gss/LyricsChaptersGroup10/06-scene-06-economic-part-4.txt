ambee sings-damien amenn
Since efficiency
o-o
is so important,
o-o
economists
o-o
measure it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
They think they do.
sentence-next
o-o
They have
o-o
something
o-o
called the
o-o
productivity
o-o
index.
sentence-next
o-o
But it's flawed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
sentence-next
o-o
You do remember
o-o
some economics.
sentence-next
o-o
The productivity
o-o
index
o-o
is supposed to
o-o
measure
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which is similar
o-o
to efficiency.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet that index
o-o
increases
o-o
when a house
o-o
burns down
o-o
and then
o-o
inexpensively
o-o
gets rebuilt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course it
o-o
would be even
o-o
more efficient
o-o
if the house
o-o
never burned down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Measuring
o-o
non hyphen-here destruction,
o-o
alas that's not
o-o
a sexy topic
o-o
that attracts
o-o
economists'
o-o
attention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And that index
o-o
fails to
o-o
account for
o-o
the benefits
o-o
of unpaid
o-o
volunteers
o-o
working in
o-o
public
o-o
libraries.
sentence-next
o-o
And the delayed
o-o
benefits
o-o
of better
o-o
public
o-o
education.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if efficiency
o-o
is what made the
o-o
Roman empire
o-o
great,
o-o
why did it
o-o
decline?
sentence-next
o-o
In just a
o-o
sentence or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If all the books
o-o
on this subject
o-o
fell on you,
o-o
you'd get buried
o-o
in an avalanche
o-o
ten feet high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'll try to
o-o
oversimplify.
sentence-next
o-o
After the years of
o-o
good governance
o-o
and
o-o
prosperity,
o-o
new kinds of
o-o
corruption grew.
sentence-next
o-o
And they ran out of
o-o
distant places
o-o
conquer
o-o
and plunder.
sentence-next
o-o
And those
o-o
better roads
o-o
led to
o-o
pandemics.
sentence-next
o-o
That's basically
o-o
the kids' book
o-o
version of the
o-o
Roman empire.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's the economic
o-o
opposite
o-o
of corruption?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This is going
o-o
to take awhile.
sentence-next
o-o
What I'm wearing
o-o
will go
o-o
out of style.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
multiple
o-o
opposites
o-o
because there are
o-o
multiple
o-o
kinds of
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet in a sense
o-o
the opposite is
o-o
the free market.
sentence-next
o-o
You know what that is,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I know it's not
o-o
a store with signs
o-o
sayin' everything
o-o
is free.
sentence-next
o-o
But I can't
o-o
define it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
An ideal
o-o
free market
o-o
happens when
o-o
people are free
o-o
to choose
o-o
what to buy,
o-o
what to sell,
o-o
how much to charge,
o-o
and whatever else,
o-o
without fighting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'd fight for that!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A fully
o-o
free market
o-o
is flexible
o-o
and very
o-o
efficient.
o-o
And it's
o-o
impossible.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet we can get
o-o
much closer
o-o
than where
o-o
we are now.
sentence-next
o-o
But we need to
o-o
remove corrupt
o-o
artificial
o-o
boundaries
o-o
that channel
o-o
money into
o-o
specific
o-o
pockets.
sentence-next
o-o
Centuries ago
o-o
those kinds of
o-o
corruption
o-o
included
o-o
nepotism,
o-o
bribery,
o-o
racketeering,
o-o
guilds,
o-o
secret
o-o
societies,
o-o
fraternal
o-o
organizations,
o-o
black markets,
o-o
basing
o-o
the economy
o-o
on trading favors,
o-o
and murdering
o-o
political enemies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's
o-o
nepo...
sentence-next
o-o
whatever.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nepotism
o-o
is hiring
o-o
family
o-o
members.
sentence-next
o-o
And friends.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So looking
o-o
at Facebook
o-o
friends as
o-o
job candidates
o-o
isn't allowed.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm glad of that.
sentence-next
o-o
But is there really
o-o
less beer drinking
o-o
in frat houses
o-o
compared to
o-o
the past?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not that kind of
o-o
fraternal
o-o
organization.
sentence-next
o-o
I'll explain that
o-o
later.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Also explain
o-o
later about
o-o
trading favors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That part I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
myself.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Trading favors
o-o
is what they do
o-o
in places like
o-o
Russia.
sentence-next
o-o
Where the
o-o
rule of law
o-o
often
o-o
doesn't rule.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Donald Trump
o-o
hides his taxes.
sentence-next
o-o
They would reveal
o-o
his big debt to
o-o
Russian
o-o
oligarchs,
o-o
arranged as
o-o
a favor
o-o
by Vladimir
o-o
Putin.
sentence-next
o-o
Trump began
o-o
to return
o-o
the favor
o-o
on his first day
o-o
in the
o-o
White House,
o-o
by blocking
o-o
Congressional
o-o
aid to Ukraine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That explains
o-o
what's been puttin'
o-o
a big smile
o-o
on Putin,
o-o
after he meets with
o-o
Trump.
sentence-next
o-o
Thank goodness,
o-o
outside the
o-o
White House,
o-o
and Congress,
o-o
the rule of law
o-o
mostly
o-o
still works here.
sentence-next
o-o
Even in
o-o
New Jersey.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On weekdays.
sentence-next
o-o
In daylight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Well,
o-o
I think I'm
o-o
gettin' the
o-o
general idea.
sentence-next
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
and stealing from
o-o
foreigners,
o-o
or selling to
o-o
foreigners,
o-o
is what brings
o-o
money into
o-o
a region.
sentence-next
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which causes
o-o
economic
o-o
decline.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a bit
o-o
fuzzy but ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My butt's fuzzy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If you say so.
sentence-next
o-o
I can see
o-o
it's firm.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A similar kind of
o-o
rise and fall
o-o
pattern happened
o-o
later with the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
sentence-next
o-o
It started with
o-o
efficient banking
o-o
between cities.
sentence-next
o-o
That put yet more
o-o
highway robbers
o-o
out of
o-o
business.
sentence-next
o-o
And it financed
o-o
improved ships
o-o
with better
o-o
navigation.
sentence-next
o-o
Using technology
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The compass,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the ship's
o-o
rudder.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Of course
o-o
gunpowder.
sentence-next
o-o
And did that
o-o
better banking
o-o
use the digits
o-o
zero through nine
o-o
that came from
o-o
the Chinese
o-o
abacus?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You're astute!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No my ass
o-o
didn't toot!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Astute.
sentence-next
o-o
It means your brain
o-o
just did the
o-o
equivalent of
o-o
a gymnastics
o-o
triple twist
o-o
vault
o-o
with a perfect
o-o
landing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh thanks!
sentence-next
o-o
So what kind of
o-o
corruption
o-o
ended the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of the wealth
o-o
going to Rome
o-o
came from
o-o
churches
o-o
around Europe
o-o
that heavily
o-o
taxed their
o-o
members.
sentence-next
o-o
That wealth
o-o
is still visible
o-o
today in the
o-o
Vatican City.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which is
o-o
inside
o-o
Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Even I've
o-o
heard about
o-o
the porn painted
o-o
on the ceiling
o-o
of a chapel
o-o
in Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the
o-o
Sistine Chapel
o-o
painted by
o-o
Michelangelo.
sentence-next
o-o
A second
o-o
artist
o-o
covered the
o-o
private parts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Those church taxes,
o-o
especially
o-o
indulgences,
o-o
were so corrupt
o-o
and oppressive
o-o
that Martin Luther
o-o
and others
o-o
created the
o-o
Protestant
o-o
revolution,
o-o
which led to
o-o
creating
o-o
new religions,
o-o
including
o-o
the Church
o-o
of England.
o-o
The Pilgrims who
o-o
settled the
o-o
Plymouth
o-o
Plantation
o-o
were escaping
o-o
from those
o-o
oppressive
o-o
church
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do fewer
o-o
rich people
o-o
really hold back
o-o
on indulgences
o-o
for wine,
o-o
potato chips,
o-o
and foot
o-o
massages?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not those kinds
o-o
of indulgences.
sentence-next
o-o
These were
o-o
documents
o-o
of forgiveness
o-o
purchased from
o-o
the church.
sentence-next
o-o
The point is
o-o
money flowing
o-o
into Rome
o-o
from Catholic
o-o
churches
o-o
dried up
o-o
because the popes
o-o
got way
o-o
too greedy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back then
o-o
freedom of
o-o
religion
o-o
was about money,
o-o
not just beliefs.
sentence-next
o-o
And beliefs
o-o
and money
o-o
intertwined,
o-o
such as the ban
o-o
on abortions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the link
o-o
between money
o-o
and abortions?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Less abortions
o-o
yielded bigger
o-o
congregations
o-o
buying off
o-o
more sins
o-o
and sending
o-o
yet more money
o-o
to the Vatican.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Plus
o-o
abortions
o-o
of males
o-o
diminished
o-o
the size
o-o
of the king's
o-o
son's army.
sentence-next
o-o
That could affect
o-o
winning or losing
o-o
fights,
o-o
which was the
o-o
basis for
o-o
economic
o-o
gains and
o-o
losses.
end-lyric
