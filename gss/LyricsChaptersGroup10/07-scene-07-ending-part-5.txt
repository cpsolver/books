So who's going to
o-o
believe this nonsense
o-o
that different ballots
o-o
and different ways
o-o
of counting votes
o-o
is really going
o-o
to make things better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This situation
o-o
is like when women
o-o
demanded the right

to vote.
sentence-next
o-o
A few places,
o-o
like Canada,
o-o
Australia, and
o-o
New Zealand,
o-o
tried it.
sentence-next
o-o
Then a few western
o-o
states tried it.
sentence-next
o-o
The predicted
o-o
disasters didn't
o-o
follow,
o-o
so it was
o-o
adopted
o-o
throughout the
o-o
United States.
sentence-next
o-o
And don't you think
o-o
it's made things better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Sometimes I wonder.
sentence-next
o-o
We don't seem to be
o-o
doing that well now
o-o
that women have
o-o
taken over.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Without Rosie
o-o
the riveters
o-o
working in factories
o-o
during the war years
o-o
U.S. soldiers
o-o
and England
o-o
might have lost.
sentence-next
o-o
And a woman in
o-o
the White House
o-o
couldn't possibly
o-o
be worse than
o-o
the ancient males
o-o
we've been getting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Getting back to
o-o
makers and
o-o
takers,
o-o
name-vc
o-o
do you see
o-o
that tax breaks
o-o
for small maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
will increase sales
o-o
at taker
o-o
businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I admit I do.
o-o
I hadn't
o-o
noticed this
o-o
distinction.
sentence-next
o-o
I can see
o-o
those small maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
including
o-o
restaurants
o-o
that attract
o-o
tourists,
o-o
don't have time
o-o
to lobby for
o-o
these tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And there's another
o-o
tax break
o-o
that will help
o-o
improve the
o-o
local economy.
sentence-next
o-o
It will go to
o-o
businesses
o-o
that have a
o-o
smaller wage gap
o-o
compared to
o-o
typical
o-o
businesses
o-o
that underpay
o-o
the workers
o-o
who do the work
o-o
that customers
o-o
pay for.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The wage gap is
o-o
between your
o-o
better hyphen-here paid
o-o
employees
o-o
and your
o-o
lower hyphen-here wage
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
That gap
o-o
gets smaller
o-o
by increasing
o-o
the wages of
o-o
employees
o-o
at the bottom
o-o
of the business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You want me
o-o
to tighten my belt,
o-o
not just on me,
o-o
but on my business.
sentence-next
o-o
Yeah I've gotten
o-o
to be too fat,
o-o
which is why
o-o
I'm here.
sentence-next
o-o
Maybe my
o-o
business
o-o
also would be
o-o
healthier
o-o
if I shared
o-o
some of my income
o-o
with all my
o-o
employees,
o-o
not just the ones
o-o
in management.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And pardon
o-o
my boldness
o-o
but maybe that
o-o
will make it
o-o
easier to hire
o-o
and retain
o-o
the best 
o-o
employees.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The ones who do
o-o
the work
o-o
your customers
o-o
write about
o-o
on social
o-o
media.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That might lessen
o-o
the load on
o-o
management.
sentence-next
o-o
After all,
o-o
better paid
o-o
employees
o-o
need fewer
o-o
incentives
o-o
and fewer rules.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And fewer
o-o
verbal spankings
o-o
from the human
o-o
resources
o-o
department.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Don't get any
o-o
socialistic
o-o
notions about
o-o
telling me
o-o
to pay my
o-o
employees more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not that I care
o-o
about income
o-o
for your business,
o-o
but a wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
tax break
o-o
might reduce
o-o
the taxes
o-o
your business
o-o
pays.
sentence-next
o-o
And you might get
o-o
sued less
o-o
if you cared more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Hmm,
o-o
this seems
o-o
to relate to
o-o
what you said
o-o
earlier
o-o
father,
o-o
I mean name-minister no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
You said shortcuts
o-o
to earn
o-o
more money
o-o
typically

increase

suffering

for others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Churches now
o-o
provide hot meals
o-o
and clothing
o-o
to those who
o-o
cannot afford
o-o
the basics.
sentence-next
o-o
When they can get
o-o
better hyphen-here paying jobs
o-o
we won't need to
o-o
offer as much
o-o
assistance
o-o
to the needy.
sentence-next
o-o
So this is yet
o-o
another way
o-o
churches might lose
o-o
even more of
o-o
our influence.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I'm in favor
o-o
of this reform!
sentence-next
o-o
People with jobs
o-o
surely deserve
o-o
hot meals and warmth
o-o
without assistance
o-o
from churches
o-o
or government.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Plus,
o-o
more of the money
o-o
will go into
o-o
the local

sentence-next
o-o
Remember
o-o
women tend
o-o
to choose jobs
o-o
where they can help
o-o
children,
o-o
nurse folks
o-o
to better health,
o-o
help
o-o
customers,
o-o
and
o-o
sell toy
o-o
dinosaurs.
sentence-next
o-o
Currently
o-o
those jobs pay less.
sentence-next
o-o
When those women
o-o
earn more,
o-o
they'll spend
o-o
more of it
o-o
doing good things
o-o
for their family
o-o
and the
o-o
community.
sentence-next
That's way better
o-o
than managers
o-o
and executives
o-o
buying bigger 
o-o
fishing boats,
o-o
paying for
o-o
hunting trips,
o-o
and buying
o-o
stupid lingerie
o-o
as if that
o-o
compensates
o-o
for their failure
o-o
to understand
o-o
what wives want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And there will be
o-o
fewer strikes
o-o
by workers.
sentence-next
o-o
And fewer voters
o-o
pushing for,
o-o
what's that called,
o-o
something like
o-o
guaranteed income?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Universal basic income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Finally
o-o
we agree
o-o
on something.
sentence-next
o-o
That idea doesn't
o-o
deserve to
o-o
exist.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it wouldn't
o-o
be getting
o-o
attention
o-o
if business
o-o
owners reduced
o-o
the wage gap.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember
o-o
capitalism
o-o
is about supply
o-o
and demand.
sentence-next
o-o
When you supply
o-o
better hyphen-here paying jobs
o-o
there will be lots
o-o
of demand
o-o
for those jobs
o-o
so you'll get
o-o
better hyphen-here qualified
o-o
applicants.
sentence-next
o-o
In other words
o-o
tax credits can
o-o
incentivize
o-o
what the

compassion.
end-lyric

Translating

the Dalai Lama's

This is why,
o-o
with the
o-o
worlds of business
o-o
and government
o-o
recently
o-o
declining
o-o
in ethics,
o-o
we the voters
o-o
need to fight
o-o
for fairness!
sentence-next
o-o
That fairness
o-o
means less
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And wiser
o-o
elected politicians
o-o
will give us
o-o
the wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
tax break,
o-o
and the tax break
o-o
for small maker
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
The reduced
o-o
corruption,
o-o
and the increased
o-o
efficiency
o-o
in the economy,
o-o
will bring us
o-o
widespread
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
So is fairness
o-o
or economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
more important
o-o
to you?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why can't we
o-o
get both?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Getting to the
o-o
point, do you want

to earn more money
o-o
so we can afford

maybe a few

luxuries in life?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to build
o-o
a business that

sentence-next
o-o
My original
o-o
plan was to

manufacture
o-o
my leaf gutter
o-o
cleaning tool
o-o
so that fewer

ladders
o-o
when cleaning their

sentence-next
o-o
Yet lately,
o-o
other inventions

Most are for the

someone told us

about.
end-lyric

Your mind is in

None of that

Mmm, I'm

beginning

value of

if it gets

taxed less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And fewer toes

doing food prep.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As a

a kitchen

sounds useful.
sentence-next

Especially
o-o
now that
o-o
ordering takeout
o-o
will be rare,
o-o
ice cream
o-o
is no longer

automating

the prepping of

apples,

carrots,

oranges,

and such

will save time.
