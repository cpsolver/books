The Islamic

What does Islam
o-o
have to do with
o-o
innovation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A few centuries
o-o
after the height
o-o
of the
o-o
Roman Empire,
o-o
the new religion
o-o
of Islam
o-o
spread through
o-o
the Middle East
o-o
and northern
o-o
Africa.
sentence-next
o-o
That huge region,
o-o
all reading
o-o
and writing
o-o
Arabic,
o-o
gave that empire
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Unlike the

their holy book,

the Qur'an,

in Arabic.

Harun al hyphen-here Rashid,

non hyphen-here fiction books
o-o
and recruited

wise scholars
o-o
from around the

known world.
sentence-next

They developed
o-o
innovations
o-o
we now know as
o-o
algebra,
o-o
geometry,
o-o
medicine,
o-o
three D drawings,
o-o
robotic mechanisms,
o-o
paper making,
o-o
and new

Those innovations

gave Muslims

prosperity.

Is that when
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
made its way
o-o
closer to Europe?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yup.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why
o-o
Europeans
o-o
and we refer
o-o
to the digits
o-o
zero through nine
o-o
as Arabic
o-o
numerals.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Under later
o-o
rulers,
o-o
corruption
o-o
increased.
sentence-next
o-o
And science
o-o
stopped being
o-o
valued.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus Islam
o-o
has split into
o-o
two factions
o-o
that fight
o-o
each other.
sentence-next
o-o
That's basically
o-o
why that golden
o-o
age declined.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That decline
o-o
sounds familiar.
sentence-next
o-o
With what's
o-o
going on now.
sentence-next
o-o
In the
o-o
United States.
sentence-next
o-o
How come
o-o
stupidity
o-o
so often wins

Dictators

When Mao Zedong

lots of books.
sentence-next
o-o
And he banished

intellectuals
o-o
to manual hyphen-here labor

jobs.
sentence-next
o-o
That undermined
o-o
the economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Chinese spies
o-o
have needed to
o-o
steal secrets
o-o
of technology
o-o
from us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since
o-o
Europeans
o-o
got lots of
o-o
inventions
o-o
from China,
o-o
did earlier
o-o
Chinese rulers
o-o
do better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
economically.
sentence-next
o-o
They used
o-o
written exams
o-o
to fill
o-o
government jobs.
sentence-next
o-o
That way of
o-o
avoiding
o-o
nepotism
o-o
was practical
o-o
because
o-o
the Chinese
o-o
used a
o-o
single writing

system.
sentence-next
o-o
The abacus

o-o
These were big

advantages
o-o
over other
o-o
empires.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since innovations
o-o
are good,
o-o
does this mean
o-o
we need more
o-o
innovative
o-o
politicians
o-o
like Bernie
o-o
Sanders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Whoa!
sentence-next
o-o
Innovation
o-o
isn't about just
o-o
doing things
o-o
differently.
sentence-next
o-o
Bernie Sanders
o-o
is different
o-o
from mainstream
o-o
politicians
o-o
because he
o-o
points to
o-o
economic
o-o
suffering
o-o
of young people
o-o
like you two.
sentence-next
o-o
Mainstream
o-o
politicians,
o-o
on both left
o-o
and right,
o-o
try to hide,
o-o
not advertise,
o-o
that suffering
o-o
because it makes
o-o
the mainstream
o-o
parties
o-o
look bad.
sentence-next
o-o
But Sanders
o-o
promotes
o-o
socialism,
o-o
which is not
o-o
innovation.
sentence-next
o-o
And socialism
o-o
isn't a
o-o
solution
o-o
because it yields
o-o
corruption
o-o
that's worse
o-o
than the
o-o
corruption
o-o
under
o-o
capitalism.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't the
o-o
cooperation
o-o
of socialism
o-o
better than the
o-o
competition of
o-o
capitalism?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
No.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember that
o-o
cooperation
o-o
is the very
o-o
foundation of
o-o
capitalism.
sentence-next
o-o
Capitalism
o-o
is based on
o-o
buyers
o-o
and sellers
o-o
cooperating
o-o
based on
o-o
supply and
o-o
demand.
sentence-next
o-o
What you dislike
o-o
is the addition

of corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
in my fight
o-o
against
o-o
corruption,
o-o
I've been
o-o
overlooking
o-o
cooperation.
sentence-next
o-o
Within
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
And within
o-o
nations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Socialism
o-o
attempts to

control
o-o
markets
o-o
from the top down
o-o
using
o-o
quotas,
o-o
penalties,
o-o
subsidies,

price controls,

and other kinds of

law hyphen-here based
o-o
transfers

of money.
sentence-next
o-o
It's like
o-o
housing
o-o
associations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Lots of
o-o
passive
o-o
aggressive
o-o
manipulation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of rules
o-o
and constraints
o-o
followed by
o-o
complaints.
sentence-next
o-o
In a nation,
o-o
those who suffer
o-o
can't move out.
sentence-next
o-o
So they adopt
o-o
workarounds.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as gangs,
o-o
black markets,
o-o
drug cartels,
o-o
organized crime,
o-o
trading favors,
o-o
nepotism,
o-o
and
o-o
military coups.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So a free and
o-o
efficient
o-o
market's like
o-o
letting water
o-o
find its own way
o-o
to the ocean?
sentence-next
o-o
And socialism
o-o
is like trying
o-o
to redirect
o-o
the
o-o
Mississippi
o-o
River
o-o
to flow through
o-o
Texas
o-o
instead of
o-o
Louisiana?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a useful
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of
o-o
socialists and
o-o
communists
o-o
start out with
o-o
good intentions.
sentence-next
o-o
But those get
o-o
corrupted
o-o
by the greedy
o-o
and selfish.
sentence-next
o-o
Like the pigs

That's a

revolution

evolving into

pig dictatorship.
sentence-next
o-o
I think
o-o
I'm getting
o-o
your point.
sentence-next
o-o
Capitalism
o-o
is sometimes bad,
o-o
but it doesn't
o-o
have to be bad.
sentence-next
o-o
And everything
o-o
ends with corruption
o-o
if we let it.
sentence-next
o-o
And improving
o-o
democracy
o-o
is our best hope
o-o
for a fair

economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Excellent,
o-o
yes!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm curious.

What are the
