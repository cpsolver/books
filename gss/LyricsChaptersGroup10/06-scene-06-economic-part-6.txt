Since innovations
o-o
are good,
o-o
does this mean
o-o
we need more
o-o
innovative
o-o
politicians
o-o
like Bernie
o-o
Sanders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Whoa!
sentence-next
o-o
Innovation
o-o
isn't about just
o-o
doing things
o-o
differently.
sentence-next
o-o
Bernie Sanders
o-o
is different
o-o
from mainstream
o-o
politicians
o-o
because he
o-o
points to
o-o
economic
o-o
suffering
o-o
of young people
o-o
like you two.
sentence-next
o-o
Mainstream
o-o
politicians,
o-o
on both left
o-o
and right,
o-o
try to hide,
o-o
not advertise,
o-o
that suffering
o-o
because it makes
o-o
the mainstream
o-o
parties
o-o
look bad.
sentence-next
o-o
But Sanders
o-o
promotes
o-o
socialism,
o-o
which is not
o-o
innovation.
sentence-next
o-o
And socialism
o-o
isn't a
o-o
solution
o-o
because it yields
o-o
corruption
o-o
that's worse
o-o
than the
o-o
corruption
o-o
under
o-o
capitalism.

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't the
o-o
cooperation
o-o
of socialism
o-o
better than the
o-o
competition of
o-o
capitalism?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
No.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember that
o-o
cooperation
o-o
is the very
o-o
foundation of
o-o
capitalism.
sentence-next
o-o
Capitalism
o-o
is based on
o-o
buyers
o-o
and sellers
o-o
cooperating
o-o
based on
o-o
supply and
o-o
demand.
sentence-next
o-o
What you dislike
o-o
is the addition
o-o
of corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
in my fight
o-o
against
o-o
corruption,
o-o
I've been
o-o
overlooking
o-o
cooperation.
sentence-next
o-o
Within
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
And within
o-o
nations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Socialism
o-o
attempts to
o-o
control
o-o
markets
o-o
from the top down
o-o
using
o-o
quotas,
o-o
penalties,
o-o
subsidies,
o-o
price controls,
o-o
and other kinds of
o-o
law hyphen-here based
o-o
transfers
o-o
of money.
sentence-next
o-o
Inevitably
o-o
those rules and
o-o
constraints
o-o
lead to suffering
o-o
and complaints.
sentence-next
o-o
Those who suffer
o-o
adopt
o-o
workarounds.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as gangs,
o-o
black markets,
o-o
drug cartels,
o-o
organized crime,
o-o
trading favors,
o-o
nepotism,
o-o
and
o-o
military coups.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So a free and
o-o
efficient
o-o
market's like
o-o
letting water
o-o
find its own way
o-o
to the ocean?
sentence-next
o-o
And socialism
o-o
is like trying
o-o
to redirect
o-o
the
o-o
Mississippi
o-o
River
o-o
to flow through
o-o
Texas
o-o
instead of
o-o
Louisiana?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a useful
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of
o-o
socialists and
o-o
communists
o-o
start out with
o-o
good intentions.
sentence-next
o-o
But those get
o-o
corrupted
o-o
by the greedy
o-o
and selfish.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So capitalism
o-o
is sometimes bad,
o-o
but it doesn't
o-o
have to be bad.
sentence-next
o-o
Everything
o-o
ends with corruption
o-o
if citizens
o-o
lose control of
o-o
government.
sentence-next
o-o
And improving
o-o
democracy
o-o
is our best hope
o-o
for a fair
o-o
and prosperous
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Excellent,
o-o
yes!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm curious.
sentence-next
o-o
What are the
o-o
innovations
o-o
related to
o-o
baking those
o-o
additional
o-o
savory pies?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I wanna know too!
