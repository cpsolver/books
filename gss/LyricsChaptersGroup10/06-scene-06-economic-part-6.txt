Is that when
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
made its way
o-o
closer to Europe?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes, and why

Europeans
o-o
and we refer

zero through nine
o-o
as Arabic
o-o
numerals.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus plus.
sentence-next

Later that empire

Corruption
o-o
I'll bet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
including
o-o
a dismissal
o-o
of science.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
People who
o-o
dismiss science
o-o
are doubly stupid.
sentence-next
o-o
And I'll bet
o-o
some of them
o-o
are capitalists

About

Since

Chinese emperors

What we call

the right to rule.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
they feared

natural

disasters.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
too many deaths

caused by flood,

o-o
or crop failure,
o-o
would lead to

rebellion and

is good.

Does this mean

we need more

innovative
o-o
politicians

like Bernie
o-o
Sanders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Whoa!
sentence-next
o-o
Innovation
o-o
isn't about just
o-o
doing things
o-o
differently.
sentence-next
o-o
Bernie Sanders
o-o
is different
o-o
from mainstream
o-o
politicians
o-o
because he
o-o
points to
o-o
economic
o-o
suffering
o-o
of young people
o-o
like you two.
sentence-next
o-o
Mainstream
o-o
politicians,
o-o
on both left
o-o
and right,
o-o
try to hide,
o-o
not advertise,
o-o
that suffering
o-o
because it makes
o-o
the mainstream
o-o
parties
o-o
look bad.
sentence-next
o-o
But Sanders
o-o
promotes
o-o
socialism,
o-o
which is not
o-o
innovation.
sentence-next
o-o
And socialism
o-o
isn't a
o-o
solution
o-o
because it yields
o-o
corruption
o-o
that's worse
o-o
than the
o-o
corruption
o-o
under
o-o
capitalism.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't the

cooperation

of socialism
o-o
better than the

competition of
o-o
capitalism?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
No.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember that
o-o
cooperation
o-o
is the very
o-o
foundation of
o-o
capitalism.
sentence-next
o-o
Capitalism
o-o
is based on
o-o
buyers

o-o
cooperating

based on

supply and
o-o
demand.
sentence-next
o-o
What you dislike
o-o
is the addition

of corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That makes sense
o-o
so far.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Socialism
o-o
attempts to

control
o-o
markets
o-o
from the top down

using

quotas,

penalties,

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Lots of
o-o
passive
o-o
aggressive
o-o
manipulation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of rules
o-o
and constraints.
sentence-next
o-o
Those yield
o-o
complaints
o-o
by people
o-o
not in power.
sentence-next
o-o
In a nation,
o-o
those who suffer
o-o
can't move out.
sentence-next
o-o
So they adopt
o-o
workarounds.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as gangs,
o-o
black markets,
o-o
drug cartels,
o-o
trading favors,
o-o
nepotism,
o-o
and
o-o
military coups
o-o
by wannabe
o-o
dictators.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So a free and
o-o
efficient
o-o
market's like
o-o
letting water
o-o
find its own way
o-o
to the ocean?
sentence-next
o-o
And socialism
o-o
is like trying
o-o
to redirect
o-o
the
o-o
Mississippi
o-o
River
o-o
to flow through
o-o
Texas
o-o
instead of
o-o
Louisiana?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a useful
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of
o-o
socialists and
o-o
communists
o-o
start out with
o-o
good intentions.
sentence-next
o-o
But those get

corrupted
o-o
by the greedy

o-o
Like the pigs

pig dictatorship.
sentence-next
o-o
I think
o-o
I'm getting
o-o
your point.
sentence-next
o-o
Capitalism
o-o
is sometimes bad,
o-o
but it doesn't
o-o
have to be bad.
sentence-next
o-o
And everything
o-o
ends with corruption
o-o
if we let it.
sentence-next
o-o
And improving
o-o
democracy
o-o
is our best hope
o-o
for a fair
o-o

economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Excellent,

yes!

ambee sings-damien amenn
How will higher

democracy
o-o
reduce

corruption?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Most voters

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Don't most voters

Because

everyone

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Dang,

you're right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
As a word

lots of those who

Do you know about

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I remember
o-o
his name

rhymes with

And he opposed

slavery.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow,
o-o
it sounds like
o-o
he was way
o-o
ahead of his time.
sentence-next
o-o
Did he make

much progress?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
He wrote

articles

o-o
criticizing
o-o
the

French
o-o
politicians
o-o
in power.
sentence-next

They put him

That level

anymore.
sentence-next

Except in
