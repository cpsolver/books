Can we call you

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sure,
o-o
that's better
o-o
than what
o-o
spellcheck
o-o
suggests.
o-o
Welcome to my
o-o
classroom.
o-o
Would you like some
o-o
pistachios?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm so
o-o
full of nuts
o-o
I could get a
o-o
dozen squirrels
o-o
through winter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We're wired on
o-o
espresso.
o-o
So let's go!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm hungry
o-o
to learn.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We came to learn
o-o
the dark arts
o-o
of economics.
o-o
Please tell us
o-o
what will happen
o-o
in the world
o-o
of money
o-o
when elections
o-o
are fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
When vote splittin's
o-o
no longer
o-o
skewing
o-o
the outcome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not goat
o-o
spitting.
o-o
It's vote
o-o
splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We know it's
o-o
super
o-o
challengin'
o-o
to predict
o-o
the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's mostly what
o-o
us economists
o-o
are paid to do.
o-o
Predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are they,
o-o
well you too,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
usually right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sometimes yes,
o-o
and then we
o-o
modestly say
o-o
begin-italics I told you so end-italics no-space .
o-o
Sometimes no,
o-o
and then we
o-o
apply for a
o-o
research grant
o-o
to study why
o-o
we were wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you get paid more
o-o
if you're wrong?
o-o
Do you own
o-o
a Tesla
o-o
and a home
o-o
that has a
o-o
panoramic
o-o
view?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
your espresso
o-o
is showing.
o-o
Professor,
o-o
do you have a
o-o
general notion
o-o
'bout what will
o-o
change?
o-o
Especially
o-o
in Washington.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course!
o-o
Lots of new laws
o-o
will be
o-o
passed.
o-o
Those laws
o-o
will reduce
o-o
corruption.
o-o
Then a few
o-o
people who
o-o
greatly profit
o-o
from existing
o-o
kinds of
o-o
corruption
o-o
might
o-o
temporarily
o-o
earn less money.
o-o
Almost everyone
o-o
else will enjoy
o-o
increased prosperity.
o-o
And that increase
o-o
later will feed back
o-o
to the ones who
o-o
temporarily
o-o
lost some of their
o-o
income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's your
o-o
justification?
o-o
For that prediction?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That trend has been
o-o
going on throughout
o-o
civilization
o-o
and history.
o-o
Not counting
o-o
setbacks
o-o
caused by
o-o
warfare.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can you
o-o
explain why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Imagine the economy
o-o
as a strawberry pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not fond of
o-o
strawberry pie.
o-o
And apple pie
o-o
is tasteless
o-o
to me as a
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
Can we make it
o-o
tastier
o-o
and fill it
o-o
with cherries?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course. Now
o-o
imagine the economy
o-o
is a cherry pie.
o-o
If some people
o-o
cut themselves
o-o
a slice that is
o-o
too big, then other
o-o
people end up with
o-o
smaller slices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm following this.
o-o
Wow!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What would you like
o-o
to call the people
o-o
who take too big
o-o
of a slice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
People in the
o-o
political down.
o-o
As opposed to the
o-o
political left
o-o
'n political
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'N we
o-o
the people,
o-o
who get too little,
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Bravo!
o-o
I'll bet you
o-o
had to struggle
o-o
to get your
o-o
bearings
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
jungle.
o-o
So,
o-o
the way I see it,
o-o
if elections
o-o
were fair,
o-o
then elected
o-o
leaders
o-o
would care
o-o
more about
o-o
the people
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up,
o-o
where most
o-o
of us are,
o-o
who get too little
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the part
o-o
we've figured
o-o
out.
o-o
And that
o-o
replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
wouldn't lie
o-o
...
o-o
as much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some
o-o
politicians
o-o
will be replaced.
o-o
The others who
o-o
continue to win
o-o
elections
o-o
will shift their
o-o
priorities
o-o
to better match
o-o
voters
o-o
instead of their
o-o
biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Makes sense.
o-o
Currently
o-o
they're
o-o
handcuffed.
o-o
The shift will
o-o
set them free
o-o
to do what we,
o-o
the majority
o-o
of voters want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
some will resist
o-o
reformation.
o-o
They'll
o-o
persist
o-o
in being
o-o
ass ...,
o-o
er,
o-o
jerks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here's
o-o
the answer
o-o
to your question.
o-o
The reformed
o-o
politicians
o-o
and replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
will pass laws
o-o
that give bigger
o-o
slices of
o-o
economic
o-o
pie
o-o
to the
o-o
majority
o-o
of voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So far
o-o
this is
o-o
easier
o-o
than playing
o-o
air guitar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When I took
o-o
economics
o-o
one oh one,
o-o
it wasn't
o-o
this fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We'll get to some
o-o
complicated
o-o
bits swiftly,
o-o
and they involve
o-o
bits of
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o
not silly
o-o
wonky
o-o
history.
o-o
I learned some.
o-o
But I'm done
o-o
with the past.
o-o
It's gone.
o-o
Why do people
o-o
dwell on that
o-o
old stuffy
o-o
stuff?
o-o
Other than
o-o
using it
o-o
to play
o-o
trivia
o-o
games.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here I'm walking
o-o
backwards.
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
this is like
o-o
moving forward
o-o
in time.
o-o
The future
o-o
is behind me
o-o
where I
o-o
cannot see.
o-o
So I look
o-o
where I've been.
o-o
That's the past.
o-o
The patterns
o-o
give me clues
o-o
about
o-o
that which is
o-o
yet to be.
o-o
So history
o-o
is like a
o-o
crystal ball.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I see!
o-o
History
o-o
is a preview
o-o
of the future.
o-o
Who knew?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Many people
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
think that
o-o
history
o-o
is mostly
o-o
recalling
o-o
facts about
o-o
the past.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In a history
o-o
trivia contest
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would beat me
o-o
like the loudest
o-o
drum in a
o-o
marchin' band.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would be
o-o
a great way
o-o
to learn
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wikipedia is wrong
o-o
lots of the time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
About topics
o-o
that affect
o-o
people's
o-o
finances,
o-o
sure.
o-o
But Wikipedia
o-o
is usually
o-o
right about
o-o
non hyphen-here recent
o-o
history.
o-o
Also about
o-o
non hyphen-here medical
o-o
biochemistry,
o-o
basic
o-o
mathematics,
o-o
and movie plots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My eyes are
o-o
cryin'
o-o
just thinkin'
o-o
about reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
so much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said that
o-o
reading glasses
o-o
with a blue tint
o-o
helps with books.
o-o
A good browser
o-o
can change
o-o
Wikipedia's
o-o
white background
o-o
to blue.
o-o
See how that looks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll give that
o-o
trick a try.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Rather than facts,
o-o
what's more useful
o-o
regarding
o-o
history
o-o
is causation.
o-o
Cause and effect.
o-o
And the ones
o-o
that involve
o-o
a surprise
o-o
are the insights
o-o
you should
o-o
prize.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can ya translate
o-o
that into a
o-o
for instance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's start with the
o-o
nineteen fifties
o-o
and nineteen sixties
o-o
and into the
o-o
nineteen seventies.
o-o
Why was the
o-o
U.S.
o-o
economy
o-o
so
o-o
prosperous?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That was before
o-o
my time so
o-o
I don't know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This has to do
o-o
with World War Two,
o-o
doesn't it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
That war happened
o-o
back in, ...
o-o
well it ended in
o-o
nineteen fourty five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Well,
o-o
the
o-o
boomer babies
o-o
were born
o-o
and raised.
o-o
That
o-o
increased
o-o
consumption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wasn't around,
o-o
so I don't know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Does this have
o-o
anything to do with
o-o
not getting bombed
o-o
here in the US?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Except at Pearl
o-o
Harbor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Factories
o-o
and power plants
o-o
throughout
o-o
the world
o-o
were bombed,
o-o
except in
o-o
the United States,
o-o
Canada,
o-o
and less hyphen-here accessible
o-o
parts of
o-o
Russia.
o-o
Why was that
o-o
noteworthy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Anyone who wanted
o-o
a factory job
o-o
could get one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
What else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Didn't factory jobs
o-o
pay well back then?
o-o
Well enough
o-o
to buy a house?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
and what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't feel
o-o
brainy,
o-o
'cause I don't
o-o
see where
o-o
you're going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What's that called
o-o
when there is only
o-o
one place that sells
o-o
what people
o-o
want to buy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
a monopoly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Oh yeah,
o-o
the entire world
o-o
had to buy
o-o
manufactured
o-o
goods
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
and Canada
o-o
and Russia.
o-o
Because other
o-o
factories
o-o
on the planet
o-o
had become
o-o
dinosaurs,
o-o
wiped out by
o-o
bombs instead
o-o
of an
o-o
asteroid.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And when there's
o-o
a monopoly
o-o
the seller
o-o
can sell
o-o
at high prices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And that big
o-o
flow of money
o-o
to factories
o-o
meant higher
o-o
wages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great thinking!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute!
o-o
Is that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity 
o-o
what voters
o-o
think of
o-o
when they hear
o-o
the slogan
o-o
about making
o-o
America
o-o
great again?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
so this is why
o-o
the orange hyphen-here makeup guy
o-o
in the red tie
o-o
got so many votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But he blames
o-o
immigrants
o-o
and blacks
o-o
and women
o-o
for the bad
o-o
economy
o-o
we have now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
As the son of
o-o
an immigrant
o-o
family,
o-o
from India,
o-o
I too think
o-o
that's ironic.
o-o
Even worse,
o-o
for voters,
o-o
it's foolish
o-o
to think
o-o
we can regain
o-o
that prior
o-o
prosperity
o-o
by building
o-o
factories.
o-o
Do you see why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The monopoly
o-o
ended.
o-o
Other nations
o-o
built new
o-o
factories.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does this mean
o-o
the belief
o-o
that anyone
o-o
can get rich by
o-o
working hard
o-o
has reached
o-o
its expiration
o-o
date?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
History
o-o
reveals
o-o
that prosperity
o-o
happens when a
o-o
city, nation,
o-o
or region
o-o
sells something
o-o
that people outside
o-o
the region
o-o
either need or
o-o
strongly desire.
o-o
And it's not
o-o
available from
o-o
anywhere else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are just
o-o
short blips
o-o
that pass
o-o
like fads,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Do you know what
o-o
the silk road was?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
Marco Polo
o-o
and lots of
o-o
caravans
o-o
traveled along
o-o
it to get silk
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
China was getting
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
things flowing
o-o
into their country
o-o
to pay for the silk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that made
o-o
China rich?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Better than that,
o-o
instead of
o-o
just selling
o-o
spools of silk,
o-o
they wove it into
o-o
begin-italics beautiful end-italics
o-o
fabric
o-o
that was worth
o-o
more than
o-o
its weight
o-o
in gold.
o-o
And they wisely
o-o
kept their special
o-o
silkworms within
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City to
o-o
protect their
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Forbidden
o-o
City's the
o-o
fortress where
o-o
the emperor
o-o
of China
o-o
lived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That monopoly
o-o
lasted for
o-o
centuries.
o-o
So they aren't
o-o
always blips
o-o
in time.
o-o
Also the
o-o
Arabic hyphen-here speaking
o-o
traders
o-o
along the
o-o
middle eastern
o-o
part of the
o-o
silk road
o-o
monopolized
o-o
access
o-o
to that silk,
o-o
and that trade
o-o
monopoly
o-o
also lasted
o-o
for centuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Portuguese
o-o
ships
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Brazil,
o-o
and then
o-o
Columbus
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Caribbean
o-o
Islands.
o-o
They were looking
o-o
for an
o-o
alternate route
o-o
to China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ok,
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are not always
o-o
short blips.
o-o
And I see
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are good for
o-o
sellers
o-o
but bad for
o-o
customers.
o-o
But how does that
o-o
affect today's
o-o
economy?
o-o
It seems like
o-o
rising to
o-o
the middle class
o-o
based on hard work
o-o
is something
o-o
from the past,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not that
o-o
simple.
o-o
Do you know
o-o
about inflation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah!
o-o
The cost of
o-o
rent 'n food
o-o
'n ice cream
o-o
are going up
o-o
and up fast
o-o
while salaries
o-o
suck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
my salary
o-o
stays stuck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
reasons why
o-o
the cost of living
o-o
is going up
o-o
faster than
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
which is the
o-o
official
o-o
measurement
o-o
of inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I remember
o-o
that number
o-o
is corrupt,
o-o
but I forgot
o-o
why it's corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Part of the why
o-o
is because
o-o
back when the price
o-o
of food items
o-o
were quickly
o-o
rising,
o-o
some food items
o-o
were replaced by
o-o
items whose cost
o-o
were declining.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's declining
o-o
in cost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The per hyphen-here pixel cost
o-o
of digital
o-o
cameras.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize
o-o
that word begin-italics per end-italics no-space .
o-o
It means division.
o-o
And the number
o-o
of pixels in
o-o
a camera
o-o
are going up,
o-o
so dividing by
o-o
that bigger number
o-o
makes the result
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah, the
o-o
government
o-o
is hiding the real
o-o

Why
o-o
are they
o-o
lying?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The consumer
o-o
price index
o-o
is linked to
o-o
such things as
o-o
retirement
o-o
pensions for
o-o
government
o-o
employees,
o-o
and social
o-o
security
o-o
benefits,
o-o
and the
o-o
interest
o-o
the government
o-o
pays for
o-o
borrowed
o-o
money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the government
o-o
basically
o-o
uses tricks
o-o
to pretend
o-o
inflation
o-o
is low,
o-o
so it pays out
o-o
less money,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics tricks end-italics
o-o
is a bit
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We can't
o-o
call it
o-o
what it is,
o-o
which is
o-o
lying,
o-o
and stealing,
o-o
and corruption.
o-o
Shall we
o-o
call it an
o-o
intentional
o-o
distortion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's not.
o-o
Already I'm
o-o
avoiding talking about
o-o
economic
o-o
terminology
o-o
such as begin-italics the tragedy
o-o
of the commons end-italics no-space .
o-o
Instead I'm
o-o
simplifying
o-o
by talking about
o-o
economic pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No wonder
o-o
school is so
o-o
distasteful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm glad we're
o-o
getting the
o-o
uncommon version,
o-o
not the tragic
o-o
version.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Getting back to
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
it excludes
o-o
rent and fuel
o-o
because they're
o-o
too volatile.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Volatile
o-o
means they
o-o
jump up and down
o-o
like a
o-o
candy hyphen-here filled kid
o-o
in a bouncy
o-o
house.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yet food and rent
o-o
are on a clear trend
o-o
upwards.
o-o
They rip off
o-o
a bigger
o-o
and bigger
o-o
part of my
o-o

o-o
Is anything else
o-o
being fudged?
end-lyric

Besides
o-o
ice cream

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
do you
o-o
remember from
o-o
econ one oh one
o-o
what determines
o-o
interest rates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The federal
o-o
reserve chooses
o-o
when to increase
o-o
and decrease the
o-o
interest rate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the rate
o-o
talked about
o-o
in the news,
o-o
but more important
o-o
is the rate
o-o
determined by
o-o
auctioning
o-o
treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I don't remember
o-o
learning about
o-o
those actions,
o-o
I mean,
o-o
auctions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not taught to
o-o
undergrads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll bet textbooks
o-o
don't include it
o-o
because schools
o-o
are funded by
o-o
the government.
o-o
So textbooks can't
o-o
reveal secrets
o-o
the government
o-o
wants to hide.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Some
o-o
U.S.
o-o
treasuries
o-o
are sold in
o-o
auctions.
o-o
In economically
o-o
optimistic
o-o
times those
o-o
treasuries
o-o
sell for
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
closer to the
o-o
amount the
o-o
government pays
o-o
when they reach their
o-o
redemption date.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but in
o-o
economically
o-o
pessimistic
o-o
times the buyers
o-o
pay much less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
then the gap
o-o
between
o-o
purchase price
o-o
and redemption
o-o
payment
o-o
increases.
o-o
So that
o-o
brings up rates
o-o
of interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Optimism?
o-o
Pessimism?
o-o
Feelings matter?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You buy more stuff
o-o
when you're
o-o
less afraid
o-o
of the future.
o-o
Like during
o-o
the cheery
o-o
holiday season.
o-o
So economists
o-o
have to measure
o-o
those feelings
o-o
to predict
o-o
the future.
o-o
We use
o-o
something called
o-o
consumer
o-o
confidence.
o-o
You've heard
o-o
of that,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm a consumer,
o-o
or I try to be,
o-o
but I have no
o-o
confidence.
o-o
In the future.
o-o
And at the moment
o-o
something makes
o-o
no sense.
o-o
Interest rates
o-o
are low.
o-o
That means there's
o-o
lots of buyers
o-o
for those
o-o
...
o-o
things?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
Yes, normally.
o-o
But China and
o-o
Russia stopped
o-o
buying them so
o-o
lately the
o-o
federal reserve
o-o
has been buying
o-o
lots of them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm even
o-o
more confused.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The government
o-o
buying its own
o-o
money,
o-o
that makes
o-o
no sense.
o-o
It would be like
o-o
a plush toy
o-o
dinosaur
o-o
business
o-o
buying its own
o-o
dinos to give
o-o
the appearance
o-o
of extra customers
o-o
and income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's partly
o-o
why the deficit
o-o
is so huge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, so the U.S.
o-o
government has
o-o
increased its debt
o-o
to compensate
o-o
for rough times
o-o
economically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a moment.
o-o
Our economy's
o-o
like a stack of
o-o
wood blocks in a
o-o
teetering tower
o-o
that's ready to
o-o
fall?
o-o
Except that
o-o
kind of falling
o-o
will kill
o-o
and maim
o-o
instead of
o-o
just shame?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
All nations
o-o
and all big
o-o
businesses
o-o
are in debt.
o-o
So are farmers.
o-o
They all have to
o-o
borrow first
o-o
before they can
o-o
grow crops or
o-o
manufacture
o-o
or whatever to
o-o
get income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So being in debt
o-o
isn't a big deal,
o-o
but a growing
o-o
debt, that's
o-o
disastrous,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Relatively
o-o
speaking, yes.
o-o
But as long as
o-o
the government
o-o
is keeping its
o-o
citizens happy,
o-o
and happier than
o-o
in other nations,
o-o
problems can be
o-o
hidden behind
o-o
curtains of
o-o
distraction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The number of
o-o
people trying
o-o
to immigrate
o-o
into the U.S.
o-o
is still high.
o-o
So that
o-o
suggests
o-o
success.
o-o
Yet things
o-o
are a mess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what should be
o-o
going on instead?
o-o
Besides
o-o
traveling
o-o
in flying
o-o
cars.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
An important way
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity
o-o
is to increase
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How come
o-o
prosperity
o-o
increases
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your time machine
o-o
is running
o-o
backwards.
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
increases
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Consider the
o-o
Roman empire.
o-o
They wrote laws
o-o
to control
o-o
business and
o-o
commerce.
o-o
And they used
o-o
soldiers and
o-o
inspectors
o-o
and courts
o-o
to enforce
o-o
those laws.
o-o
An especially
o-o
important
o-o
innovation
o-o
was to set
o-o
standards for
o-o
weights and sizes.
o-o
And they built roads
o-o
and patroled them
o-o
with soldiers.
o-o
They built aqueducts
o-o
to channel water
o-o
to cities.
o-o
All of that
o-o
greatly increased
o-o
the efficiency
o-o
of their economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
o-o
Economic
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Economic
o-o
efficiency
o-o
means something
o-o
different.
o-o
Here I'm talking
o-o
about efficiency
o-o
as a general
o-o
concept,
o-o
where profits
o-o
go up
o-o
when costs
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
costs went down
o-o
when those
o-o
Romans wasted
o-o
less time
o-o
fetching water,
o-o
they got sick less
o-o
because they had
o-o
water to wash
o-o
their hands,
o-o
and better roads
o-o
gave them a
o-o
better warranty
o-o
on their
o-o
ox hyphen-here cart wheels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And there was
o-o
less cheating.
o-o
Those inspectors,
o-o
backed up by
o-o
soldiers,
o-o
made sure that
o-o
merchants
o-o
didn't use
o-o
heavier weights
o-o
to measure
o-o
what they bought,
o-o
and lighter weights
o-o
to measure
o-o
the gold and gems
o-o
they paid.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And soldiers
o-o
patrolling
o-o
the better roads
o-o
meant there
o-o
was less
o-o
highway
o-o
robbery
o-o
by bad
o-o
Samaritans.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Less time wasted.
o-o
Less stealing.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
less corruption!
o-o
Like not tying
o-o
left and right
o-o
shoelaces together.
o-o
That makes progress
o-o
without
o-o
unnecessary
o-o
tripping.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is making
o-o
sense to me.
o-o
When there's
o-o
less corruption
o-o
there's less waste.
o-o
That means more time
o-o
goes into
o-o
building things
o-o
worthwhile,
o-o
and
o-o
valuable,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
there will be
o-o
lots more
o-o
efficiency
o-o
and
o-o
productivity.
o-o
That will increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That will be
o-o
widespread
o-o
prosperity,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not just for 
o-o
the filthy rich,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
that fits the
o-o
pattern of
o-o
history.
o-o
Another
o-o
important
o-o
ingredient
o-o
is to have less
o-o
fighting.
o-o
Not only less
o-o
physical
o-o
fighting,
o-o
but fewer
o-o
business disputes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
fighting
o-o
also wastes
o-o
time, money,
o-o
resources, ...
o-o
... and lives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since efficiency
o-o
is so important,
o-o
economists
o-o
measure it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
They think they do.
o-o
They have
o-o
something
o-o
called the
o-o
productivity
o-o
index.
o-o
But it's flawed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
You do remember
o-o
some economics.
o-o
The productivity
o-o
index
o-o
is supposed to
o-o
measure
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which is similar
o-o
to efficiency.
o-o
Yet that index
o-o
increases
o-o
when a house
o-o
burns down
o-o
and then
o-o
inexpensively
o-o
gets rebuilt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course it
o-o
would be even
o-o
more efficient
o-o
if the house
o-o
never burned down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Measuring
o-o
non hyphen-here destruction,
o-o
alas that's not
o-o
a sexy topic
o-o
that attracts
o-o
economists'
o-o
attention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And that index
o-o
fails to
o-o
account for
o-o
the benefits
o-o
of volunteers
o-o
working in
o-o
public
o-o
libraries,
o-o
and the
o-o
benefits
of better
o-o
public
o-o
education.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if efficiency
o-o
is what made the
o-o
Roman empire
o-o
great,
o-o
why did it
o-o
decline?
o-o
In just a
o-o
sentence or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If all the books
o-o
on this subject
o-o
fell on you,
o-o
you'd get buried
o-o
in an avalanche
o-o
ten feet high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'll try to
o-o
oversimplify.
o-o
After the years of
o-o
good governance
o-o
and
o-o
prosperity,
o-o
corruption grew.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Plus
o-o
a huge source
o-o
of wealth
o-o
for ancient Rome
o-o
was through
o-o
conquest.
o-o
That means stealing.
o-o
But they ran out
o-o
of wealthy places
o-o
to conquer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, the
o-o
Roman army
o-o
invaded
o-o
surrounding
o-o
territories.
o-o
Besides
o-o
stealing
o-o
gold and jewels,
o-o
and crowns and
o-o
tiaras,
o-o
and artwork,
o-o
and sending it
o-o
back to Rome,
o-o
they installed
o-o
tax collectors.
end-lyric


ambee sings-desha amenn
Lots of those
o-o
taxes were paid
o-o
with grains and
o-o
other food
o-o
that fed
o-o
the soldiers
o-o
and the wealthy
o-o
in Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But that ends
o-o
when there's
o-o
no more regions
o-o
to conquer
o-o
and plunder,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Basically
o-o
that's the kids' book
o-o
version of the
o-o
Roman empire.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's the economic
o-o
opposite
o-o
of corruption?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This is going
o-o
to take awhile.
o-o
What I'm wearing
o-o
might go
o-o
out of style.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
multiple
o-o
opposites
o-o
because there are
o-o
multiple
o-o
kinds of
o-o
corruption.
o-o
One opposite is
o-o
the free market.
o-o
You know what that is,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In an ideal free market,
o-o
there are no barriers.
o-o
People can choose
o-o
what to buy,
o-o
what to sell,
o-o
how much to charge,
o-o
and whatever else,
o-o
without fighting.
o-o
That's a fluid,
o-o
flexible,
o-o
and efficient,
o-o
economy.
o-o
But corruption?
o-o
That puts up barriers
o-o
that are chosen
o-o
to channel money
o-o
into specific pockets.
o-o
Those corrupt
o-o
barriers
o-o
reduce
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I've
o-o
got it.
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
and stealing from
o-o
foreigners is
o-o
what brings money
o-o
into a region.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which causes
o-o
economic
o-o
decline.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a bit
o-o
fuzzy but ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My butt's fuzzy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If you say so.
o-o
I can see
o-o
it's firm.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Perhaps I should
o-o
clarify.
o-o
A similar kind of
o-o
rise and fall
o-o
pattern happened
o-o
later with the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
o-o
It started with
o-o
efficient banking.
o-o
Plus improved ships
o-o
and navigation
o-o
using technology
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The compass, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the ship's
o-o
rudder.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Of course
o-o
gunpowder.
o-o
And the digit zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You're astute!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No my ass
o-o
didn't toot!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Astute.
o-o
It means your brain
o-o
just did the
o-o
equivalent of
o-o
a gymnastics
o-o
triple twist
o-o
vault
o-o
with a perfect
o-o
landing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh thanks!
o-o
So what kind of
o-o
corruption
o-o
ended the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Europe's
o-o
economy
o-o
was dominated
o-o
by guilds,
o-o
secret
o-o
societies,
o-o
fraternal
o-o
organizations,
o-o
and nepotism.
o-o
Plus churches
o-o
heavily taxed
o-o
their members,
o-o
with lots of that
o-o
going to the
o-o
Vatican
o-o
in Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Catholic
o-o
churches
o-o
are so ornate,
o-o
even on the
o-o
ceilings.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
I've heard about
o-o
the ceiling
o-o
in the Sistine
o-o
Chapel
o-o
where a second
o-o
artist had to
o-o
cover the
o-o
private parts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Those taxes,
o-o
especially indulgences,
o-o
were so corrupt
o-o
that Martin Luther
o-o
and others
o-o
created the
o-o
Protestant
o-o
religions,
o-o
and England
o-o
created
o-o
its own church
o-o
to shift that
o-o
corruption
o-o
to stay in the
o-o
same country.
o-o
And
o-o
immigrants
o-o
in America
o-o
stopped
o-o
tolerating
o-o
corrupt
o-o
churches.
o-o
So it was
o-o
a gradual
o-o
shift.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
I'm seeing
o-o
the pattern.
o-o
Less corruption
o-o
less waste,
o-o
gradually.
o-o
But what's
o-o
nepo...
o-o
whatever.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nepotism
o-o
is hiring
o-o
family
o-o
members.
o-o
And friends.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't that a
o-o
no hyphen-here brainer?
o-o
Hiring based on
o-o
skills and
o-o
a good
o-o
word-resume no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Hiring
o-o
relatives
o-o
and friends
o-o
channels wealth
o-o
selfishly
o-o
for short hyphen-here term gains.

I'm glad
o-o
we only have
o-o
a bit of that
o-o
kind of
o-o
corruption.
o-o
Along with
o-o
less beer drinking
o-o
in frat houses.
o-o
But do fewer
o-o
rich people
o-o
really hold back
o-o
on indulgences
o-o
for food
o-o
and wine
o-o
and,
o-o
well ...
o-o
ice cream?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not that kind of
o-o
fraternal
o-o
organization.
o-o
And not those kinds
o-o
of indulgences.
o-o
I'll explain those
o-o
later.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In hindsight
o-o
all of those
o-o
outdated
o-o
traditions
o-o
can be seen as
o-o
corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And inefficient,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
In contrast,
o-o
America
o-o
gave
o-o
democracy
o-o
a place to grow,
o-o
far away from
o-o
big armies
o-o
and navies.
o-o
The resulting
o-o
cooperation
o-o
among U.S. states
o-o
led to immense
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
That's why
o-o
a few
o-o
decades ago
o-o
Europeans
o-o
formed the
o-o
European
o-o
Union.
o-o
They finally
o-o
abandoned
o-o
fighting between
o-o
Catholics and
o-o
Protestants,
o-o
except in
o-o
northern Ireland.
o-o
And they
o-o
abandoned
o-o
fighting over
o-o
language
o-o
differences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And they stopped
o-o
having food fights
o-o
about table
o-o
etiquette.
o-o
And European
o-o
governments
o-o
now allow women
o-o
some seats in
o-o
parliament
o-o
after seeing
o-o
American Rosie
o-o
the Riveters
o-o
bail them out
o-o
of their
o-o
foolish World War
o-o
Two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Instead they are
o-o
copying
o-o
the clear
o-o
success of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
that works so well
o-o
in the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said warfare
o-o
undermines the
o-o
economy.
o-o
Yet political hawks,
o-o
who are mostly
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
promote warfare
o-o
as a way to
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
And competition
o-o
between
o-o
nations,
o-o
and between
o-o
businesses,
o-o
is the basis
o-o
of prosperity
o-o
in a free market,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm lost.
o-o
I feel like I'm
o-o
in a maze and
o-o
someone turned off
o-o
the lights.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Competition
o-o
between
o-o
businesses
o-o
provides
o-o
motivation
o-o
to work hard.
o-o
But what gets
o-o
overlooked is
o-o
the teamwork
o-o
among
o-o
employees.
o-o
That cooperation
o-o
yields
o-o
efficiency.
o-o
The same kind of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
happens among
o-o
citizens
o-o
within the same
o-o
nation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hmm.
o-o
So teamwork
o-o
is more than
o-o
touchy hyphen-here feely
o-o
games?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, employees
o-o
getting along,
o-o
who wouldn't
o-o
normally get along.
o-o
Like employees
o-o
ignoring
o-o
racial differences,
o-o
religious
o-o
differences,
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, and Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
ignoring their
o-o
differences
o-o
while at work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see!
o-o
When these
o-o
conflicts
o-o
are ignored,
o-o
that's cooperation.
o-o
And that increases
o-o
efficiency
o-o
begin-italics within end-italics
o-o
the business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So cooperation
o-o
within a business
o-o
makes the business
o-o
strong,
o-o
so it can better
o-o
compete against
o-o
other
o-o
businesses?
o-o
The lights are
o-o
coming back on.
o-o
I think I see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So fighting
o-o
between groups
o-o
of people
o-o
inspires,
o-o
motivates,
o-o
cooperation
o-o
within each
o-o
group?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not a bad
o-o
simplification.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And a lack
o-o
of cooperation
o-o
is why
o-o
climate change
o-o
is turning
o-o
our planet
o-o
into toast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Some big kinds of
o-o
cooperation,
o-o
like
o-o
public schools,
o-o
food for the poor,
o-o
hospitals, and
o-o
orphanages
o-o
for little
o-o
orphan
o-o
Annies,
o-o
were created
o-o
by churches,
o-o
and promoted by
o-o
religions.
