Religion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Ancient priests
o-o
in Egypt earned
o-o
their grain and beer
o-o
by predicting
o-o
eclipses
o-o
so their boss,
o-o
the pharaoh,
o-o
could pretend
o-o
to be powerful.
o-o
And they
o-o
predicted
o-o
when the Nile
o-o
River would
o-o
flood and recede.
o-o
Plus each year
o-o
priests used
o-o
mathematics
o-o
and surveying
o-o
to lay out
o-o
that year's
o-o
farming
o-o
boundaries.
o-o
All of that was
o-o
like magic
o-o
to people who
o-o
didn't understand
o-o
astronomy,
o-o
weather,
o-o
geometry,
o-o
and fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Galileo
o-o
was a threat to the
o-o
Catholic Church.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Because
o-o
he made
o-o
ditsy
o-o
people
o-o
dizzy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He showed that
o-o
science
o-o
was better than
o-o
priests
o-o
at those
o-o
brainy
o-o
skills.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed,
o-o
priests lost
o-o
lots of
o-o
credibility,
o-o
plus their lives,
o-o
during the
o-o
European
o-o
black death
o-o
by praying
o-o
at the bedside
o-o
of the dying.
o-o
And because
o-o
they sold
o-o
holy water
o-o
that failed
o-o
to cure the sick.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And their
o-o
version of
o-o
a trip to
o-o
Disneyland
o-o
was a long
o-o
pilgrimage
o-o
to kneel before
o-o
the pelvic
o-o
bone of
o-o
martyred
o-o
Saint Marty
o-o
Sandinhart.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Which spread
o-o
diseases
o-o
even faster.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those priests
o-o
would have flunked
o-o
out of
o-o
medical
o-o
school.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of what
o-o
was once done by
o-o
religion
o-o
has split into
o-o
science,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
public
o-o
education,
o-o
government,
o-o
the music
o-o
industry,
o-o
and the
o-o
Hallmark
o-o
TV channel.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So I'm
o-o
seeing that
o-o
if we,
o-o
the majority
o-o
of voters,
o-o
could elect
o-o
leaders who care,
o-o
those leaders
o-o
would reduce
o-o
corruption.
o-o
And that will
o-o
increase
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which will
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
And there
o-o
will be more
o-o
cooperation.
o-o
What else
o-o
would change?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When an economy
o-o
is not blocked
o-o
by wealthy people
o-o
who cling to
o-o
corruption,
o-o
there are many
o-o
opportunities
o-o
for new kinds of
o-o
business
o-o
based on
o-o
innovation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Computers
o-o
and the
o-o
internet
o-o
are big
o-o
innovations.
o-o
But most people
o-o
seem to use them
o-o
to yell
o-o
at strangers,
o-o
gawk at
o-o
celebrities,
o-o
and laugh at
o-o
squirrels
o-o
defeating,
o-o
or getting
o-o
defeated by,
o-o
bird hyphen-here feeder
o-o
barriers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
I think
o-o
I see.
o-o
Amazon
o-o
created
o-o
lots of software,
o-o
innovative
o-o
software,
o-o
that replaces the
o-o
inefficiency
o-o
of people
o-o
selling stuff
o-o
in retail
o-o
stores.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Retail stores
o-o
have megatons of
o-o
inefficiency.
o-o
In my retail job
o-o
I had to
o-o
count out change
o-o
when someone
o-o
handed me
o-o
cash.
o-o
We had to watch
o-o
suspicious
o-o
customers
o-o
who might steal.
o-o
And countless
o-o
customers
o-o
interrupted
o-o
me because
o-o
they were too
o-o
lazy to read
o-o
the big sign
o-o
with a big arrow
o-o
that said
o-o
begin-italics
restrooms
end-italics
no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Amazon
o-o
eliminates
o-o
cash,
o-o
theft, and
o-o
restrooms.
o-o
That increases
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
and reduces
o-o
waste.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it increases
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for Jeff
o-o
Bezos.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's something else
o-o
that shouldn't be
o-o
wasted.
o-o
It's difficult
o-o
to measure,
o-o
so it's easily
o-o
overlooked.
o-o
Consider what
o-o
happened in Britain
o-o
during World War One.
o-o
It was popular for
o-o
university hyphen-here educated men
o-o
to volunteer to fight
o-o
in that war.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
They got slaughtered
o-o
in the trenches.
o-o
Lots of knowledge
o-o
and lots of skills
o-o
died with them.
o-o
What a waste.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And that reduced
o-o
the people
o-o
who could
o-o
educate
o-o
the next
o-o
generation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, so that's why
o-o
men in college
o-o
get excluded
o-o
when there's a
o-o
military
o-o
draft.
o-o
I see.
o-o
Knowledge and skills
o-o
are also resources
o-o
that can get
o-o
used wisely,
o-o
or wasted.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Or lost.
o-o
During the
o-o
European
o-o
black death,
o-o
lots of blacksmiths
o-o
and ship builders
o-o
and court jesters
o-o
died.
o-o
With them died
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
knowledge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Jesters
o-o
knew how to
o-o
juggle
o-o
pig bladders
o-o
and chew berries
o-o
at the same time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back before
o-o
Netflix and
o-o
the iPod
o-o
and radio,
o-o
even before
o-o
record players,
o-o
music and jokes
o-o
and dances
o-o
could only be
o-o
heard or seen in
o-o
the presence of
o-o
musicians,
o-o
storytellers,
o-o
dancers, and
o-o
jesters.
o-o
If they died
o-o
without passing
o-o
along what
o-o
they knew,
o-o
their
o-o
melodious songs,
o-o
spellbinding
o-o
stories,
o-o
tantalizing
o-o
dances,
o-o
and hilarious
o-o
jokes
o-o
got lost.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, death.
o-o
It takes so much away.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In those times
o-o
horseshoes,
o-o
swords, and
o-o
sailing ships
o-o
were high
o-o
technology.
o-o
That's why blacksmiths
o-o
and ship builders
o-o
were so
o-o
valuable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is this
o-o
related
o-o
to why humans
o-o
haven't
o-o
recently
o-o
walked on the moon?
o-o
Losing knowledge?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes.
o-o
The people
o-o
who knew how to
o-o
put them there
o-o
are dead,
o-o
or retired.
o-o
And some written
o-o
knowledge on
o-o
computer
o-o
hard drives
o-o
was erased.
o-o
On the bright side,
o-o
the opposite
o-o
of losing
o-o
knowledge
o-o
is gaining
o-o
knowledge.
o-o
That's what gave
o-o
strength to the
o-o
Islamic
o-o
Golden Age.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's when Bagdad
o-o
was the center
o-o
of an empire
o-o
of people who
o-o
spoke Arabic
o-o
and followed
o-o
the religion
o-o
of Islam.
o-o
A wise ruler,
o-o
whose name I don't
o-o
remember ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
...
o-o
Harun al hyphen-here Rashid,
o-o
at the end of
o-o
the seven hundreds ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
...
o-o
collected books
o-o
and gathered
o-o
wise scholars
o-o
from around the world,
o-o
and paid smart people
o-o
to develop things
o-o
like algebra,
o-o
geometry,
o-o
and ...,
o-o
I forget what else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Medicine,
o-o
three D drawings,
o-o
robotic mechanisms,
o-o
papermaking,
o-o
and much more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that when
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
made its way
o-o
closer to Europe?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes, and why
o-o
Europeans
o-o
and we refer
o-o
to the digits
o-o
zero through nine
o-o
as Arabic
o-o
numerals.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus plus.
o-o
And that empire
o-o
became weak
o-o
as a result
o-o
of what?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Corruption
o-o
I'll bet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, including
o-o
a dismissal
o-o
of science.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
People who
o-o
dismiss science
o-o
are doubly stupid.
o-o
And I'll bet
o-o
some of them
o-o
are capitalists
o-o
who fail to see
o-o
that the loss of
o-o
science leads the
o-o
economy
o-o
into a death
o-o
spiral.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
About
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
how come it
o-o
so often wins
o-o
against
o-o
knowledge?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Dictators
o-o
and wannabe
o-o
dictators
o-o
outlaw or
o-o
monopolize
o-o
knowledge.
o-o
When Mao Zedong
o-o
led China
o-o
he destroyed books
o-o
and banished
o-o
intellectuals
o-o
to manual hyphen-here labor
o-o
jobs.
o-o
That undermined
o-o
the economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Chinese spies
o-o
steal secrets
o-o
of technology
o-o
from us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since
o-o
Europeans
o-o
got lots of
o-o
inventions
o-o
from China,
o-o
did earlier
o-o
Chinese rulers
o-o
do better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Chinese emperors
o-o
feared losing
o-o
what they called
o-o
the mandate
o-o
of heaven.
o-o
What we call
o-o
the right to rule.
o-o
Especially
o-o
they feared
o-o
natural
o-o
disasters.
o-o
That's because
o-o
too many deaths
o-o
caused by flood,
o-o
or earthquakes,
o-o
or crop failure,
o-o
would lead to
o-o
rebellion and
o-o
revolution.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
Congress lost
o-o
the mandate
o-o
of heaven
o-o
long ago.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To prevent
o-o
catastrophes
o-o
Chinese leaders
o-o
hired and
o-o
promoted
o-o
based on
o-o
competence
o-o
instead of
o-o
nepotism
o-o
and favoritism.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So innovation
o-o
is good.
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
we need more
o-o
innovative
o-o
politicians
o-o
like Bernie
o-o
Sanders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
He promotes
o-o
socialism,
o-o
but that's not
o-o
innovation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't
o-o
socialism
o-o
better than
o-o
capitalism?
o-o
Because it's
o-o
based on
o-o
cooperation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
No because
o-o
free markets
o-o
more quickly
o-o
respond to
o-o
fast changes in
o-o
supply and
o-o
demand.
o-o
Remember that
o-o
socialism
o-o
attempts to
o-o
control
o-o
markets
o-o
from the top down
o-o
using constraints,
o-o
such as laws,
o-o
quotas,
o-o
penalties,
o-o
fixed prices,
o-o
and such.
o-o
Those constraints
o-o
can't change as fast
o-o
as what happens
o-o
at the bottom
o-o
of the economy.
o-o
Also
o-o
remember that
o-o
cooperation
o-o
is the
o-o
foundation of
o-o
capitalism,
o-o
where the buyer
o-o
and seller
o-o
cooperate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wanna see
o-o
if I'm
o-o
understanding.
o-o
...
o-o
A free and
o-o
efficient
o-o
market's like
o-o
letting water
o-o
find its own way
o-o
to the ocean?
o-o
Instead of
o-o
trying to
o-o
redirect
o-o
rivers.
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a useful
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
Where socialism
o-o
is like trying
o-o
to redirect
o-o
rivers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ok,
o-o
capitalism
o-o
is sometimes bad,
o-o
but it doesn't
o-o
have to be bad.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And now,
o-o
finally,
o-o
you're ready to
o-o
understand
o-o
something
o-o
important
o-o
that doesn't have
o-o
a name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Bring it on!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's a very
o-o
effective
o-o
way for a
o-o
government
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
The first half
o-o
is to begin-italics decrease
o-o
taxes end-italics on
o-o
begin-italics business end-italics
o-o
activities
o-o
that are efficient
o-o
and bring a net flow
o-o
of money into
o-o
the region.
o-o
The second half
o-o
is to begin-italics increase
o-o
taxes end-italics on
o-o
begin-italics business end-italics
o-o
activities
o-o
that are
o-o
inefficient,
o-o
wasteful, or
o-o
plunder
o-o
the locals
o-o
in the style of
o-o
New Jersey
o-o
lawyers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So,
o-o
besides lawyers,
o-o
which
o-o
business
o-o
activities
o-o
are which?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's consider
o-o
some different
o-o
kinds of businesses.
o-o
How about farming?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That brings money in.
o-o
If the crops are sold
o-o
outside the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Which is part of
o-o
why farmers get
o-o
lots of special
o-o
government
o-o
subsidies.
o-o
How about manufacturing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That brings money in,
o-o
when the products 
o-o
are sold outside
o-o
the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought that
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses
o-o
were bad.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when the
o-o
industrial
o-o
revolution
o-o
began,
o-o
that was common.
o-o
Owners used
o-o
greedy shortcuts.
o-o
And still
o-o
there are some
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses
o-o
that treat laws
o-o
as if they're
o-o
optional
o-o
suggested
o-o
guidelines.
o-o
But today's
o-o
transgressions
o-o
are mild compared
o-o
to earlier times.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
A
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
business
o-o
doesn't need to be
o-o
bad.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If there were
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
for good
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses,
o-o
that would reward
o-o
them for
o-o
efficiently
o-o
hiring skilled
o-o
workers who
o-o
transform raw
o-o
materials
o-o
into valuable
o-o
products worth
o-o
lots of money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So software
o-o
businesses
o-o
would get lower
o-o
taxes too?
o-o
They bring lots of money
o-o
into the United States
o-o
from other nations,
o-o
and they just consume
o-o
electricity.
o-o
And they hire highly
o-o
skilled software
o-o
developers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great example.
o-o
How about mining
o-o
companies?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They bring lots of
o-o
money into the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But the U.S.
o-o
loses lots of
o-o
natural
o-o
resources
o-o
that future
o-o
generations
o-o
will come to miss,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Like Japan,
o-o
where they cut down
o-o
their forests for
o-o
firewood.
o-o
Now they buy
o-o
lots of timber
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
Or did back when
o-o
massive logging
o-o
was done in the
o-o
Pacific
o-o
Northwest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So mining and
o-o
timber businesses
o-o
deserve to pay
o-o
higher taxes,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics deserve end-italics
o-o
is judgemental,
o-o
so that's a matter
o-o
of opinion.
o-o
There might be times
o-o
when name-desha thinks
o-o
you deserve to be
o-o
spanked,
o-o
but that would be
o-o
a judgement,
o-o
not a fact.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In this case
o-o
it's a fact.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
But, yes, if
o-o
mining and timber
o-o
industries export
o-o
lots of materials
o-o
now, then future
o-o
generations
o-o
will not have those
o-o
resources to
o-o
use, sell,
o-o
or waste.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Short hyphen-here sighted capitalists.
o-o
Speaking of that,
o-o
what's capitalism?
o-o
It's confusing to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's because
o-o
the word really
o-o
has different
o-o
meanings
o-o
in different
o-o
situations.
o-o
Of course textbooks
o-o
carefully
o-o
define it,
o-o
but those
o-o
definitions
o-o
use words that
o-o
don't fully capture
o-o
exactly
o-o
what it means
o-o
every time
o-o
it's used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which explains why
o-o
so much of what I
o-o
learned in school
o-o
now seems like snow
o-o
on a sunny
o-o
hillside.
o-o
It's long gone.
o-o
But this,
o-o
what you're
o-o
teaching us,
o-o
reveals
o-o
so many
o-o
secrets
o-o
that lie beneath
o-o
puzzling
o-o
mysteries,
o-o
of why things are
o-o
the way they are.
o-o
So I think
o-o
I'll remember
o-o
most of it
o-o
for a long time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's a joy to
o-o
really get to teach
o-o
what's important!
o-o
Now, back to what
o-o
doesn't have an
o-o
official name.
o-o
How about artists,
o-o
writers, composers,
o-o
and other people
o-o
who create things
o-o

the cost of electricity

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Clearly they deserve,
o-o
er, should get,
o-o
lower taxes on their
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's this called?
o-o
This thing of
o-o
imposing
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
on businesses
o-o
that efficiently
o-o
create things of value.
o-o
And imposing
o-o
higher taxes
o-o
on businesses
o-o
that waste resources.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Or don't attract
o-o
as much money
o-o
into the

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The only name
o-o
I've heard is
o-o
begin-italics tax the makers
o-o
less than the
o-o
takers. end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I like that.
o-o
People like me
o-o
who wanna make things
o-o
would earn higher
o-o
wages because
o-o
of those lower
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And corporations
o-o
would pay much
o-o
higher taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some corporations
o-o
would pay higher
o-o
taxes.
o-o
Other corporations
o-o
create lots of
o-o
valuable products
o-o
and services,
o-o
and they would pay
o-o
lower taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which corporations
o-o
create value?
o-o
I thought that big
o-o
corporations
o-o
are predatory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Admittedly
o-o
big corporations
o-o
do tend to be
o-o
greedy.
o-o
Yet when a biz
o-o
is young
o-o
and small
o-o
and sparsely
o-o
funded,
o-o
it can't grow
o-o
if it doesn't
o-o
offer something
o-o
that benefits
o-o
lots of people.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I have my doubts
o-o
about that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are there
o-o
examples?
o-o
Something from
o-o
history?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when Google
o-o
started out,
o-o
it gave better
o-o
search results,
o-o
and fewer ads,
o-o
especially
o-o
on the first
o-o
results page.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now Google
o-o
hides its ads
o-o
on the websites
o-o
it sends people to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Amazon
o-o
started as
o-o
a bookstore
o-o
that gave
o-o
beginning
o-o
book authors
o-o
a way to
o-o
bypass the
o-o
monopolistic
o-o
New York City
o-o
book publishers
o-o
who were
o-o
inefficiently
o-o
renting
o-o
New York City
o-o
office space.
o-o
Bank of
o-o
America,
o-o
when it was
o-o
started in San
o-o
Fransisco,
o-o
it catered to
o-o
the special needs
o-o
of wealthy
o-o
Chinese
o-o
Americans
o-o
in Chinatown,
o-o
back when
o-o
other banks
o-o
shunned Asian
o-o
Americans as
o-o
customers.
o-o
What's important
o-o
to realize
o-o
is there are lots
o-o
of begin-italics small end-italics
o-o
corporations
o-o
you've never
o-o
heard of
o-o
that benefit
o-o
lots of people
o-o
in lots of
o-o
wonderful
o-o
ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like with
o-o
rich people?
o-o
Some are good,
o-o
and some are bad?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
o-o
And I'm glad
o-o
you see that
o-o
simply taxing
o-o
wealthy individuals
o-o
isn't the key.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I learned
o-o
they can hide
o-o

o-o
So they can evade

taxation.
o-o
'N exploit tax

o-o
in their

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it's harder
o-o
to figure out
o-o
which rich folks
o-o
deserve to be
o-o
wealthy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
None of them!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Can you not think
o-o
of any wealthy

people who deserve
o-o
to earn lots of
o-o
money for their work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My boss,
o-o
and other
o-o
owners of small
o-o
construction
o-o
businesses
o-o
like the one
o-o
I work in.
o-o
And maybe
o-o
Elon Musk
o-o
because he's

rocketizing cars

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But he's a jerk.
o-o
And probably
o-o
his real reason
o-o
for going to Mars
o-o
is to evade
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
So was Bill Gates
o-o
in his early years.
o-o
Being a jerk,
o-o
I mean.
o-o
But here we're
o-o
just talking
o-o
about whether
o-o
they've done things
o-o
that strengthen the
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
Oprah Winfrey
o-o

her wealth.
o-o
And Stephen

he makes me

the crazy

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They're all
o-o
in the political

up, along with

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's hard to judge
o-o
which individuals
o-o
are in what
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up versus down.
o-o
It's easier to do
o-o
with businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With individuals
o-o
we just need to look
o-o
at how much they give
o-o
to politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Following the
o-o
flow of money
o-o
in politics
o-o
is like slicing
o-o
an onion.
o-o
There are lots
o-o
of layers
o-o
to cut through,
o-o
and it becomes
o-o
hard to see
o-o
because
o-o
tears come to
o-o
your eyes.
o-o
It's easier to
o-o
separate the
o-o
takers from the makers
o-o
in businesses.
o-o
We look at
o-o
what the biz
o-o
does.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What if the biz
o-o
does both?
o-o
Making and
o-o
taking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We can prorate it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Get professionals
o-o
to rate the
o-o
business?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Prorating.
o-o
It's another
o-o
kind of
o-o
division.
o-o
The math kind.
o-o
It involves
o-o
percentages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, OK.
o-o
But my brain's
o-o
startin' to drain
o-o
'cause this seems like
o-o
sorting peaches
o-o
from apricots.
o-o
Is there some
o-o
pattern?
o-o
I mean
o-o
for sorting
o-o
takers from
o-o
makers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In general the
o-o
spectrum from
o-o
makers to takers
o-o
would be something
o-o
like this.
o-o
It starts with
o-o
farming and ranching.
o-o
Then to manufacturing,
o-o
cooking, brewing,
o-o
entertaining,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
inventing,
o-o
software developing,
o-o
oil refining,
o-o
research if it isn't
o-o
market research,
o-o
and other such
o-o
making activities.
o-o
Then to
o-o
teaching and training.
o-o
Then to healthcare,
o-o
grocery sales,
o-o
meat packing,
o-o
canning,
o-o
and maintenance.
o-o
Then to shipping,
o-o
retail stores,
o-o
hospitality,
o-o
and more.
o-o
Then to advertising
o-o
and marketing.
o-o
Then finally to
o-o
banking, insurance,
o-o
legal services,
o-o
real estate developers,
o-o
logging, mining,
o-o
casinos,
o-o
alcohol
o-o
businesses,
o-o
and the
o-o
tobacco
o-o
industry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
o-o
Especially because
o-o
sleazy
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers
o-o
would be at the bottom
o-o
paying the highest
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
Now it's finally
o-o
so much clearer
o-o
who I should fight!
o-o
And how I can fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that better
o-o
voting methods
o-o
would allow us
o-o
voters to elect
o-o
politicians
o-o
who'd pass laws
o-o
that change business
o-o
taxes?
o-o
In ways that
o-o
would lead to
o-o
a stronger
o-o
economy?
o-o
So there's
o-o
a big flow of
o-o
money into the
o-o
United States?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And higher taxes
o-o
for businesses
o-o
that mostly earn
o-o
their money from
o-o
local customers?
o-o
Like law firms,
o-o
Wall Street banks,
o-o
insurance
o-o
companies,
and
real-estate
o-o
developers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm not saying
o-o
what should be done,
o-o
or will be done.
o-o
I'm saying that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
would increase
o-o
if those changes
o-o
were made.
o-o
It would make
o-o
the cherry pie
o-o
so much
o-o
bigger!
o-o
Then everyone
o-o
can get
o-o
a bigger
o-o
slice.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N it would only
o-o
decrease
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for a few people
o-o
who earn their money
o-o
by owning
o-o
taker businesses?
o-o
That sounds great!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm ready for this fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it will
o-o
motivate
o-o
citizens
o-o
in Russia,
o-o
China,
o-o
and North
o-o
Korea
o-o
to overthrow
o-o
their
o-o
corrupt
o-o
dictatorships.
o-o
That's why
o-o
dictators
o-o
block news
o-o
that reveals
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
in democracies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And kill authors
o-o
of books that
o-o
criticize
o-o
people in power.
o-o
Nowadays
o-o
in the U.S.
o-o
dictators,
o-o
and wannabe
o-o
dictators,
o-o
indirectly hire
o-o
social media
o-o
influencers
o-o
to spread
o-o
fake news,
o-o
conspiracy
o-o
theories,
o-o
and
o-o
memes
o-o
that support
o-o
politicians
o-o
who speak kindly
o-o
about those
o-o
dictators.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey! I see a pattern.
o-o
The owners of
o-o
taker businesses
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
o-o
'N currently
o-o
their businesses
o-o
get so many tax breaks
o-o
they pay low
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
'N the owners
o-o
of maker businesses,
o-o
like the one
o-o
I work in,
o-o
'n the one
o-o
I'd like to build,
o-o
they're in the
o-o
political up.
o-o
Yet they pay high
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
'N get
o-o
few tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hey!
o-o
The economy's
o-o
like a bat
o-o
takin' a nap.
o-o
It's upside down!
o-o
We're taxin' the
o-o
fruitful makers
o-o
more than the
o-o
vulture takers!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes,
o-o
in some ways
o-o
the economic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see something
o-o
else!
o-o
Suppose law
o-o
offices
o-o
were taxed more.
o-o
Then lawyers
o-o
would earn less
o-o
than they do now.
o-o
That means some smart
o-o
pre hyphen-here law students
o-o
would abandon
o-o
their path to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs as lawyers,
o-o
and instead choose
o-o
career paths
o-o
that lead to
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
where their
o-o
salaries would be
o-o
better than now
o-o
because maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
would be taxed less.
o-o
That job migration
o-o
would use U.S.
o-o
brainpower
o-o
more efficiently,
o-o
for better
o-o
widespread
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the same thing
o-o
would happen with
o-o
people being
o-o
less attracted
o-o
to soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs on Wall Street.
o-o
But wait a
o-o
minute.
o-o
...
o-o
I think that might
o-o
mean a lower
o-o
salary for me
o-o
'cause I'm not
o-o
a smart guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Does this guy
o-o
really not know how
o-o
smart he is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He hasn't done
o-o
much reading so
o-o
he's not book smart.
o-o
But he's very smart
o-o
in common sense.
o-o
Which is all too
o-o
uncommon,
o-o
alas.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I'm so smart,
o-o
why'd I flunk
o-o
out of community
o-o
college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because you've got
o-o
a reading
o-o
disability
o-o
that schools
o-o
don't test for.
o-o
That makes schools
o-o
stupid.
o-o
Not you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My world's
o-o
so upside down.
o-o
In so many ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's fix that.
o-o
What's still
o-o
confusing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I keep hearing
o-o
the economy's
o-o
on the climbing
o-o
path of a
o-o
roller coaster.
o-o
But I'm in
o-o
one of the cars
o-o
that's derailed,
o-o
and I'm
o-o
plunging
o-o
fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The stock market
o-o
keeps going up and up
o-o
because people
o-o
with money have
o-o
few other places
o-o
to invest it.
o-o
Specifically
o-o
certificates
o-o
of deposit
o-o
haven't been
o-o
yielding much
o-o
interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I suppose
o-o
that gives
o-o
the stock market
o-o
sort of a
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So stocks are
o-o
like an
o-o
over-inflated
o-o
balloon.
o-o
Does that mean our
o-o
roller coaster
o-o
ride will soon
o-o
plummet?
o-o
And the poor
o-o
will all die?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's difficult
o-o
to predict when
o-o
it will drop
o-o
from its
o-o
recent
o-o
top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You said
o-o
economists
o-o
predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Knowing begin-italics what end-italics will
o-o
happen is
o-o
different
o-o
from knowing begin-italics when end-italics
o-o
those whats will
o-o
happen.
o-o
Professors
o-o
of economics
o-o
focus on
o-o
rational
o-o
behavior.
o-o
But successful
o-o
investors earn
o-o
lots of money
o-o
by knowing the
o-o
stock market
o-o
can stay
o-o
irrational
o-o
longer than
o-o
investors
o-o
can stay
o-o
solvent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
o-o
Economists
o-o
assume people
o-o
are smart.
o-o
This explains why
o-o
they,
o-o
and you,
o-o
probably
o-o
aren't wealthy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Our math proofs
o-o
do have
o-o
some goofs.
o-o
After all,
o-o
measuring
o-o
stupidity
o-o
is tricky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of
o-o
morons,
o-o
why doesn't
o-o
the economy
o-o
work for
o-o
hard workers
o-o
like me?
o-o
The numbers lie.
o-o
They say
o-o
everything's
o-o
hunky dory.
o-o
Is this an example
o-o
of mathiness?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I don't know what
o-o
mathiness is.
o-o
But numbers can
o-o
be deceptive.
o-o
What many people
o-o
overlook is that
o-o
the unemployment
o-o
rate that's in the news
o-o
just counts people
o-o
who are now getting
o-o
unemployment
o-o
benefits.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Those benefits
o-o
run out after a
o-o
few months of having
o-o
no job. I've learned
o-o
that from
o-o
experience.
o-o
So unemployment
o-o
is actually higher,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, it's higher.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why don't economists
o-o
measure that?
o-o
The real unemployment
o-o
rate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The government
o-o
does measure that
o-o
as well.
o-o
But most
o-o
newspapers and
o-o
TV stations
o-o
report the
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate
o-o
that
o-o
government
o-o
officials call
o-o
attention to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since wealthy
o-o
business owners
o-o
own news sources,
o-o
they probably
o-o
tell their
o-o
reporters
o-o
to report the
o-o
lower rate.
o-o
That gives
o-o
consumers
o-o
the confidence
o-o
to spend dollars
o-o
more freely.
o-o
And that gives
o-o
the wealthy
o-o
more sales,
o-o
more money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought it was
o-o
just the
o-o
government
o-o
being sneaky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's both.
o-o
The government
o-o
knows that if they
o-o
call attention
o-o
to the higher
o-o
actual
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate,
o-o
then consumers
o-o
will have less
o-o
optimism.
o-o
And when there's
o-o
less optimism
o-o
consumers
o-o
spend less money,
o-o
and that loops
o-o
back through
o-o
businesses
o-o
to fewer jobs
o-o
and lower
o-o
salaries
o-o
for other
o-o
employees,
o-o
who then spend
o-o
less money.
o-o
That's a powerful
o-o
feedback loop.
