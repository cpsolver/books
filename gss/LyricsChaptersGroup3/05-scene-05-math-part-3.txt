Let's try a
o-o
different
o-o
scenario.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's suppose
o-o
you're in the
o-o
audience at
o-o
a talent contest,
o-o
and the emcee
o-o
announces that
o-o
the loudness
o-o
of clapping
o-o
will determine
o-o
who wins.
sentence-next
o-o
How can you get
o-o
extra influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nor do I.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You could clap
o-o
really loud for
o-o
your favorites,
o-o
and just pretend
o-o
to clap for the
o-o
others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be
o-o
cheating.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a talent
o-o
contest, maybe,
o-o
maybe not.
sentence-next
o-o
At theater
o-o
events, that's
o-o
disrespectful.
sentence-next
o-o
But in an
o-o
election, with
o-o
money on the line,
o-o
that's just freedom
o-o
of expression.
sentence-next
o-o
It's voting,
o-o
but with an unfair
o-o
kind of vote
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, it's fighting!
sentence-next
o-o
Done on ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So when I rate
o-o
things on Amazon
o-o
I should only
o-o
use one star
o-o
or five stars?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you do that
o-o
on Amazon
o-o
you're being a
o-o
jerk.
sentence-next
o-o
But if that star
o-o
rating were used
o-o
in elections,
o-o
where so much
o-o
is at stake,
o-o
that tactic
o-o
would make
o-o
your ballot
o-o
have more impact
o-o
than ballots
o-o
marked
o-o
honestly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm still following
o-o
things to here.
sentence-next
o-o
Too bad I can't
o-o
celebrate with
o-o
a beer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Bravo!
sentence-next
o-o
You see that
o-o
just collecting
o-o
more information
o-o
isn't enough.
sentence-next
o-o
How the information
o-o
is counted to
o-o
identify a
o-o
winner is so
o-o
important to
o-o
get right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the five star
o-o
method won't work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah,
o-o
I should
o-o
shine light
o-o
on the concept
o-o
that there are
o-o
two parts
o-o
to any
o-o
voting method.
sentence-next
o-o
There's the ballot
o-o
and there's the
o-o
counting of those
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What kind'a ballot
o-o
do we use
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost
o-o
every nation in the
o-o
world uses what's
o-o
increasingly called
o-o
the single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'Cause we can
o-o
only mark a
o-o
single choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's just
o-o
one way to count
o-o
that kind of ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
Which is why
o-o
until recently
o-o
that ballot didn't
o-o
have a name.
sentence-next
o-o
The counting method
o-o
has different names.
sentence-next
o-o
It's the enemy
o-o
of fair voting
o-o
so it's worth
o-o
learning its names.
sentence-next
o-o
In the academic
o-o
world it's called
o-o
begin-italics plurality voting end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
In Canada
o-o
and other
o-o
British places
o-o
it's called
o-o
begin-italics first past the post end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it called
o-o
here in the states?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's just called
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah! With no name
o-o
it becomes harder
o-o
to fight against!
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine protesting
o-o
with a sign that says
o-o
begin-italics End That Unnamed
o-o
Bad Kind Of
o-o
Vote Counting end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that's the
o-o
enemy?
sentence-next
o-o
Plurality?
sentence-next
o-o
And it uses
o-o
the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Using those for
o-o
democracy
o-o
is like
o-o
using a stick
o-o
attached to
o-o
a round piece of
o-o
cardboard
o-o
as an
o-o
umbrella.
sentence-next
o-o
It works
o-o
for a bit,
o-o
until it
o-o
doesn't.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the name
o-o
of a ballot where
o-o
each candidate
o-o
can be ranked at
o-o
a different level,
o-o
like on Amazon?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Academically
o-o
that's called a
o-o
ranked ballot,
o-o
or a score ballot,
o-o
depending on
o-o
how it's counted.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain freeze
o-o
big time!
sentence-next
o-o
Is that difference
o-o
really of prime
o-o
importance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To get the math
o-o
right, yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But both types
o-o
are better than
o-o
what we use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't anything
o-o
better than what
o-o
we use now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost anything.
sentence-next
o-o
There's one
o-o
seductive
o-o
exception.
sentence-next
o-o
That's giving
o-o
each voter
o-o
a limited
o-o
number of points
o-o
to distribute
o-o
among the
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that because
o-o
a jerk could give
o-o
all his points
o-o
to a single
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's one
o-o
of its flaws.
sentence-next
o-o
If vote counting
o-o
methods
o-o
competed in
o-o
a limbo contest,
o-o
that points approach
o-o
would win.
sentence-next
o-o
It goes the
o-o
lowest
o-o
in fairness.
sentence-next
o-o
Anything else
o-o
is like
o-o
pole vaulting
o-o
over what we
o-o
use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So using ballots
o-o
that are like
o-o
Amazon stars ....
sentence-next
o-o
Wait a moment.
sentence-next
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
voting has to be
o-o
done electronically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That wouldn't
o-o
be fair.
sentence-next
o-o
Someone

Paper ballots,
o-o
with ovals to mark,
o-o
work just fine.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course
o-o
columns of ovals
o-o
are needed for the

preference levels.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's say there's

seven columns.
sentence-next
o-o
The columns
o-o
would be labeled

begin-italics first choice end-italics no-space ,
o-o

o-o
begin-italics third choice end-italics no-space ,

and so on up to

begin-italics seventh choice end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
That's called
o-o
a ranked choice
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What happens
o-o
if a joker
o-o
or dumb ass
o-o
marks more than
o-o
one oval
o-o
for the same
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Just count
o-o
the highest rank.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Suppose a

to mark

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That candidate
o-o
is ranked at
o-o
the bottom.
sentence-next
o-o
In this case
o-o
that's the
o-o
begin-italics
seventh choice
end-italics

end-lyric

What happens
o-o
if I rank
o-o
two
o-o
candidates
o-o
at the same

choice level?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That can be
o-o
counted
o-o
correctly,
o-o
as long as
o-o
lazy counting
o-o
shortcuts
o-o
aren't involved.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think even
o-o
I could mark
o-o
that kind of
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Anyone who can't
o-o
is too stupid
o-o
to be voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You're sayin'
o-o
some ways
o-o
of counting
o-o
those ballots
o-o
are better
o-o
than others?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly!
sentence-next
o-o
If everyone is
o-o
honest, then
o-o
simple counting
o-o
works fine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Simple counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If there are
o-o
five choice columns,
o-o
a marked oval
o-o
in the begin-italics first choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
five Amazon stars,
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics second choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
four Amazon stars,
o-o
and so on down to
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics fifth choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
one Amazon star.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's simple?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A computer
o-o
would take care of doing
o-o
that counting.
sentence-next
o-o
You would just mark
o-o
the correct column
o-o
for each
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Even hand counting
o-o
the ballots
o-o
that way
o-o
would be easy.
sentence-next
o-o
For simple counting
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the highest
o-o
such count
o-o
would win.
sentence-next
o-o
If everyone
o-o
is honest,
o-o
and ranks just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
at each level,
o-o
then that
o-o
works fine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Fat chance of that!
sentence-next
o-o
Honesty I mean.
sentence-next
o-o
It seems to be
o-o
getting

Congress,

and dating.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes when money
o-o
is involved,
o-o
as it is in
o-o
politics,
o-o
that simple way
o-o
of counting
o-o
ratings is
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to strategic

voters.
sentence-next
o-o
They can get
o-o
extra

o-o
using the

the middle

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm curious.

What happens

when Amazon

customers
o-o
realize they

can get extra

influence by
o-o
skipping the
o-o
middle ratings?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Amazon
o-o
stopped using
o-o
simple counting,
o-o
so it's less
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to that
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm confused.

I understand
