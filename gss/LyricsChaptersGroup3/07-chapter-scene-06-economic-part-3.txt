A feedback loop

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A small number

Ah,
o-o
I think I see.
sentence-next

It's vote

one nominee

sentence-next
o-o
And having

o-o
allows

the blocking tactic,

election.
sentence-next
o-o
And vote
o-o
splitting

elections
o-o
allows money

to control
o-o

the party's

And it blocks

third parties

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

that's what

The secret was singing?
end-lyric

At that time

It illustrates

that breakthroughs

One way to fight

end-lyric

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Democracy

Feedback loops

something

sentence-next
o-o
But it depends

sentence-next
o-o
It can even be

both good and bad

for the same

person,
o-o
like when
o-o
Henry Ford

paid his workers

higher than

sentence-next
o-o
That increased

his labor costs,

which brought in

is widely
o-o
known to be
o-o
a very stupid
o-o
idea,
o-o
for self hyphen-here interest
o-o
reasons.
sentence-next
o-o
So there's time
o-o
to get
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
adopted in
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
And doing that
o-o
should be
o-o
easier than
o-o
what early
o-o
North American
o-o
colonists
o-o
had to do
o-o
to get
o-o
democracy.
sentence-next
o-o
They had to fight
o-o
with physical
o-o
weapons.
sentence-next
o-o
And they won
o-o
mostly because
o-o
France and Spain
o-o
and the Dutch
o-o
all fought against
o-o
England at
o-o
the same time
o-o
the thirteen
o-o
colonies
o-o
were fighting for
o-o
independence
o-o
from England.
sentence-next
o-o
Now the fights
o-o
occur in
o-o
cyberspace
o-o
and in the news.
sentence-next
o-o
Those fights
o-o
don't risk
o-o
your life.
sentence-next
o-o
And they're
o-o
winnable.

some light ahead.
sentence-next
o-o
You've shown us
o-o
a path to
o-o
better times.
sentence-next
o-o
I guess we just
o-o
need to fight
o-o
against some
o-o
feedback
o-o
loops.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones that
o-o
say we should
o-o
jump for joy
o-o
when a house
o-o
burns down.
end-lyric

Now I see hope
o-o
for creating
o-o
ways to earn
o-o
more money
o-o
by making
o-o
things of
o-o
value.
sentence-next
o-o
But now my head's

ready to

become a

display.

o-o
we're so grateful
o-o
you've given us
o-o
so much wisdom.
sentence-next
o-o
I now understand
o-o
why so much
o-o
of what I
o-o
learned in school
o-o
now seems like snow
o-o
on a sunny
o-o
hillside.
sentence-next
o-o
It's long gone.
sentence-next
o-o
But this,
o-o
what you're
o-o
teaching us,
o-o
reveals
o-o
so many
o-o
secrets
o-o
that lie beneath
o-o
puzzling
o-o
mysteries,
o-o
of why things are
o-o
the way they are.
sentence-next
o-o
So I think
o-o
I'll remember
o-o
most of it
o-o
for a long time.
end-lyric

It's a joy to
o-o
really get to teach
o-o
what's important!

grandchildren.
sentence-next
o-o
And get it right!
sentence-next
o-o
Less corruption
o-o
would help
o-o
nearly everyone.
sentence-next
o-o
And the few who
o-o
lose will still
o-o
have their huge
o-o
bank accounts,
o-o
so they and their
o-o
families won't
o-o
suffer.
sentence-next
o-o
And then it will
o-o
spread to other
o-o
countries around
o-o
the world where
o-o
suffering is
o-o
even worse.
sentence-next
o-o
And that will help
o-o
the children
o-o
and grandchildren
o-o
of my nieces
o-o
and nephews.
sentence-next
o-o
They live in India.
sentence-next
o-o
In advance
o-o
thank you for
o-o
helping their
o-o
offspring
o-o
and mine.

the three hyphen-here hour drive

to come meet

with you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good luck!

any of this from me.
end-lyric

We know how this works,

so we promise!

let's talk this stuff over

on the ride back home,

So it remains

inside

our brains.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That plus more
