...
o-o
with a full

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a

foolish tactic
o-o
against a

boa constrictor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're fighting
o-o
against fear.
sentence-next
o-o
This will be
o-o
easier.
sentence-next
o-o
So far we've
o-o
been talking
o-o
about how to
o-o
choose a
o-o
mayor,
o-o
governor,
o-o
or president
o-o
with fairness.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the first half.
sentence-next
o-o
But what happens
o-o
when there are
o-o
lots of seats
o-o
to fill,
o-o
like in
o-o
Congress?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain overload!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh right.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead, try this.
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine a
o-o
group of friends
o-o
eating together
o-o
and choosing
o-o
two pizzas.
sentence-next
o-o
If the majority
o-o
want a
o-o
pork sausage
o-o
topping,
o-o
and about
o-o
a third of
o-o
the friends are
o-o
Jewish,
o-o
how should the
o-o
topping
o-o
for the second
o-o
pizza
o-o
be chosen?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In the non hyphen-here math
o-o
verse,
o-o
they would start
o-o
a holy war.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't the

second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate,
o-o
er, topping,
o-o
be elected,
o-o
er,
o-o
selected?
sentence-next
o-o
For the second
o-o
pizza.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular has
o-o
more than one
o-o
meaning.
sentence-next
o-o
So let's try
o-o
yet another
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
five wolves and
o-o
four sheep vote
o-o
on what to eat
o-o
for dinner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ha! The five wolves
o-o
would eat the
o-o
four sheep!
sentence-next
o-o
And claim it's fair
o-o
because it's
o-o
democracy!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So us
o-o
minorities,
o-o
like the sheep,
o-o
need a way to
o-o
fight against a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Bill of Rights
o-o
is nice,
o-o
but that's
o-o
not enough
o-o
to protect us
o-o
minorities
o-o
from white
o-o
supremacists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
As you see,
o-o
just getting a
o-o
majority
o-o
is just part of
o-o
the big picture.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought you were
o-o
showing us
o-o
everything on
o-o
a twelve hyphen-here foot
o-o
TV screen.
sentence-next
o-o
Where on the screen
o-o
should we
o-o
be looking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see somethin'.
sentence-next
o-o
If districts
o-o
were filled with
o-o
wolves 'n sheep,
o-o
'n each district
o-o
had slightly more
o-o
wolves than sheep,
o-o
then every
o-o
district would
o-o
elect a wolf.
sentence-next
o-o
Then Congress would
o-o
be nothin' but wolves.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's not far from
o-o
what are now
o-o
mostly
o-o
white males.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In Europe,
o-o
instead of just
o-o
wolves and sheep,
o-o
they have a
o-o
handful of
o-o
political parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like wolves and sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sure.
sentence-next
o-o
On the ballot
o-o
each voter marks their
o-o
favorite
o-o
political party.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's say
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
mark their
o-o
ballot for
o-o
the Pirate
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'd join that one.
sentence-next
o-o
It sounds like
o-o
they're against
o-o
puppets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do they slash
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
with their
o-o
swords?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They don't carry
o-o
swords,
o-o
or dress like
o-o
pirates.
sentence-next
o-o
But they do
o-o
oppose
o-o
what they think is
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Go pirates!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In some
o-o
European
o-o
countries,
o-o
adjustments
o-o
are done to
o-o
ensure the
o-o
Pirate party
o-o
and other
o-o
non hyphen-here tiny
o-o
parties
o-o
get their fair share
o-o
of seats in
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It hides the
o-o
unfairness of
o-o
still using
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet lots of
o-o
people like it
o-o
because
o-o
it yields
o-o
what's called
o-o
begin-italics proportional
o-o
representation end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
So each voter
o-o
can point to
o-o
someone in
o-o
parliament
o-o
and claim their vote
o-o
helped elect
o-o
that MP,
o-o
er,
o-o
member of
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
From reading
o-o
news about
o-o
Europe those
o-o
governments
o-o
have as much
o-o
corruption
o-o
as us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
they focus on
o-o
the balance of power
o-o
between parties,
o-o
but they allow
o-o
party insiders
o-o
to control which
o-o
politicians
o-o
win the seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's corrupt!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So back here
o-o
in the United States,
o-o
suppose each district
o-o
had two
o-o
representatives
o-o
instead of one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would double
o-o
the size of
o-o
the house of
o-o
representatives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't that
o-o
be avoided
o-o
by making
o-o
each district
o-o
double the size?
sentence-next
o-o
And having half
o-o
as many districts?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Very good!
sentence-next
o-o
And using a fraction
o-o
no less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's like building
o-o
a staircase.
sentence-next
o-o
Half as many steps
o-o
means each step
o-o
is twice as high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're
o-o
stepping up
o-o
to design
o-o
a new Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course the
o-o
most popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
would win
o-o
the first seat.
sentence-next
o-o
In a
o-o
double hyphen-here sized
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So how's the
o-o
second seat filled?
sentence-next
o-o
In a way that's fair.
sentence-next
o-o
For the sheep,
o-o
and goats,
o-o
and pigs?
sentence-next
o-o
Or maybe I should say,
o-o
for women to get
o-o
the representation
o-o
we deserve.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Using simple math,
o-o
a computer can
o-o
calculate which
o-o
voters are 
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
by the first hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since that math
o-o
is simple,
o-o
I don't need to
o-o
hear about it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sweet!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The ballots
o-o
of those
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
voters
o-o
would have their
o-o
influence
o-o
greatly reduced.
sentence-next
o-o
Often all the
o-o
way to zero.
sentence-next
o-o
The remaining
o-o
voters still have
o-o
full influence
o-o
for their ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
is done again,
o-o
and the most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
wins the
o-o
second seat.
sentence-next
o-o
In this
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm guessing the
o-o
effect would be
o-o
to elect one
o-o
Republican
o-o
and one
o-o
Democrat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Typically yes,
o-o
assuming both
o-o
parties offer
o-o
good candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That means
o-o
there would be
o-o
more than just
o-o
one
o-o
Republican
o-o
'n one
o-o
Democrat
o-o
in the race?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes because
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
sentence-next
o-o
So we need
o-o
to allow
o-o
for the
o-o
possibility
o-o
that one
o-o
of the
o-o
parties
o-o
only offers
o-o
disliked
o-o
candidates,
o-o
while the other
o-o
party offers
o-o
better
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, if, say,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party only
o-o
offered puppet
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Pinoke
o-o
'n Oscar,
o-o
'n the Democratic
o-o
party offered
o-o
anti hyphen-here corruption
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Barack
o-o
'n Hypatia,
o-o
then both winners
o-o
could be Democrats?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This seems like a
o-o
winning
o-o
pole vault
o-o
over our low
o-o
limbo bar,
o-o
where we
o-o
are now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But if every district
o-o
elects one
o-o
Republican and
o-o
one Democrat,
o-o
then Congress
o-o
would be tied.
sentence-next
o-o
That's cockeyed.
sentence-next
o-o
The population
o-o
is not
o-o
evenly
o-o
divided
o-o
between the
o-o
two parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To fix that
o-o
unfair balance,
o-o
we make the
o-o
districts a little
o-o
bigger. And we
o-o
reserve a few
o-o
extra seats,
o-o
which are called
o-o
statewide seats.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we can do
o-o
the party hyphen-here based
o-o
adjustment to
o-o
figure out which
o-o
party deserves to win
o-o
each of those
o-o
statewide seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And party
o-o
insiders
o-o
will choose
o-o
whose butts
o-o
will fill
o-o
those seats?
sentence-next
o-o
That seems
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Lots of
o-o
European
o-o
nations
o-o
do it that way,
o-o
but you're right,
o-o
it's not fair.
