sentence-next
In the wild conclusion their worlds collide in surprising ways.
end-basic-paragraph
begin-basic-paragraph
Are you angry at the craziness going on in U.S. politics?
sentence-next
Are you frustrated that the United States Congress lacks a backbone and couldn't crawl it's way out of an open paper bag lying on its side?
sentence-next
Do you fear economic hard times, too many pandemic deaths, more school shootings, and overpriced access to kitten videos?
end-basic-paragraph
begin-basic-paragraph
This is the entertaining comic story of a young man named name-damien and a young woman named name-desha who together dig under many layers of political dung and entertaining distractions to uncover the secret tactic that wealthy business owners use to control politicians in both the Republican and Democratic parties.
end-basic-paragraph
begin-basic-paragraph

begin-comment Illustration:
early evening (end of workday),
small outdoor balcony, with metal railing, part of condominium building,
higher than first floor,
small round table with two outdoor chairs facing it,
another two identical chairs in corners of balcony,
Damien sitting somewhat slumped forward onto table with arms on table,
cup of tea or coffee on table in front of him,
his fiance standing on right side of table and facing him
and is holding coffee cup.
Damien is racially mixed with latino or Puerto Rican parent,
short, NOT handsome in face but healthy body shape,
wearing jeans and shirt that would be appropriate for a trade such as installing hardwood floors.
His fiance is somewhat good looking and later will appear with her father who owns a business that earns lots of money, so she should be somewhat nicely dressed but in casual attire, has healthy body shape but not too beautiful in face.

I see.
o-o
'N besides words
o-o
for mula and dough,
o-o
there're words
o-o
like banker,

accountant,
o-o
economist,
o-o

embezzler,
o-o
'n vulture
o-o

end-lyric

o-o
and part hyphen-here time
o-o
commodity

trader,
o-o
plus business
o-o
owner,
o-o
which are

what I am.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
money's damn

important.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Did you know
o-o
that long ago,
o-o
when writing
o-o
was new,
o-o
writing was used
o-o
for banking
o-o
and accounting?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That was before
o-o
my time.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
That way money
o-o
was stored in banks,
o-o
not in pockets
o-o
nor in bags
o-o
anymore.
o-o
That protected
o-o
traders from
o-o
pirates,
o-o
thieves, and
o-o
marauding
o-o
desperados.
o-o
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, pirates.
o-o
That was a
o-o
profession
o-o
back when
o-o
swashbuckling exams
o-o
were open
o-o
to the poor.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Pickpockets,
o-o
pirates, and
o-o
highway robbers
o-o
are becoming
o-o
as uncommon as
o-o
blue hyphen-here footed boobies.
o-o
Now that money

travels out of

sight at the

speed of light.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'N the modern
o-o
version of pirates
o-o
is lawyers?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Oh no,
o-o
today's lawyers
o-o
are like
o-o
ancient scribes.
o-o
They write
o-o
documents,
o-o
but on paper
o-o
instead of on
o-o
parchment,
o-o
or clay tablets,
o-o
or pyramid
o-o
walls.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So how do you
o-o
choose where to
o-o
put the money
o-o
you've got,
o-o
to get more?
o-o
So you don't
o-o
end up singing
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Besides side hyphen-here stepping
o-o
traps set by

o-o
I only invest
o-o
in high hyphen-here profit

o-o
The ones where I

become an

even bigger

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
How come you
o-o
don't invest in
o-o
businesses
o-o
that sell products
o-o
and services
o-o
that are the best?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
The high-profit one
o-o
has to compensate
o-o
for the other eight,
o-o
the ones that flop.
o-o
Like Enron,

you can brag about?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah, yes,
o-o
the unicorn.
o-o
The one that
o-o
swells my pockets
o-o
til they burst.
o-o
Missing out on
o-o
one of those
o-o
would be the worst.
o-o
Yes, one unicorn
o-o
in the forest
o-o
is worth more than
o-o
five zebras
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Zebras?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Those are the
o-o
small businesses
o-o
that march to
o-o
riches slowly,
o-o
by making
o-o
something that
o-o
consumers
o-o
readily want,
o-o
and selling
o-o
a quality
o-o
version at an
o-o
affordable
o-o
price.
o-o
They don't need our
o-o
venture capital
o-o
for big
o-o
marketing
o-o
blitzes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't the whole
o-o
business scene
o-o
about selling what
o-o
customers want?
o-o
Or crave,
o-o
like nicotine,
o-o
...
o-o
'n chocolate
o-o
milk
o-o
with Cheerios?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Sure money
o-o
can be used
o-o
to oppose
o-o
customer
o-o
dissatisfaction.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What I mean is,
o-o
well,
o-o
I'd like to
o-o
find fundin'
o-o
for a business
o-o
venture.
o-o
I've invented a
o-o
tool for cleanin'
o-o
leaf gutters,
o-o
without gettin'
o-o
on a ladder.
o-o
So I'll ask,
o-o
would ya invest
o-o
in a business
o-o
that sells the best
o-o
kind of tool
o-o
for that task?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Nah, that would
o-o
be harder
o-o
to advertise
o-o
than a cordless
o-o
bungee hyphen-here jumping
o-o
franchise.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Lots of people
o-o
get hurt
o-o
when they hit
o-o
the dirt
o-o
from fallin' off
o-o
a ladder while
o-o
cleanin'
o-o
a gutter.
o-o
Some land on
o-o
their head,
o-o
and end up dead.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
That's a great spin!
o-o
Fear of fallin'.
o-o
That's a fear that
o-o
would sell lots of
o-o
product.
o-o
Do you have
o-o
a patent?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I can't afford
o-o
that expense.
o-o
Thousands
o-o
of dollars,
o-o
that cost
o-o
is too
o-o
immense.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Many tens of
o-o
thousands of
o-o
bucks.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That sucks.
o-o
I couldn't afford
o-o
even a few hundred
o-o
dollars to ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Why would I
o-o
invest?
o-o
Not unless
o-o
there's a
o-o
barrier
o-o
against
o-o
competitors.
o-o
There's gotta
o-o
be a
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
Either
o-o
a legal
o-o
monopoly,
o-o
or some kind of
o-o
virtual
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
That way my
o-o
investment
o-o
doesn't
o-o
evaporate
o-o
like a raindrop
o-o
falling into
o-o
Death Valley.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So a workin'
o-o
prototype's
o-o
not enough?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Sorry to sound
o-o
tough,
o-o
but that's too
o-o
rough.
o-o
That's as useless
o-o
as a machine hyphen-here gun mount
o-o
on the back of
o-o
a golf cart.
o-o
What the biz needs
o-o
to succeed
o-o
is a big amount
o-o
of income,
o-o
plus customers and
o-o
testimonials.
o-o
Then we might
o-o
lay out some
o-o
funds.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If income I
o-o
already had,
o-o
I could self hyphen-here fund it.
o-o
'N with that
o-o
I could go to
o-o
a bank 'n ask
o-o
for a loan.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Ha,
o-o
the bank
o-o
officials
o-o
might nod
o-o
ernestly
o-o
instead of
o-o
groan
o-o
...
o-o
out loud.
o-o
They might even
o-o
encourage
o-o
you to open
o-o
an account,
o-o
and get you to
o-o
fill out a
o-o
few forms.
o-o
But when you've
o-o
stepped out
o-o
the door,
o-o
they'll wet
o-o
themselves with
o-o
laughter.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If I were to
o-o
buy a house
o-o
they'd loan for that.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
A mortgage,
o-o
hah.
o-o
It doesn't work
o-o
like that.
o-o
Instead
o-o
the bank
o-o
buys the
o-o
house.
o-o
Your down payment's
o-o
big enough
o-o
to pay for
o-o
a year of
o-o
law school.
o-o
So if soon
o-o
you lose your job
o-o
and miss a
o-o
payment,
o-o
a remittance,
o-o
or two,
o-o
they sell the house.
o-o
Then you and a
o-o
couple of
o-o
other
o-o
homeowners
o-o
have paid for a
o-o
banker's kid
o-o
to become
o-o
a lawyer.
o-o
That path leads to
o-o
homelessness,
o-o
unless you have
o-o
trustworthy
o-o
income.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So banks
o-o
don't loan
o-o
money?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
They still do
o-o
a bit,
o-o
occassionally.
o-o
Mostly now they're
o-o
high hyphen-here rolling gamblers
o-o
that make casinos
o-o
look like kids
o-o
playing a game
o-o
of Monopoly.
o-o
They make
o-o
big money
o-o
by buying and
o-o
selling, ah,
o-o
another word
o-o
for money,
o-o
derivatives.
o-o
Big things,
o-o
not small things.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What're
o-o
derivatives?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Those are contracts
o-o
on paper, or the
o-o
cyberspace
o-o
equivalent,
o-o
written by lawyers.
o-o
Lots of times
o-o
they're promises
o-o
to pay money if
o-o
something happens,
o-o
like if interest
o-o
rates rise or fall.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds
o-o
a lot like
o-o
gamblin'.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
It is.
o-o
And gambling,
o-o
that's what we
o-o
venture
o-o
capitalists
o-o
do too.
o-o
We supply
o-o
capital.
o-o
It's like those
o-o
ancient sea
o-o
voyages.
o-o
Someone had to
o-o
buy the ship,
o-o
pay sailors,
o-o
and stock up
o-o
on gruel
o-o
and limes,
o-o
before they could
o-o
sail from the dock.
o-o
Then, on return,
o-o
if they returned,
o-o
the cargo was
o-o
sold, and the
o-o
backer got his
o-o
share of the
o-o
gold.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'N the captain
o-o
'n crew got what?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
What they got was
o-o
a temporary pass
o-o
to the middle class.
o-o
Until they got
o-o
swindled,
o-o
badly beaten
o-o
in a
o-o
casino,
o-o
or stuck with
o-o
alimony
o-o
payments
o-o
that would fund
o-o
a small bank.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
But the backer
o-o
got more?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Of course, 'cause
o-o
he took the
o-o
biggest risk.
o-o
Remember there
o-o
were pirates.
o-o
And sometimes
o-o
the winds
o-o
were not brisk.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Those times
o-o
were cruel,
o-o
barbaric,
o-o
and excitin'.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
They were.
o-o
In those
o-o
ancient times
o-o
fighting was done
o-o
by soldiers.
o-o
Now fighting
o-o
is so much
o-o
safer.
o-o
It's done by
o-o
lawyers
o-o
fighting with
o-o
legal
o-o
documents
o-o
instead of
o-o
swords.
o-o
And instead of
o-o
wearing armour,
o-o
or bullet hyphen-here proof
o-o
vests,
o-o
they wear
o-o
colorful
o-o
neckties,
o-o
or Victoria's
o-o
Secret
o-o
lingerie.
o-o
Quite civilized
o-o
nowadays.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see
o-o
how money works.
o-o
So how can I
o-o
switch from bein'
o-o
an employee
o-o
to become
o-o
an employer?
o-o
Ownin' a small
o-o
business,
o-o
that's my dream.
o-o
Some success,
o-o
financially,
o-o
so I can buy
o-o
a fixer hyphen-here upper house,
o-o
pay for ultra hyphen-here fast
o-o
access to,
o-o
er, ...,
o-o
kitten videos,
o-o
'n drive a car
o-o
that didn't come off
o-o
Henry Ford's
o-o
production line.
o-o
Not a
o-o
private jet.
o-o
Not even just
o-o
a log cabin
o-o
in the woods.
o-o
Not yet.
o-o
I just want
o-o
fair rewards
o-o
for my hard work.
o-o
How do I
o-o
make that leap?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
You need to
o-o
dig deep,
o-o
to develop
o-o
a compelling
o-o
vision.
o-o
A lofty one
o-o
that will
o-o
inspire.
o-o
Then you hire
o-o
workers who
o-o
follow your
o-o
vision like
o-o
ducklings behind
o-o
their mom.
o-o
You work them hard.
o-o
You hire lawyers
o-o
to sue
o-o
competitors.
o-o
And of course you
o-o
hire marketing
o-o
folks who
o-o
super hyphen-here size
o-o
your PR
o-o
blitzes.
o-o
They'll make
o-o
ads that are
o-o
so grand
o-o
that consumers
o-o
will trust
o-o
your brand.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So I should
o-o
start a cult?
o-o
'N of course
o-o
there'd be
o-o
an app
o-o
with that.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
That might put you
o-o
on the wealthy
o-o
map.
o-o
If you shift
o-o
the idolotry
o-o
to money.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
It sounds like
o-o
makin' money
o-o
is about lyin'
o-o
'n cheatin'.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
It's not lying.
o-o
That's not cheating.
o-o
It's marketing
o-o
and stepping on
o-o
toes.
o-o
In fact
o-o
anything goes.
o-o
But not lying
o-o
and cheating.
o-o
'Cause
o-o
that lands you in
o-o
the slammer.
o-o
That'd be a
o-o
bummer
o-o
'cause
o-o
your bank accounts
o-o
can't protect you
o-o
when you drop
o-o
the shared
o-o
bar of soap
o-o
in the prison
o-o
shower.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
To get ahead
o-o
financially
o-o
I have to step
o-o
on people's toes?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Or a gentle push
o-o
to the nose.
o-o
Business is all about
o-o
competition.
o-o
It's the very
o-o
foundation
o-o
of a free market.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Stomping on toes.
o-o
Anything goes.
o-o
That's the trick of
o-o
corporations.
o-o
How come they're the
o-o
winners in the
o-o
business world?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah,
o-o
the key is
o-o
politics.
o-o
We shareholders
o-o
and investors
o-o
give money to
o-o
politicians.
o-o
Then to us
o-o
they listen.
o-o
That's not cheating.
o-o
It's not against
o-o
any law.
o-o
I share mula with
o-o
any politician
o-o
who passes laws
o-o
that dump big
o-o
amounts of
o-o
golden coins
o-o
into my
o-o
bank accounts.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
After your
o-o
money buys
o-o
you a louder
o-o
voice,
o-o
in politics,
o-o
what do ya get
o-o
from the politicians
o-o
you buy?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Tax breaks and
o-o
subsidies.
o-o
And sometimes
o-o
legal monopolies.
o-o
Oh I do
o-o
love these.
o-o
With these breaks,
o-o
my business
o-o
thrives.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
But not so
o-o
for others' lives.
o-o
The customers.
o-o
The employees.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
If someone else
o-o
gets beaten,
o-o
that's their choice.
o-o
They need to speak up
o-o
with a louder voice.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Don't you fear
o-o
the folks who
o-o
want to tax
o-o
the wealthy?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
The business
o-o
that I
o-o
closely own,
o-o
with more profit
o-o
it could buy
o-o
a beach house,
o-o
or ski lodge,
o-o
or yacht.
o-o
Something I
o-o
don't yet got.
o-o
My biz buddies
o-o
and I would
o-o
share it.
o-o
Or rent it to me
o-o
for almost free.
o-o
That tactic
o-o
evades hefty
o-o
income
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
So an extra
o-o
tax on the rich,
o-o
it misses me.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So the key is
o-o
ownin' a biz?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Indeed.
o-o
And getting
o-o
on a board
o-o
of directors
o-o
is another
o-o
sweet gig.
o-o
Three businesses
o-o
pay me to
o-o
travel to their
o-o
board meetings.
o-o
There we vote
o-o
to reduce
o-o
labor costs.
o-o
Then,
o-o
using big
o-o
profits from the
o-o
previous year's
o-o
decision,
o-o
we vote for
o-o
huge bonuses
o-o
for ourselves.
o-o
That's sandwiched within
o-o
a resort vacation.
o-o
At a fancy spot
o-o
where I lounge for days
o-o
with a date who's hot.
o-o
Or at least I
o-o
rent a Beemer
o-o
convertible
o-o
and indulge
o-o
in rich meals
o-o
with someone like
o-o
flirty
o-o
Felicity
o-o
Dimwittle.
o-o
Plus I do
o-o
some side deals.
o-o
And most of it's
o-o
deductible,
o-o
another
o-o
money word
o-o
that brings me joy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So the tax breaks
o-o
and subsidies
o-o
are for
o-o
companies.
o-o
The ones you own,
o-o
or own shares of?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Yup.
o-o
The paperwork's
o-o
a hassle,
o-o
but those sly tricks
o-o
are legal.
o-o
All because
o-o
we pay off
o-o
politicians.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Don't lawyers
o-o
also assist?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Yes our lawyers
o-o
fight battles
o-o
in court.
o-o
They exterminate
o-o
our enemies.
o-o
But nowadays
o-o
no blood is shed.
o-o
The loser
o-o
only suffers
o-o
financially.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
It seems the
o-o
lawyers at the
o-o
top of the
o-o
legal
o-o
food chain
o-o
always win.
o-o
Why's that?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
They write the bills
o-o
that get passed
o-o
into law.
o-o
So of course they
o-o
know where the
o-o
loopholes are.
o-o
It's all a big
o-o
family.
o-o
I do love it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
When you get
o-o
tax breaks,
o-o
or legal
o-o
monopolies,
o-o
how big are they?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Usually
o-o
at least
o-o
three dollars.
o-o
Often twenty.
o-o
Sometimes,
o-o
oh the really
o-o
really good ones,
o-o
they're more than
o-o
a hundred.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that all?
o-o
Only about twenty
o-o
dollars?
o-o
After donating
o-o
hundreds or
o-o
even thousands
o-o
of dollars?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Three or twenty
o-o
or a hundred
o-o
dollars is
o-o
per dollar spent.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
You mean ...
o-o
for each dollar
o-o
you contribute ....
o-o
You mean,
o-o
let's say you give
o-o
fifty thousand
o-o
dollars.
o-o
Your business
o-o
can get
o-o
a million
o-o
dollars in
o-o
extra profits
o-o
because of the
o-o
tax breaks,
o-o
subsidies, or
o-o
legal
o-o
monopolies?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Yup!
o-o
It's a great
o-o
ROI.
o-o
That's
o-o
return on
o-o
investment.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
o-o
Amazing!
o-o
That's better
o-o
than ownin'
o-o
a Las Vegas
o-o
slot machine!
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Another trick
o-o
is to own
o-o
newspapers and
o-o
TV stations.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Those make out
o-o
like bandits?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
It's not for
o-o
their meager
o-o
profits.
o-o
That's so when there's
o-o
dirty linen
o-o
in a biz
o-o
we own
o-o
it doesn't
o-o
become known.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
How about
o-o
news sources
o-o
you don't own?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
The business buys
o-o
advertising spaces
o-o
from those places.
o-o
Have you noticed
o-o
that embarassing
o-o
stories about
o-o
grocery stores
o-o
never appear
o-o
in newspapers?
o-o
That's because
o-o
grocery stores
o-o
pay for lots
o-o
of those
o-o
colorful
o-o
newspaper
o-o
ads.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That protection
o-o
racket's not
o-o
what a small store
o-o
can afford to play.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
My dear boy,
o-o
there's no money
o-o
to be made by
o-o
aiming low.
o-o
It's big businesses
o-o
that earn the dough.
o-o
The really big
o-o
ones are chains
o-o
that use mass media
o-o
to broadcast their ads
o-o
across a big city,
o-o
or even a state.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I know someone
o-o
who wants to start
o-o
a restaurant.
o-o
Can't he buy ads
o-o
for just a neighborhood?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Only costly
o-o
printed ads
o-o
cover small
o-o
neighborhoods.
o-o
Well, 'til
o-o
recently,
o-o
when NextDoor and
o-o
News Here Now
o-o
came along.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Are there yet
o-o
other tricks?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Doing tricks
o-o
keeps a corporation
o-o
as busy as
o-o
an escort
o-o
in Las Vegas
o-o
during convention season.
o-o
Another trick is
o-o
big corporations
o-o
hire the big four
o-o
accounting firms
o-o
to get around laws
o-o
that were co-written
o-o
by those big four
o-o
accounting firms.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's, er,
o-o
a sweet deal.
o-o
For the
o-o
corporations.
o-o
But thinkin'
o-o
of me,
o-o
what's the best
o-o
kind of biz
o-o
to be?
o-o
I wanna
o-o
become an
o-o
entrepreneur.
o-o
What's the best
o-o
strategy?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
To become
o-o
a big cheeze,
o-o
put the squeeze
o-o
on customers.
o-o
Become the
o-o
bottleneck
o-o
between supply
o-o
and demand.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So you mean
o-o
extortion's
o-o
the best kind of
o-o
plan?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
To see what
o-o
I mean,
o-o
consider the
o-o
music industry.
o-o
The way it was
o-o
years ago,
o-o
before a
o-o
recording
o-o
studio
o-o
got squeezed
o-o
into a
o-o
laptop
o-o
computer.
o-o
Back then,
o-o
cutting
o-o
a record,
o-o
literally,
o-o
meant cutting grooves
o-o
on a master
o-o
disk.
o-o
That process
o-o
used very
o-o
expensive
o-o
equipment
o-o
to transform
o-o
sound waves
o-o
into vibrations
o-o
of the cutting
o-o
needle.
o-o
That equipment
o-o
was so rare
o-o
that musicians
o-o
would work for cheap.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Or trade sex
o-o
for a record deal?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Sometimes
o-o
that was a perk.
o-o
But times have changed.
o-o
Now a
o-o
microphone
o-o
and an iPad
o-o
plus some apps
o-o
can do it all.
o-o
From making
o-o
an album to
o-o
selling it
o-o
online.
o-o
So that pinch point,
o-o
that bottleneck,
o-o
is gone.
o-o
And with it went
o-o
lots of profit.
o-o
Now,
o-o
music hyphen-here industry
o-o
lawyers
o-o
hold their grip
o-o
by threatening
o-o
to sue any pub,
o-o
tavern, bar, or
o-o
restaurant
o-o
that doesn't buy
o-o
a license
o-o
to play the
o-o
copyrighted
o-o
music those
o-o
lawyers control.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
that's why we
o-o
can't sing the
o-o
Beatles song
o-o
begin-italics
Let It Be
end-italics
o-o
in public.
o-o
Now I see.
o-o
Record labels
o-o
lost their
o-o
bottleneck
o-o
because they
o-o
used to
o-o
monopolize
o-o
the
o-o
technology
o-o
that now fits
o-o
inside
o-o
a tablet
o-o
app.
o-o
Aren't newspapers
o-o
losing their
o-o
grip too?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
And movie
o-o
producers.
o-o
And book
o-o
publishers.
o-o
And radio
o-o
and TV
o-o
stations.
o-o
They lost their
o-o
monopolies.
o-o
Now those
o-o
industries
o-o
are like airplanes
o-o
dropping from
o-o
the sky in a
o-o
tailspin.
o-o
So the trick
o-o
is to find
o-o
a new
o-o
bottleneck.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Doesn't a patent
o-o
provide a
o-o
bottleneck?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
In theory,
o-o
yeah.
o-o
But really,
o-o
a patent
o-o
bottleneck
o-o
only works for
o-o
a big big
o-o
invention.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So inventing's
o-o
a dead end?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
If you could find
o-o
a genius
o-o
who could keep
o-o
your business
o-o
innovative
o-o
and out in front
o-o
of competitors,
o-o
that'd be sweet.
o-o
Very profitable.
o-o
But a
o-o
creative
o-o
genius is
o-o
rare and
o-o
doesn't work
o-o
for cheap.
o-o
And when you post
o-o
a job opening
o-o
like that,
o-o
the job
o-o
applicants are
o-o
pompus artists,
o-o
unemployed
o-o
writers, and
o-o
people like
o-o
ditsy
o-o
Dixie
o-o
Dinah from
o-o
North Carolina.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So the idea
o-o
behind a
o-o
monopoly
o-o
is to block
o-o
competitors?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
That's the key.
o-o
A technology
o-o
monopoly
o-o
or a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
are two of the
o-o
best.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
From what you said,
o-o
a business
o-o
you'd invest in
o-o
must be legal.
o-o
So why have you
o-o
been sayin'
o-o
legal
o-o
monopoly?
o-o
Instead of just
o-o
monopoly?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Legal monopoly
o-o
refers to a
o-o
monopoly
o-o
that's created
o-o
by a law.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
An example
o-o
would give me
o-o
a clue
o-o
'bout what you're
o-o
referrin'
o-o
to.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Have you heard
o-o
of an herb
o-o
named stevia?
o-o
It's a natural
o-o
sweetener.
o-o
There are laws
o-o
that block
o-o
stevia
o-o
from appearing
o-o
on grocery
o-o
shelves next to
o-o
sugar or
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners.
o-o
That protects
o-o
profits
o-o
for sugar
o-o
companies,
o-o
'n makers of
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So cookies
o-o
could be made
o-o
cheaper?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
It's better
o-o
in drinks
o-o
than baked goods.
o-o
But yeah,
o-o
sugar and
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners
o-o
have less
o-o
competition
o-o
because of
o-o
that law.
o-o
And speaking of
o-o
sugar,
o-o
long ago
o-o
Congress passed
o-o
a law against
o-o
buying sugar
o-o
that's grown
o-o
outside the U.S.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
an inside
o-o
scam.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Here in the states
o-o
we pay way more,
o-o
sometimes
o-o
almost twice
o-o
the price,
o-o
compared to
o-o
other
o-o
nations.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Coffee'd
o-o
taste sweeter
o-o
without that
o-o
price hike.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
And there are laws
o-o
that protect
o-o
drug companies
o-o
from the herbal
o-o
industry.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Drugs are
o-o
illegal.
o-o
But drug companies
o-o
are legal?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Not those drugs.
o-o
The legal kind.
o-o
Pharmaceuticals.
o-o
They avoid
o-o
competition
o-o
from herb
o-o
sellers
o-o
because laws
o-o
outlaw
o-o
health claims
o-o
for substances
o-o
that don't have
o-o
negative
o-o
side effects.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that mean
o-o
food also
o-o
can't claim
o-o
health
o-o
benefits?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
I admire your
o-o
mental
o-o
agility.
o-o
But don't get
o-o
too cheeky.
o-o
In addition
o-o
to that partial
o-o
legal
o-o
monopoly,
o-o
pharmaceutical
o-o
companies
o-o
get huge tax
o-o
deductions
o-o
because drug
o-o
testing
o-o
qualifies as
o-o
research.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Those are slick
o-o
tricks.
o-o
Especially
o-o
gettin' a law
o-o
that creates a
o-o
monopoly,
o-o
'cause it's
o-o
automatically
o-o
legal.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Did you know
o-o
that companies
o-o
like Turbo Tax
o-o
and Quickbooks
o-o
pay lobbyists
o-o
to keep tax laws
o-o
complex?
o-o
That increases
o-o
demand for
o-o
their services.
o-o
...
o-o
So now,
o-o
is all of this
o-o
making sense?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
As clear as mud
o-o
dried out on
o-o
a windshield.
o-o
Up close and
o-o
easy to see.
o-o
Thanks for the
o-o
clarity!
o-o
...
o-o
I do have
o-o
a question
o-o
about somethin'
o-o
you said.
o-o
Part hyphen-here time you
o-o
do some kind of
o-o
trading.
o-o
What's that?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Commodity
o-o
trading.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So you buy
o-o
and sell
o-o
kechup, mayo,
o-o
and mustard?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Those are
o-o
condiments.
o-o
Commodities
o-o
include sugar,
o-o
soybeans, wheat,
o-o
and oil.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's just some
o-o
certain kinds
o-o
of foods?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
By oil I mean
o-o
barrels of
o-o
crude oil.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's for
o-o
really hungry
o-o
people
o-o
with no taste?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Commodities
o-o
also include
o-o
gold, silver,
o-o
and copper.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What do jewlery
o-o
and food have
o-o
in common?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Those and other
o-o
things are
o-o
bought and sold
o-o
as raw materials.
o-o
In huge amounts,
o-o
like cargo
o-o
container
o-o
amounts.
o-o
Heating oil,
o-o
for furnaces,
o-o
goes up in price
o-o
at the beginning
o-o
of winter.
o-o
That's what I buy
o-o
online
o-o
while it's cheaper.
o-o
A week or two
o-o
later,
o-o
when the weather
o-o
is colder,
o-o
I click
o-o
a button
o-o
on my
o-o
trading app,
o-o
and I've earned
o-o
a nice
o-o
profit.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Could you teach me
o-o
that trick?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
The price
o-o
of a single
o-o
contract can
o-o
go up or down
o-o
by thousands
o-o
of dollars
o-o
within
o-o
an hour.
o-o
It's only for
o-o
those of us
o-o
who can afford
o-o
to wake up
o-o
and discover
o-o
it went the
o-o
wrong way
o-o
by tens
o-o
of thousands
o-o
of dollars.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Then back to
o-o
owning a
o-o
business.
o-o
For that
o-o
are there
o-o
other tricks?
o-o
For getting
o-o
big profits?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
As many as an
o-o
eagle has feathers.
o-o
Another is
o-o
slowing down
o-o
product
o-o
innovations.
o-o
If a product
o-o
takes too big
o-o
of a leap,
o-o
we miss out on
o-o
consumers
o-o
paying for each
o-o
slight
o-o
improvement.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the
o-o
most important
o-o
trick?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
That has to be
o-o
giving
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributions
o-o
to political
o-o
candidates.
o-o
After they
o-o
get re hyphen-here elected
o-o
they protect
o-o
the laws that give
o-o
our business
o-o
tax break after
o-o
tax break.
o-o
And they
o-o
protect our
o-o
legal
o-o
monopolies,
o-o
and
o-o
taxpayer hyphen-here funded
o-o
subsidies.
o-o
That's why big
o-o
businesses pay
o-o
six hyphen-here figure
o-o
salaries
o-o
so freely.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah yes, money
o-o
in politics.
o-o
I know 'bout that.
o-o
But I don't yet
o-o
understand
o-o
why us voters,
o-o
er,
o-o
...
o-o
how it works.
o-o
Non hyphen-here rich voters
o-o
greatly outnumber
o-o
the wealthy,
o-o
so how can
o-o
money
o-o
outweigh those votes?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
We've
o-o
infiltrated
o-o
both parties.
o-o
This is how we
o-o
control who wins
o-o
the primary
o-o
elections of
o-o
both parties.
o-o
So general
o-o
elections are
o-o
between a
o-o
puppet Republican
o-o
and a puppet
o-o
Democrat.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah, puppets win.
o-o
I knew that part.
o-o
But I hadn't
o-o
noticed the
o-o
infiltration
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
In the primary,
o-o
the winner's always
o-o
from the correct party,
o-o
so the money
o-o
bias goes
o-o
unchallenged.
o-o
In the
o-o
general
o-o
election
o-o
Republican
o-o
voters
o-o
assume
o-o
Democrats
o-o
are dimwits,
o-o
and Democratic
o-o
voters
o-o
assume
o-o
Republicans
o-o
are dimwits.
o-o
But then
o-o
it's too late.
o-o
For added
o-o
insurance
o-o
in a tight race
o-o
we might give a
o-o
bit of money
o-o
to the one we
o-o
hate.
o-o
But we give
o-o
far more to
o-o
the one we
o-o
choose.
o-o
That way we
o-o
can't lose.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
How come news
o-o
reporters
o-o
don't expose
o-o
what's behind
o-o
those magic
o-o
tricks?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
That flow of money
o-o
is harder to follow
o-o
than a mouse
o-o
running through
o-o
a cornfield.
o-o
Such as when
o-o
rich wives register
o-o
as Democrats
o-o
and give family money
o-o
to conservative
o-o
Democratic politicians
o-o
during primary elections.
end-lyric

There's somethin' else
o-o
going on
o-o
isn't there?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
You are bright!
o-o
Yes, we pay news sources
o-o
to entertain and
o-o

o-o
The biggest of
o-o
distractions are

those endless

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Religion?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Abortion is the

really useful one.
o-o
With that the

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So the Republican
o-o

o-o
really care 'bout
o-o
abortion?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
We sorta care,
o-o
but not as much
o-o
as tax breaks
o-o
and subsidies
o-o
and our legal
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I have to admit
o-o

o-o
through that.
o-o
They're so distracted

end-lyric

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
You've got my full

attention.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
As you know
o-o
there are names
o-o
for the left

and the right.
o-o
Names like
o-o
liberals,
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
capitalists,
o-o

o-o
And there's
o-o
name hyphen-here calling.
o-o
Names like

tree huggers,
o-o
socialists,
o-o
racists,
o-o
and dimwits.
o-o
Those
o-o
left hyphen-here and hyphen-here right names
o-o
entertainingly
o-o
distract
o-o
from the fact
o-o
that there's a
o-o
bigger
o-o
conflict.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's bigger than
o-o
the fight
o-o
between left 'n
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Allow me to

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
My brain
o-o
is open wide
o-o
'n ready to be

end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
The much bigger
o-o
fight is
o-o
between the

and the

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Political up?
o-o
Political down?
o-o
Where did
o-o
left and right
o-o
go to?
o-o
What's up?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
The political up,
o-o
that's where most
o-o
voters are.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Voters of which
o-o
party?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Both parties.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
How can that be?
o-o
Both Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
are in the
o-o
political up?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Stop thinking of
o-o
voters as
o-o
Republicans
o-o
and
o-o
Democrats.
o-o
It's us
o-o
politicians,
o-o
and the party
o-o
insiders,
o-o
who are
o-o
Republicans
o-o
and
o-o
Democrats.
end-lyric

Heck,
o-o
if this is news
o-o
to you,
o-o
maybe you too
o-o
have failed to
o-o
recognize
o-o
that both
o-o
parties are
o-o
controlled by
o-o
people who
o-o
utilize
o-o
money.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That part I knew.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
The biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
The biggest
o-o
contributors?
o-o
Should we
o-o
be puttin' down
o-o
fat people?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Not that kind
o-o
of biggest.
o-o
They give the
o-o
biggest amounts
o-o
of money.
o-o
They provide
o-o
the money source
o-o
that lifts us
o-o
politicians
o-o
high in the polls.
o-o
They've bought
o-o
our souls.
o-o
Without their dough
o-o
we get dashed
o-o
against the rocks
o-o
during a
o-o
primary.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
You're talkin' 'bout
o-o
rich folks,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Of course they're
o-o
all rich.
o-o
But some
o-o
of the rich
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
How can that be?
o-o
I'm as confused
o-o
as if I just
o-o
stepped out from an
o-o
industrial
o-o
laundry
o-o
washer
o-o
during the
o-o
high hyphen-here spin
o-o
cycle.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Confused by
o-o
the spin.
o-o
That's the state
o-o
most voters
o-o
are in.
o-o
That's the aim
o-o
of the
o-o
political
o-o
down.
o-o
So of course
o-o
they resist
o-o
adopting
o-o
a name.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
But among themselves
o-o
they call themselves
o-o
the political down?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
No, that's just
o-o
how I think of
o-o
them.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
This
o-o
upfront
o-o
lowdown is
o-o
blindingly
o-o
illuminatin'.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Of course the
o-o
political down
o-o
prefers our party,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That I can see.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
But also the
o-o
political down
o-o
has infiltrated
o-o
the Democratic
o-o
party.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoa!
o-o
How come the
o-o
political
o-o
down
o-o
donates money
o-o
to both
o-o
parties?
o-o
That's as stupid
o-o
as placin'
o-o
first hyphen-here place bets
o-o
on both horses
o-o
in a
o-o
two hyphen-here horse race.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Ah, here's a
o-o
big secret.
o-o
They mostly
o-o
only assist
o-o
Democratic
o-o
candidates
o-o
during begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
elections.
o-o
Of course I'm
o-o
simplifying
o-o
hugely.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, I see!
o-o
They use money
o-o
to influence
o-o
who wins each
o-o
Democratic
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
race.
o-o
But in the general
o-o
election
o-o
they just embrace
o-o
Republican
o-o
candidates?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Isn't it
o-o
brilliant?
o-o
Yet subtle.
o-o
Like a
o-o
gleeming hyphen-here smile
o-o
model in an
o-o
auto ad.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm
o-o
beginnin' to
o-o
see how come we,
o-o
er, most voters,
o-o
dislike both
o-o
candidates,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
begin-italics and end-italics the Democrat.
o-o
I don't mean
o-o
any
o-o
disrespect.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
We
o-o
politicians
o-o
expect
o-o
a lack of
o-o
respect.
o-o
We know we're stuck
o-o
in the middle.
o-o
Between voters
o-o
and our biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
o-o
Now do you see
o-o
why voters
o-o
are distracted
o-o
by the
o-o
entertaining
o-o
conflict
o-o
between left
o-o
and right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Instead of words
o-o
I need a
o-o
picture.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
It's sort of like
o-o
when ancient
o-o
Roman rulers
o-o
distracted
o-o
plebians with
o-o
bloody fighting
o-o
among slaves in
o-o
their immense
o-o
Colosseum.
o-o
Except that
o-o
modern hyphen-here day
o-o
plebians
o-o
get to vote
o-o
which slave,
o-o
er, puppet,
o-o
wins the staged fight.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like
o-o
pickin'
o-o
pockets
o-o
while
o-o
celebrities
o-o
are on stage?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
That's a bit rough.
o-o
But close enough.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
With their clout,
o-o
what's the
o-o
political down
o-o
really care
o-o
about?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Profits for the
o-o
businesses
o-o
they own.
o-o
What especially
o-o
delights them
o-o
are biz tax breaks.
o-o
And when they can
o-o
get a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
they cling to it
o-o
like a
o-o
Titanic
o-o
passenger
o-o
would clutch
o-o
a chunk of
o-o
styrofoam.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
o-o
Those business
o-o
owners pay
o-o
politicians
o-o
for lower taxes
o-o
'n no
o-o
competition.
o-o
That deal's sweet!
o-o
But that's
o-o
cheatin'.
o-o
It's corrupt.
o-o
Am I wrong?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
You're right.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm confused.
o-o
On the
o-o
political
o-o
right,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party seems to
o-o
care about some
o-o
non-business
o-o
issues like
o-o
abortions, and
o-o
gay marriage,
o-o
Christian values,
o-o
immigration,
o-o
'n such,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
They do glorify
o-o
those things on the
o-o
flag they fly.
o-o
But taxes, and
o-o
ideally
o-o
subsidies and
o-o
monopolies,
o-o
are their
o-o
real priorities.
o-o
That's because
o-o
party insiders,
o-o
in both parties,
o-o
get their
o-o
marching orders
o-o
from the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I think I'm
o-o
seein' how come
o-o
neither political
o-o
party really
o-o
gives a damn
o-o
'bout protectin'
o-o
coral reefs,
o-o
fixin' climate
o-o
change,
o-o
givin' homeless
o-o
folks an assist,
o-o
or listenin'
o-o
to what dolphins
o-o
have to say
o-o
about us
o-o
dumpin' trash
o-o
into their
o-o
swimmin' pool.
o-o
I see the
o-o
down folks
o-o
are usin'
o-o
religious
o-o
'n racial
o-o
issues
o-o
to divide 'n
o-o
distract.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Here's another
o-o
division tactic.
o-o
Money can fund
o-o
extreme liberal
o-o
agendas.
o-o
Like when the
o-o
LGB category
o-o
got extended.
o-o
To include
o-o
queers and
o-o
transgenders.
o-o
That scares voters
o-o
to the right.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
out of spite
o-o
many voters
o-o
blindly
o-o
believe
o-o
the enemy
o-o
of their
o-o
enemy
o-o
is their
o-o
friend.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
That's a powerful
o-o
political
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Here' something else
o-o
you should know.
o-o
It's easy
o-o
to hide the
o-o
giving of funds
o-o
to both sides,
o-o
left and right.
o-o
In fact there are
o-o
two brothers in
o-o
Florida in
o-o
the sugar biz.
o-o
One brother is
o-o
a Republican
o-o
who gives buckets
o-o
of money to
o-o
Republican
o-o
politicians.
o-o
The other brother
o-o
is a Democrat
o-o
who gives buckets
o-o
of money to
o-o
Democratic
o-o
politicians.
o-o
Ain't that sweet?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'N as hard to follow
o-o
as a rat
o-o
chased by
o-o
a cat.
o-o
So they don't
o-o
give a damn 'bout
o-o
left or right?
o-o
They just lobby
o-o
for sugar ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Subsidies.
o-o
Especially
o-o
the taxes
o-o
that pay for
o-o
the canals
o-o
that sustain
o-o
Florida farmers
o-o
who grow
o-o
sugarcane.
o-o
But the biggest
o-o
financial gain
o-o
comes from
o-o
converting
o-o
sugarcane into
o-o
sugar, and that's
o-o
what's done by the
o-o
businesses
o-o
those bros own.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a sour
o-o
deal for us.
o-o
How come this
o-o
isn't more
o-o
obvious?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
On commodity
o-o
price lists,
o-o
they used to list
o-o
sugar and
o-o
U.S. sugar
o-o
by those names.
o-o
But now
o-o
the names are
o-o
sugar number
o-o
eleven and
o-o
sugar number
o-o
sixteen.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a
o-o
slick trick.
o-o
Um,
o-o
there's somethin'
o-o
else that's a bit
o-o
fuzzy.
o-o
Don't some
o-o
rich folks
o-o
prefer the
o-o
Democratic
o-o
party?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Lots of lawyers
o-o
get lots of their
o-o
business from
o-o
Democratic voters,
o-o
so they like
o-o
Democratic
o-o
politicians.
o-o
And then there are
o-o
industries that
o-o
subdivide into
o-o
left and right.
end-lyric

end-lyric

Not goats.
o-o
Votes.
o-o
As in voting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Vote spittin'?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Not spitting,
o-o
although long ago
o-o
there was lots
o-o
of spitting in
o-o
politics.
o-o
It's splitting,
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
and it's the
o-o
election version
o-o
of divide and
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, vote splitting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
That's it!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'N divide 'n

o-o
Isn't that the

battle tactic
o-o
armies use when
o-o
they separate
o-o
enemy
o-o
soldiers from
o-o
one another?
o-o
'N then they can
o-o
attack the

smaller groups
o-o
when they're

end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes, and in fact,
o-o
voting is
o-o
rooted in war
o-o
and fighting.
o-o
That's why women
o-o
didn't vote.
o-o
They weren't counted
o-o
because they
o-o
didn't fight.
o-o
Of course,
o-o
those counting

end-lyric

end-lyric

That counting was
o-o
done to figure
o-o
out how many
o-o
men would be
o-o
in each gang.
o-o
And then the
o-o
smallest gangs
o-o
negotiate
o-o
and join forces.
o-o
Otherwise they
o-o
get slaughtered.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So the winner's
o-o
the side that
o-o
joins the most gangs
o-o
into just one
o-o
very big
o-o
army?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes, and the
o-o
remaining gangs
o-o
join together
o-o
to form the
o-o
opposition army.
o-o
So it comes down
o-o
to two armies.
o-o
And that's where
o-o
size matters.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so long ago
o-o
votin' began
o-o
as a way to

'N the smaller

army surrenders?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Saves a lot of dying,
o-o
no?
o-o
And when splitting
o-o
can't be done
o-o
physically,
o-o
then splitting
o-o
psychologically
o-o
works too.
o-o
In politics,
o-o
that's what
o-o
religious
o-o
differences
o-o
do.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So how does this
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
work?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Well, it involves
o-o
math.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o

o-o
mathematics?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Certainly.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
In my opinion
o-o
math's the devil's
o-o
favorite
o-o
form of torture.
o-o
If I had to
o-o
choose between
o-o
doin' just one page

o-o
or standin' under

And I don't

o-o
well enough to
o-o
clearly
o-o
explain how it
o-o
all works.
o-o
I just know that
o-o
it works.
o-o
So we, the
o-o
politicians,
o-o
are effectively
o-o
hobbled and
o-o
handcuffed
o-o
and gagged
o-o
when we cast
o-o

that a third-party

more than a

certain percent
o-o
of the vote?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Aha!
o-o
That's a tactic
o-o
to split votes
o-o
away from ...
o-o
well who?
end-lyric
ambee sings-politician amenn
Third parties are
o-o
almost always
o-o
on the left.
o-o
At least in the U.S.
o-o
Whenever needed
o-o
they're quietly
o-o
seeded with funds
o-o
from conservatives.
o-o
That splits votes
o-o
away from the
o-o
Democratic
o-o
nominee.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
o-o
It just affects the
o-o
distractin' balance

between left

end-lyric

And if a

o-o

conservative

on the single

This is simple.

Back when

There was just

The winning
o-o
strategy

came to be

for each party

o-o
The idea was
o-o
to discover
o-o
which politician

deserves

the solo spot.

In what

we now call
o-o
the general

No you can't

Chocolate chips,

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
To talk about
o-o
how come
o-o
politics is so

dysfunctional,
o-o
you said

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Damn right!
o-o
It's so so so
o-o
dysfunctional.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So,
o-o
do you know
o-o
about vote
o-o
splittin'?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What do goats
o-o
have to do with
o-o
politics?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Not goats.
o-o
Not spitting.
o-o
Vote splitting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Splitting votes
o-o
in half?
o-o
That's a half hyphen-here wit
o-o
idea.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Not splitting
o-o
ballots.
o-o
Splitting voters.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's murder.
o-o
Yes politicians
o-o
do murder
o-o
innocent people.
o-o
They write laws
o-o
that come from
o-o
Thomas Crapper's
o-o
brainchild.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's not what
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Then it sounds quite
o-o
esoteric.
o-o
What's important
o-o
is that the world
o-o
is suffering
o-o
under an
o-o
epidemic
o-o
of toxic
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
corruption's
o-o
so unfair.
o-o
It's like leavin'

o-o
toilet paper
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
It's zillions
o-o

o-o
than that.
o-o
Corruption
o-o
kills through
o-o
economic suffering
o-o
that leads to
o-o
suicide,
o-o
homicide,
o-o
and slow death
o-o
by fast food.
o-o
Corruption
o-o
kills by letting

gun makers push
o-o
assault rifles
o-o
into the hands of
o-o
bullies
o-o
like Big Bill
o-o
Bunderstock,
o-o
the Bethesda

o-o
And corruption
o-o
gives the green light
o-o
to cars killing
o-o
pedestrians.
o-o
And the companion

of corruption
o-o
is despair.
o-o
Life is so unfair.

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Tell me how you
o-o
think it makes

a difference.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
For instance,
o-o
suppose there's
o-o
four politicians.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What are their names?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
o-o
This is just a

o-o
politicians,

I'll give them
o-o
names.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Two of them are

o-o
The other two

promise to

reduce
o-o
corruption,
o-o
so they're more
o-o
well hyphen-here liked.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The names of the
o-o
first two are
o-o
Pinoke and
o-o
Oscar.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Could you explain
o-o
what's in your brain?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Pinoke is a
o-o
nickname for
o-o
Pinnochio,
o-o
the puppet.
o-o
And Oscar's last
o-o
name is the Grouch.
o-o
He lives in trash
o-o
just like corrupt
o-o
politicians.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'Kay.
end-lyric

The other two are

named Barack,

'cause we can hope

o-o
and Hypatia

should rule.
end-lyric

With these live

candidates,
o-o
two cruel,

o-o
who'd win?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Either Barack
o-o
or Hypatia,
o-o
the cool ones,
o-o
obviously.
o-o
'Cause voters want
o-o
less corruption.
o-o
Voters don't want
o-o
Pinoke,
o-o
don't want Oscar.
o-o
Don't want the
o-o
cruel ones.
o-o
They're the puppets

o-o
The turds.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Right.
o-o
The voters
o-o
get who they
o-o
favored.
o-o
But then
o-o
big hyphen-here money

o-o
arrive.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Now you'll say
o-o

o-o

o-o
Ones that

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Wealthy business
o-o
owners,
o-o
who're the biggest
o-o
campaign donors,
o-o
in private they choose
o-o
which puppet gets
o-o
their dollars.
o-o
If they like
o-o
the look of
o-o
Pinoke's nose,
o-o
then they propose
o-o
to Oscar
o-o
that he take
o-o
a hike
o-o
on the
o-o
Appalachian
o-o
trail.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That wouldn't fail
o-o
to make Oscar
o-o
a grouch.
o-o
What if he
o-o
should refuse?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They point out
o-o
he'll lose.
o-o
Without their

o-o
Or they bribe him
o-o
with favors,
o-o
if that's what

it takes.
end-lyric

o-o
That'd leave

Pinoke and

o-o

o-o
Who'd win that
o-o
three hyphen-here way race?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
would split their votes
o-o
between Barack
o-o

o-o
That would make

it easier for
o-o
Pinoke to reach

victory.

o-o
would be

photoshopped
o-o
to make his nose

o-o

o-o
That's unfair!

o-o
Yet,
o-o
more voters prefer
o-o
either Hypatia
o-o
or Barack.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's what I've
o-o
figured out.
o-o
But now I'm stuck.
o-o
I dunno how

o-o
so they don't suck.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
We can call attention

o-o

Who'd decide

which candidate

to boycott?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
We the voters
o-o
could get one to
o-o
vacate their spot,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd coax
o-o
the wealthiest

o-o
to quietly fund

who gets more than

end-lyric

I thought that

was a good thing.
o-o
Now I see
o-o
it's a bribe
o-o
that seduces
o-o
liberals
o-o
into splitting
o-o
their votes.
o-o
While conservatives
o-o
quietly concentrate

Entertain
o-o
with one hand
o-o
to distract
o-o
attention
o-o
away from the
o-o
other hand

that's doin'
o-o
the sneaky

trick.
end-lyric

Now that I
o-o
know the
o-o
Republican
o-o
party isn't
o-o
the real
o-o
enemy,
o-o
my anger's
o-o
getting thick.
o-o
So I need to
o-o
figure out,
o-o
and soon,
o-o
whose butt
o-o
I should kick.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I've found
o-o
the tipping point.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The place

them over?
o-o
Not that I've
o-o
ever,
o-o
well,
o-o
recently,
o-o
tried tipping
o-o
a cow.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
but that path's blocked.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Is it padlocked?
o-o
I can pick
o-o
some locks.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
It's a bigger
o-o
barrier.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What's the
o-o
blockage?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Math.
o-o
It's blockin' me
o-o
from findin'
o-o
the whackin'
o-o
point that'll
o-o
turn the world
o-o
right side up.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Math is dreary
o-o
to me.
o-o
Yet I got
o-o
as far as
o-o
algebra
o-o
and trig and
o-o
statistics
o-o
without
o-o
successfully
o-o
using my

o-o
What d'you wanna

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I wanna

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I don't know
o-o
how to get there.
o-o
But I do know
o-o
someone who
o-o
maybe can
o-o
unravel
o-o
that puzzle.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Wrong gender.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Who's she?
end-lyric

She's a math prof.

A professor

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes, at the state

o-o
That's where I got
o-o
my degree.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I couldn't cope
o-o
with even

o-o

my brain to

useless

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
But I'm not

o-o
Fighting

a bloodbath.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What took you

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm short

I think she can

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
It's what I need.
o-o
What d'you need?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
In my early
o-o
youth we were so
o-o
happy then,
o-o
even though
o-o
our home was
o-o
cramped,
o-o
and money
o-o
we lacked.
o-o
Then the world
o-o
turned upside down.
o-o
My smile
o-o
became a
o-o
frown.
o-o
I saw suffering
o-o
that I hadn't seen
o-o
before.
o-o
And I traced
o-o
the cause of
o-o
suffering to
o-o
corruption in
o-o
government.
o-o
Those ...
o-o
grrr
o-o
... politicians
o-o
are the puppets
o-o
of greedy
o-o
money huggers.
o-o
Now I want to
o-o
send them to hell,
o-o
those greedy
o-o
evil
o-o
muggers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Which ones?
o-o
The politicians
o-o
or the big
o-o
campaign contributors?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Whoever
o-o
is most to blame.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They're both clueless
o-o
from what I
o-o
can tell.
o-o
About why money
o-o
works so well
o-o
as puppet strings.
o-o
Can we fight
o-o
against cluelessness?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
If it would help to
o-o
carry a banner
o-o
that says begin-italics End 
o-o
Cluelessness Now end-italics
o-o
I will.
o-o
I'll fight against
o-o
whoever's to blame.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
How do you aim
o-o
to tame
o-o
the circus
o-o
...
o-o
of elephants
o-o
and donkeys
o-o
and voters?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I call on the spirits
o-o
of the dead here
o-o
to inspire me
o-o
to find a way
o-o
to shine a light
o-o
on corruption.
o-o
I want a light
o-o
that's so bright
o-o
that even evil
o-o
money huggers
o-o
and egotistic
o-o
puppets
o-o
cannot fight back.
o-o
Not with their wealth,
o-o
not with lawyers,
o-o
and not with
o-o
help from my
o-o
distant cousin
o-o
Dimley
o-o
who blogs for them
o-o
as a job.
o-o
I know that light
o-o
casts out darkness.
o-o
In that light
o-o
the path to better times
o-o
will appear.
o-o
Until that happens
o-o
I'll keep on
o-o
fighting.
o-o
Fighting with words.
o-o
Fighting with deeds.
o-o
Doing whatever it takes
o-o
to bring good times
o-o
back to us,
o-o
the voters, the
o-o
majority.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Whatever it takes?
o-o
Yeah, it seems
o-o
it'll take some
o-o
lookin' into
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm willing to
o-o
help you fight
o-o
against your fear
o-o
of math.
o-o
Let's do this!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm ready
o-o
to fight!
o-o
Let's find out
o-o
how to turn
o-o
the world
o-o
right side up.
o-o
I just hope there's
o-o
no evil fractions.
o-o
I'd rather
o-o
encounter
o-o
pirates or
o-o
snakes.
o-o
Or even a
o-o
volcano
o-o
ready to
o-o
erupt.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Rise up
o-o
dead spirits!
o-o
Help us
o-o
avenge

of the

end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What's nothing called
o-o
in math?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, zero.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah yes, wonderful
o-o
magical zero!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's so special
o-o
'bout zero?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Zero as a digit
o-o
was not known in
o-o
ancient Egypt,
o-o
Babylon, Greece,
o-o
and Rome.
o-o
But in ancient
o-o
China they put
o-o
their counting marks
o-o
inside a square.
o-o
So when no marks
o-o
are there,
o-o
it's an empty
o-o
square.
o-o
That changed to
o-o
a circle as
o-o
the idea spread
o-o
to India then
o-o
Arabic-speaking
o-o
universities.
o-o
And then a student
o-o
took it to Rome
o-o
and became pope.
o-o
combee ************
Pope Sylvestor II aka Gerbert of Aurillac brought decimal notation and calculation procedures to Europe, and he became pope in year 999.
************ comenn
He could
o-o
calculate
o-o
faster than the
o-o
Italians who
o-o
still used
o-o
counting marks,
o-o
the ones we call
o-o
Roman numerals.
o-o
That's how the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
became part
o-o
of the Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's when
o-o
Leonardo
o-o
painted the
o-o
Mona Lisa,
o-o
and Michelangelo
o-o
carved the
o-o
rock hyphen-here hard
o-o
anatomy of
o-o
David.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Lisa and David.
o-o
I think I've
o-o
heard about
o-o
those two.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With that
o-o
digit zero,
o-o
sailors made
o-o
realistic maps,
o-o
and navigated
o-o
far out into
o-o
the Atlantic.
o-o
That avoided
o-o
the north hyphen-here bound winds
o-o
that block the path
o-o
along the south coast
o-o
of Africa.
o-o
That path,
o-o
which bumped
o-o
into Brazil,
o-o
took them around
o-o
the southern tip
o-o
of Africa.
o-o
With that sea route
o-o
Europeans
o-o
bypassed the
o-o
monopoly that
o-o
Arabic-speaking
o-o
Muslims had
o-o
on the land hyphen-here based
o-o
silk road to China.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So it was
o-o
the digit zero,
o-o
not Columbus,
o-o
that got us
o-o
to North
o-o
and South
o-o
America?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes, in fact,
o-o
the Portuguese
o-o
discovered
o-o
Brazil before
o-o
fourteen ninety two.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so that's why
o-o
people in Brazil
o-o
speak Portuguese
o-o
instead of Spanish.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Interesting!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, zero's
o-o
a big hyphen-here deal number.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The digit zero.
o-o
Not just zero.
o-o
There have always
o-o
been words like
o-o
none, empty,
o-o
nobody,
o-o
ziltch, naked,
o-o
hungry, and
o-o
moron.
o-o
But writing
o-o
four zero zero
o-o
instead of
o-o
C C C C,
o-o
that's magic.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So the digit zero's
o-o
a big deal.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Without it
o-o
bridges would
o-o
be filled with
o-o
long lines of
o-o
accountants
o-o
...
o-o
waiting for
o-o
their turn to
o-o
jump off.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Without it,
o-o
scientists
o-o
and engineers
o-o
couldn't have put
o-o
a man on the moon,
o-o
or put rovers
o-o
on the
o-o
planet Mars,
o-o
or photographed
o-o
the rings of Saturn
o-o
from within
o-o
those rings.
o-o
And those are just
o-o
a few of the things
o-o
that make
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
so incredibly
o-o
fantastic.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think my
o-o
confusions
o-o
'bout zero
o-o
are gone.
o-o
But how's that
o-o
relate to
o-o
what happens
o-o
in gettin' fair
o-o
elections?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's something
o-o
in math that's
o-o
still very new.
o-o
It's not yet taught
o-o
in public schools.
o-o
Yet it can take
o-o
civilization,
o-o
humanity,
o-o
us,
o-o
to the next level
o-o
where elections
o-o
are fair.
o-o
But to get there
o-o
you need to
o-o
appreciate
o-o
the power of a
o-o
name.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, what's the name?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A name without
o-o
it's meaning is
o-o
useless.
o-o
Concepts come first.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Every test I took
o-o
cared more about
o-o
the names than the
o-o
concepts.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I learned to spell
o-o
begin-italics hypotenuse end-italics
o-o
before I learned
o-o
it had nothing
o-o
to do with
o-o
hippos.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's because names
o-o
and dates and such
o-o
are easier to test.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't that upside
o-o
down? Testin'
o-o
what's less
o-o
important?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You seem to me
o-o
to be quite
o-o
intelligent.
o-o
So let's
o-o
eliminate
o-o
your fear of
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there a
o-o
rattlesnake
o-o
cage or
o-o
fallin' tree
o-o
nearby?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
also disliked
o-o
fractions.
o-o
And so did
o-o
the Romans.
o-o
It's because
o-o
they lacked the
o-o
digit zero.
o-o
That's no big deal
o-o
for addition
o-o
and subtraction
o-o
and multiplication.
o-o
Those are just
o-o
shortcuts for
o-o
counting up,
o-o
counting down,
o-o
and a skipping
o-o
version of
o-o
counting up.
o-o
But division,
o-o
without the
o-o
big hyphen-here deal zero,
o-o
that's muddled and
o-o
befuddled
o-o
confusion.
o-o
So leaving
o-o
numbers as
o-o
fractions,
o-o
without doing the
o-o
division it
o-o
signifies,
o-o
that's what they did
o-o
until the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
arrived.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Now we've got
o-o
zero,
o-o
the digit.
o-o
Yet I've gotta
o-o
use fractions
o-o
every day.
o-o
It makes me
o-o
wacko to
o-o
add 'n subtract
o-o
those
o-o
...
o-o
suckers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If fractions you
o-o
loathe, then this
o-o
question I pose.
o-o
Why do you use them?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
It's part of
o-o
my job.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Are you a musician?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What's music
o-o
got to do with
o-o
fractions?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Musicians
o-o
cannot avoid
o-o
fractions.
o-o
They count
o-o
by two, or three,
o-o
or four, or six,
o-o
or eight.
o-o
But not by
o-o
five or ten.
o-o
Except,
o-o
I suspect,
o-o
for some
o-o

I build custom

o-o
Tape measures
o-o
are marked in
o-o
halves, quarters,
o-o
eighths, 'n
o-o
sixteenths.
o-o
Those effin'
o-o
fractions.
o-o
I'd murder
o-o
those suckers
o-o
if I knew
o-o
where to aim.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use decimal numbers.
o-o
That's what the whole
o-o
world uses, as part of
o-o
the metric system.
o-o
Except of course
o-o
here in the states.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I can't use
o-o
metric units.
o-o
That'd get
o-o
me fired.
o-o
Inches and feet
o-o
are required.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Decimal
o-o
numbers work
o-o
with inches too.
o-o
Just get a
o-o
tape measure with
o-o
decimal
o-o
markings for
o-o
inches!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, if only
o-o
I could do so.
o-o
That'd be great!
o-o
I could avoid
o-o
the fractions
o-o
I hate!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here, look at this
o-o
tape measure.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, it's marked
o-o
with ten units
o-o
per inch!
o-o
When I measure
o-o
I could write the
o-o
numbers as tenths
o-o
or hundredths.
o-o
'N it shows
o-o
eighths as well.
o-o
This is, well,
o-o
swell!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And adding and
o-o
subtracting them
o-o
is as easy as
o-o
dollars and cents.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So a fraction
o-o
is a
o-o
division
o-o
problem
o-o
unfinished.
o-o
It's waiting
o-o
to get
o-o
diminished
o-o
to a single
o-o
number.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Using this
o-o
tape measure
o-o
would be a
o-o
pleasure.
o-o
How do I get
o-o
one?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use the magic

Ah,

words can be

end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You learn fast!
o-o
Now about your
o-o
fear of
o-o
fractions.
o-o
Ancient Romans,
o-o
even though they
o-o
fearlessly
o-o
conquered most
o-o
Mediterranean
o-o
waterfront
o-o
property,
o-o
they too had
o-o
that fear.
o-o
They liked the
o-o
number twelve.
o-o
That's why sundials
o-o
have twelve marks
o-o
for the day.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So that's why we have
o-o
twenty four hours
o-o
per day?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
o-o
The number twelve
o-o
can be divided
o-o
by two and three
o-o
and four and six,
o-o
and yield a nice
o-o
result of
o-o
six or four or
o-o
three or two.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I wondered why
o-o
time is measured
o-o
in numbers that
o-o
aren't in
o-o
multiples
o-o
of ten.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sexagesimal.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
We're jumpin'
o-o
from fractions
o-o
to sex?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Using fractions
o-o
as foreplay
o-o
would solve
o-o
the world's
o-o
overpopulation
o-o
problem.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sexagesimal
o-o
is the name for
o-o
using sixty
o-o
as a base.
o-o
That's what the
o-o
ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
chose.
o-o
Sixty divides
o-o
without remainders
o-o
by two and three and
o-o
four and five and six
o-o
and ten and twelve
o-o
and fifteen and twenty
o-o
and thirty.
o-o
That's why an hour
o-o
has sixty minutes.
o-o
And why a minute
o-o
has sixty seconds.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So we could ditch
o-o
fractions?
o-o
That's a world
o-o
I'd like to see.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So are fractions
o-o
a bit less
o-o
scary?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
my fraction
o-o
phobia's
o-o
takin'
o-o
a siesta.
o-o
But sometimes
o-o
I get stuck
o-o
not knowing when
o-o
to do division,
o-o
in the right
o-o
sequence with
o-o
addition 'n
o-o
subtraction.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's just the trick
o-o
of algebra.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear lord
o-o
please forget
o-o
I said that!
o-o
From what I've heard,
o-o
algebra's
o-o
the fifth horseman
o-o
of the apocalypse.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Albert Einstein,
o-o
when he was young,
o-o
also had trouble
o-o
with algebra.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But he was a

genius.
o-o
And best known
o-o
for E equals
o-o
M C squared,
o-o
the ultimate
o-o
celebrity
o-o
math equation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He struggled
o-o
until his
o-o
uncle told him
o-o
to think of
o-o
algebra as
o-o
a whodunnit
o-o
mystery.
o-o
Where the
o-o
identity
o-o
of mister X
o-o
is unknown, and
o-o
the facts are clues,
o-o
and the goal is
o-o
to figure out
o-o
who is mister X?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Why didn't my
o-o
algebra teacher
o-o
teach that trick?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Because donning
o-o
a Sherlock Holmes
o-o
cap in class
o-o
would get you sent
o-o
to the principal's
o-o
office.
o-o
And writing
o-o
begin-italics whodunnit end-italics
o-o
on a
o-o
standardized
o-o
test would
o-o
get you sent to
o-o
the circus
o-o
as a clown.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, I think
o-o
I'm seein'
o-o
your point.
o-o
Division
o-o
asks the question:
o-o
begin-italics What number
o-o
needs to be
o-o
multiplied
o-o
times the number
o-o
on the bottom
o-o
of a fraction
o-o
to get the
o-o
number on the
o-o
top of the
o-o
fraction? end-italics
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes!
o-o
Excellent!
o-o
Now you
o-o
understand
o-o
some key ideas
o-o
of math.
o-o
Not enough
o-o
for me to
o-o
be inclined
o-o
to drive over
o-o
a bridge you
o-o
designed.
o-o
There's lots more.
o-o
And yet,
o-o
so much of it
o-o
would make sense
o-o
if math history
o-o
were taught
o-o
with a
o-o
focus on
o-o
concepts.
o-o
It even explains
o-o
why we say
o-o
fourteen and
o-o
thirteen but not
o-o
two hyphen-here teen
o-o
and one hyphen-here teen.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I suppose
o-o
this explains
o-o
why hotel
o-o
elevators
o-o
can't count to
o-o
thirteen.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I sure feel
o-o
unlucky
o-o
when I'm stuck with
o-o
a measurement
o-o
of thirteen
o-o
instead of
o-o
twelve 'n have to
o-o
divide it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here's another
o-o
useful secret.
o-o
Division is
o-o
disguised under
o-o
other names.
o-o
Like ratio,
o-o
rate,
o-o
proportion,
o-o
average,
o-o
percentage,
o-o
percent, and
o-o
the word per.
o-o
And of course
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So a fraction's
o-o
just a lazy
o-o
way to deal with
o-o
division?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've got it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
It sounds like we
o-o
need a revolution
o-o
in how math is taught.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Another revolution?
o-o
How many do you want?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
As many as it takes
o-o
to get things
o-o
right side up.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh I do wish
o-o
there was more time
o-o
so we could talk
o-o
about beautiful
o-o
balanced equations,
o-o
and what's behind
o-o
calculus, and
o-o
why quadratic equations
o-o
....
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Fortunately
o-o
we don't have
o-o
that much time.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course,
o-o
of course!
o-o
And anyway,
o-o
computers can do
o-o
math better than
o-o
students.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute!
o-o
Math textbooks
o-o
and math professors
o-o
are teaching us
o-o
thinking skills
o-o
that computers
o-o
can easily handle?
o-o
Why is that?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ironic isn't it?
o-o
Computers are better
o-o
than humans
o-o
at spelling,
o-o
grammar,
o-o
arithmetic,
o-o
algebra,
o-o
trigonometry,
o-o
calculus,
o-o
historical facts,
o-o
geography,
o-o
map reading, and
o-o
diplomatically
o-o
insulting you
o-o
for missing a
o-o
right turn.
o-o
Yet we try to teach
o-o
all that in school.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What're computers
o-o
not good at doing?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Inventing,
o-o
creating new
o-o
solutions to
o-o
real hyphen-here life
o-o
problems,
o-o
writing books
o-o
worth reading,
o-o
composing
o-o
beautiful music,
o-o
scripting videos
o-o
worth watching,
o-o
graphic design,
o-o
software development,
o-o
extracting meaning
o-o
from data,
o-o
creative things like that.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Would that include
o-o
designing
o-o
custom staircases?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Those are the skills
o-o
that employers
o-o
desire.
o-o
My boss says
o-o
it's hard to hire
o-o
workers who
o-o
can do much more
o-o
than loiter
o-o
in the general
o-o
vicinity
o-o
of a staircase.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So schools teach
o-o
what computers
o-o
can do better?
o-o
And schools fail
o-o
to teach the skills
o-o
that computers
o-o
are not good at,
o-o
but that
o-o
businesses
o-o
really want?
o-o
Wow!
o-o
The academic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
the
o-o
academic
o-o
world,
o-o
the one based on
o-o
standardized tests,
o-o
is upside down
o-o
for students
o-o
and teachers
o-o
and employers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
No wonder I often
o-o
recall so little
o-o
of what I learned
o-o
in college.
o-o
Computers
o-o
do it better.
o-o
We really ought
o-o
to have a
o-o
revolution
o-o
in how math,
o-o
and more,
o-o
is taught.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Computers
o-o
lack the ability
o-o
to understand
o-o
concepts.
o-o
Yet too often
o-o
that's what's
o-o
academia
o-o
fails to teach.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So schools
o-o
deserve a
o-o
failing grade!
o-o
I love it!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitions,
o-o
terminology,
o-o
memorization
o-o
of facts,
o-o
grammar rules,
o-o
math rules,
o-o
etcetera
o-o
are what professors
o-o
teach because
o-o
textbooks focus
o-o
on them.
o-o
And standardized
o-o
tests test
o-o
those things.
o-o
But really it's
o-o
the concepts
o-o
that schools
o-o
most need
o-o
to teach.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So schools are
o-o
trying to
o-o
begin-italics program end-italics students,
o-o
as if we were
o-o
computers.
o-o
While businesses
o-o
are trying to
o-o
begin-italics teach end-italics computers
o-o
how to think
o-o
like humans.
o-o
They're both
o-o
as stupid as
o-o
someone who brings
o-o
a kitchen knife
o-o
to a gun
o-o
battle.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a dead end.
o-o
Now can we switch
o-o
to politics
o-o
from just
o-o
mathematics?
o-o
I'm eager
o-o
to learn the
o-o
math behind
o-o
voting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you're ready.
o-o
You won't be scared
o-o
when zero
o-o
pops up.
o-o
And only one
o-o
very simple
o-o
fraction
o-o
is involved.
o-o
The one called
o-o
half.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Hurray!
o-o
Even a half wit
o-o
like me
o-o
can handle
o-o
a half.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's one
o-o
divided
o-o
by two.
o-o
That equals
o-o
zero point five.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or fifty
o-o
percent.
o-o
Now you're ready!
o-o
So let's explore
o-o
how votes need to
o-o
be counted for
o-o
results to be
o-o
fair.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So how do you think
o-o
voting should be done?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
As you know,
o-o
I'm not a
o-o
math wiz.
o-o
Or even a nerd.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
name-damien no-space ?
o-o
What do you
o-o
suppose
o-o
that would
o-o
look like?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Uh,
o-o
...
o-o
I reckon,
o-o
...
o-o
maybe
o-o
...
o-o
it might use
o-o
...
o-o
five stars?
o-o
...
o-o
Like
o-o
Amazon does?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a good start.
o-o
And why is that
o-o
approach smart?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If Amazon used
o-o
just one star
o-o
for each product,
o-o
like on an
o-o
'lection ballot,
o-o
that wouldn't be
o-o
enough info.
o-o
So what's needed
o-o
in elections
o-o
is more
o-o
info.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Yes indeed!
o-o
So if stars were
o-o
used in elections,
o-o
and the highest
o-o
count of stars
o-o
indicated
o-o
the winner,
o-o
how could you,
o-o
as a voter,
o-o
get some extra
o-o
influence?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm feelin'
o-o
like a dunce.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's try a
o-o
different
o-o
scenario.
o-o
Let's suppose
o-o
you're in the
o-o
audience at
o-o
a talent contest,
o-o
and the emcee
o-o
announces that
o-o
the loudness
o-o
of clapping
o-o
will determine
o-o
who wins.
o-o
How can you get
o-o
extra influence?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Nor do I.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You could clap
o-o
really loud for
o-o
your favorites,
o-o
and just pretend
o-o
to clap for the
o-o
others.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be
o-o
cheating.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a talent
o-o
contest, maybe,
o-o
maybe not.
o-o
At theater
o-o
events, that's
o-o
disrespectful.
o-o
But in an
o-o
election, with
o-o
money on the line,
o-o
that's just freedom
o-o
of expression.
o-o
It's voting,
o-o
but with an unfair
o-o
kind of vote
o-o
counting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, it's fighting!
o-o
Done on ballots.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So when I rate
o-o
things on Amazon
o-o
I should only
o-o
use one star
o-o
or five stars?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you do that
o-o
on Amazon
o-o
you're being a
o-o
jerk.
o-o
But if that star
o-o
rating were used
o-o
in elections,
o-o
where so much
o-o
is at stake,
o-o
that tactic
o-o
would make
o-o
your ballot
o-o
have more impact
o-o
than ballots
o-o
marked
o-o
honestly.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm still following
o-o
things to here.
o-o
Too bad I can't
o-o
celebrate with
o-o
a beer.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Bravo!
o-o
You see that
o-o
just collecting
o-o
more information
o-o
isn't enough.
o-o
How the information
o-o
is counted to
o-o
identify a
o-o
winner is so
o-o
important to
o-o
get right.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So the five star
o-o
method won't work?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, I should
o-o
take a step back.
o-o
There are two parts
o-o
to any voting method.
o-o
There's the ballot
o-o
and there's the
o-o
counting of those
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What kind'a ballot
o-o
do we use
o-o
now?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost
o-o
every nation in the
o-o
world uses what's
o-o
now called the
o-o
single hyphen-here mark ballot.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
'Cause we can
o-o
only mark a
o-o
single choice?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
o-o
And there's just
o-o
one way to count
o-o
that kind of ballot.
o-o
Which is why
o-o
until recently
o-o
that ballot didn't
o-o
have a name.
o-o
The counting method
o-o
has different names.
o-o
It's the enemy
o-o
of fair voting
o-o
so it's worth
o-o
learning its names.
o-o
In the academic
o-o
world it's called
o-o
begin-italics plurality voting end-italics no-space .
o-o
In Canada
o-o
and other
o-o
British places
o-o
it's called
o-o
begin-italics first past the post end-italics no-space .
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it called
o-o
here in the states?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's just called
o-o
voting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah! With no name
o-o
it becomes harder
o-o
to fight against!
o-o
Imagine protesting
o-o
with a sign that says
o-o
begin-italics End That Unnamed
o-o
Bad Kind Of
o-o
Vote Counting end-italics no-space .
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So that's the
o-o
enemy?
o-o
Plurality?
o-o
And it uses
o-o
the
o-o
single hyphen-here mark
o-o
ballot?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
It is to
o-o
democracy
o-o
what a string
o-o
and two old hyphen-here style
o-o
tin cans
o-o
are to the
o-o
telephone.
end-lyric

That's so

end-lyric

So what's the name
o-o
of a ballot where
o-o
each candidate
o-o
can be ranked at
o-o
a different level,
o-o
like on Amazon?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's called a
o-o
ranked ballot,
o-o
or a score ballot,
o-o
depending on
o-o
how it's counted.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain freeze
o-o
big time!
o-o
Is that difference
o-o
really of prime

importance?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To get the math
o-o
right, yes.
o-o
But both types
o-o
are better than
o-o
what we use now.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't anything
o-o
better than what
o-o
we use now?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost anything.
o-o
There's one
o-o
seductive
o-o
exception.
o-o
That's using points,
o-o
where each voter
o-o
is given a limited
o-o
number of points
o-o
to distribute
o-o
among the choices.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that because
o-o
a jerk could give
o-o
all his points
o-o
to a single
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's one
o-o
of its flaws.
o-o
If vote counting
o-o
methods
o-o
competed in
o-o
a limbo contest,
o-o
the points approach
o-o
would win
o-o
the limbo
o-o
contest,
o-o
as the
o-o
lowest.
o-o
Anything else
o-o
is like
o-o
pole vaulting
o-o
over what we

Paper ballots
o-o
with ovals to mark

work just fine.
o-o
Of course
o-o
columns of ovals
o-o
are needed for the

preference levels.
o-o
Let's say there's
o-o
seven columns.
o-o
The columns
o-o
would be labelled

begin-italics first choice end-italics no-space ,
o-o
begin-italics second choice end-italics no-space ,
o-o
begin-italics third choice end-italics no-space ,

marks more than

end-lyric

That candidate

that's the

You're sayin'
o-o
some ways

of counting
o-o
those ballots

end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly!
o-o
If everyone is
o-o
honest, then
o-o
simple counting
o-o
works fine.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Simple counting?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If there are five columns,
o-o
a marked oval
o-o
in the begin-italics first choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
five Amazon stars,
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics second choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
four Amazon stars,
o-o
and so on down to
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics fifth choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
one Amazon star.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's simple?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
A computer
o-o
would take care of doing
o-o
that counting.
o-o
You would just mark
o-o
the correct column
o-o
for each
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Even hand counting
o-o
the ballots
o-o
that way
o-o
would be easy.
o-o
For simple counting
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the highest
o-o
such count
o-o
would win.
o-o
If everyone
o-o
is honest,
o-o
then that
o-o
works fine.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Fat chance of that!
o-o
Honesty I mean.
o-o
It seems to be
o-o
getting less and less
o-o
fashionable.
o-o
Especially
o-o
in business
o-o
and politics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes when money
o-o
is involved,
o-o
as in politics,
o-o
then that simple
o-o
way of counting
o-o
ratings is
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to strategic
o-o
voters.
o-o
They can get
o-o
extra
o-o
influence
o-o
using the
o-o
clapping tactic.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm curious.
o-o
What happens
o-o
when Amazon
o-o
customers
o-o
realize they
o-o
can get extra
o-o
influence by
o-o
skipping the
o-o
middle ratings?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Then Amazon
o-o
can move the
o-o
goalposts.
o-o
They can count
o-o
differently.
o-o
Actually
o-o
they already do.
o-o
They can get even
o-o
more sophisticated
o-o
if that's needed.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm confused.
o-o
I understand
o-o
how the ballots work.
o-o
But I can't
o-o
imagine a

way to count votes
o-o
that's not like

any of what we've

You said the

o-o
has two names.
o-o
Which name applies
o-o
to the kind of
o-o
simple counting
o-o
we've been talking
o-o
about?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That kind of
o-o
ballot is asking
o-o
for a score
o-o
or a rating.
o-o
It's called
o-o
a score ballot.
o-o
It allows a voter
o-o
to indicate
o-o
how strongly the
o-o
voter feels about
o-o
who they like and
o-o
dislike.
o-o
Like the grades
o-o
A through F.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Most politicians

end-lyric

end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Before we

move on to what
o-o
I think is the
o-o
best kind of
o-o
vote counting,
o-o
here's an
o-o
interesting
o-o
simple kind of
o-o
improvement.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Consider the same
o-o
kind of ballot
o-o
we use now, the
o-o
single hyphen-here mark ballot.
o-o
But change the
o-o
instructions
o-o
and allow the voter
o-o
to mark more than
o-o
just one candidate.
o-o
That's called
o-o
approval
o-o
voting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, because you
o-o
either approve
o-o
each candidate or
o-o
leave their name
o-o
unmarked.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
This sounds like
o-o
Facebook,
o-o
where people can
o-o
upvote
o-o
anything and
o-o
everything.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're getting this!
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
On Reddit
o-o
we can upvote
o-o
and downvote.
o-o
That's more
o-o
info.
o-o
Is that
o-o
better?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only if it's
o-o
counted as
o-o
three ranking
o-o
levels.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Three?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember zero.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, an upvote
o-o
is like plus one.
o-o
And a downvote
o-o
is like minus one.
o-o
And neither
o-o
up nor down
o-o
is like zero.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If counted right
o-o
that could work.
o-o
But using
o-o
five levels
o-o
collects more
o-o
information
o-o
than three.
o-o
And when there are
o-o
lots and lots of candidates
o-o
then up to about twelve
o-o
levels would work.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But not
o-o
unlucky thirteen.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Since you
o-o
brought it up,
o-o
I'm guessing,
o-o
approval voting
o-o
might be fair?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It would work OK in
o-o
begin-italics
primary
end-italics
elections
o-o
because the winner
o-o
would always be from
o-o
the correct party.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But in general
o-o
elections,
o-o
the wrong party
o-o
must not win.
o-o
So there it
o-o
would cause
o-o
trouble,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
o-o
We need more
o-o
than just one
o-o
column of
o-o
ballot ovals
o-o
to avoid
o-o
criticism
o-o
of the results.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Wait a moment!
o-o
Just changing
o-o
written
o-o
directions
o-o
on the ballot
o-o
would be
o-o
an easy change
o-o
to make,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I'm not
o-o

You're finally

o-o
They look the same
o-o
as score ballots
o-o
with ovals,
o-o
but they're counted
o-o
differently.

o-o
that holds up
o-o
under
o-o

o-o
without
o-o
mutiny?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's harder than
o-o
any jigsaw

puzzle
o-o

o-o
without written
o-o

o-o
But take a guess.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Maybe
o-o
...
o-o
we could start
o-o
by looking at
o-o
...
o-o
just the top
o-o
part.
o-o
The top hyphen-here most
o-o

o-o
on each

o-o
...
end-lyric

Side step the fear

end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
And the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who gets the
o-o
fewest
o-o
top marks
o-o
...
o-o
gets
o-o
tossed aside?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Then the ballots
o-o
are modified
o-o
to hide the
o-o
one dismissed.
o-o
Then the process
o-o
repeats.
o-o
Until just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
remains?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That counting
o-o
method has
o-o
many
o-o
different names.
o-o
Here let's call it
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting.
o-o
Among friends,
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
More than half,
o-o
that's called a

majority.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If a
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a
o-o
majority,
o-o
then vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
o-o
That's so important
o-o
that Roberts
o-o

o-o

o-o
majority
o-o
support
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
How do those
o-o
rules say to
o-o
count votes?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Those rules don't say
o-o
how to get a
o-o
majority.
o-o
Just that it's
o-o
necessary.
o-o
They do say
o-o
to
begin-italics

o-o
there always

be a
o-o
majority?
o-o
Especially
o-o
when there are
o-o
more than two
o-o
candidates?
end-lyric

It's counting,

If it were
o-o
sports teams,
o-o
then,
o-o
...
o-o
well,
o-o
a team would be
o-o
the worst
o-o
loser if
o-o
it lost all
o-o
its pairwise
o-o
matches.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Keep going.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So the loser
o-o
of all the
o-o
pairwise contests
o-o
would get
o-o
eliminated.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'N then we'd
o-o
look for the
o-o
next loser,
o-o
from the remaining
o-o
teams, er,
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And when there's
o-o
just one team,
o-o
or candidate,
o-o
remaining, that
o-o
would be the
o-o
winner, right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
That pairwise
o-o
elimination
o-o
process would work,
o-o
up to a point.
o-o
A better shortcut
o-o
approach is to
o-o
look for the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who wins all
o-o
of their pairwise
o-o
contests.
o-o
The academic
o-o
world calls that a
o-o
Condorcet
begin-explain pronounced cone-dor-SAY end-explain
o-o
winner.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Condorcet,
o-o
that sounds stuffy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's named after
o-o
a French guy
o-o
whose title was the
o-o
Marques de
o-o
Condorcet.
o-o
For a long time
o-o
Europeans
o-o
thought he was the
o-o
first person to
o-o
publish a
o-o
description
o-o
of that method.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I can see,
o-o
as you say,
o-o
the concept
o-o
is the key.
o-o
Yet on a test,
o-o
students would be
o-o
asked to recall,
o-o
or recognize,
o-o
his name.
o-o
That's dumb.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see.
o-o
A Condorcet winner
o-o
would get more than
o-o
half the votes,
o-o
a majority,
o-o
without any
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
If this is
o-o
such a great
o-o
way to make
o-o
selections,
o-o
why isn't it used
o-o
for elections?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Because sometimes
o-o
there's no
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner.
o-o
Using the elimination
o-o
approach, it can
o-o
reach a point where
o-o
none of the candidates
o-o
loses all its
o-o
pairwise contests.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Partial losers.
o-o
But no total
o-o
losers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what?
o-o
Count how many
o-o
losses?
o-o
Or measure
o-o
how big the
o-o
losses are?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A plus
o-o
for thinking
o-o
of those
o-o
ideas!
o-o
Actually
o-o
there are many
o-o
ways to resolve
o-o
those cases.
o-o
Even better,
o-o
there are methods
o-o
that don't first
o-o
look for Condorcet
o-o
winners or losers.
o-o
Instead they use
o-o
the pairwise counts
o-o
in ways that
o-o
don't need to do
o-o
anything
o-o
special.
o-o
Yet they find the
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner when
o-o
one exists.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
magic.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's
o-o
beautiful
o-o
advanced
o-o
mathematics.
o-o
After all,
o-o
magic is a
o-o
word for what
o-o
we don't yet
o-o
fully
o-o
comprehend.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Like how
o-o
my landlord
o-o
calculates my
o-o
utility
o-o
bill.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Is there some
o-o
method you like,
o-o
that you could
o-o
explain,
o-o
in a way that
o-o
makes that magic
o-o
understandable?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
But before that
o-o
will make sense
o-o
I should ask you
o-o
how many pairwise
o-o
counts are involved
o-o
in each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess two.
o-o
If the two
o-o
candidates are
o-o
named Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
there's the count
o-o
for how many voters,
o-o
well, support,
o-o
uh, Pinoke
o-o
over Oscar.
o-o
And there's
o-o
the other count,
o-o
of how many voters
o-o
prefer Oscar
o-o
over Pinoke.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And will those two
o-o
numbers always
o-o
add up to the
o-o
total number
o-o
of voters?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think so.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but what if
o-o
some voters rank
o-o
Pinoke and Oscar
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, that means
o-o
there will be
o-o
a third number.
o-o
The number of voters
o-o
who rank them
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Yes there are
o-o
three numbers
o-o
for each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
o-o
But when summarized,
o-o
the third count
o-o
can be omitted.
o-o
This means the
o-o
pairwise numbers
o-o
can be put into
o-o
a table, a square grid.
o-o
And each row
o-o
would be labelled
o-o
with the name
o-o
of a candidate.
o-o
And the columns
o-o
would be labelled
o-o
with the same
o-o
names in the same
o-o
sequence.
o-o
And each cell
o-o
would contain
o-o
a count.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So if the
o-o
candidates
o-o
are named
o-o
Pinoke, Oscar,
o-o
Barack, and
o-o
Hypatia,
o-o
it would be
o-o
a four by four
o-o
grid, right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
o-o
Now you're ready
o-o
to see the magic
o-o
of the counting
o-o
method I like
o-o
best.
o-o
It re hyphen-here arranges
o-o
the sequence of
o-o
candidates,
o-o
in the rows
o-o
and columns.
o-o
The goal is to
o-o
re hyphen-here arrange
o-o
the sequence
o-o
until the biggest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
upper hyphen-here right
o-o
triangular area
o-o
of the grid,
o-o
and the smallest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
other half,
o-o
the lower hyphen-here left
o-o
triangular area.
o-o
Then we look at
o-o
that sequence.
o-o
It indicates
o-o
not only who is
o-o
most popular,
o-o
but who is second
o-o
most popular,
o-o
who is third most
o-o
popular, and
o-o
so on down to
o-o
who is least
o-o
popular.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that method
o-o
called?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The Condorcet
o-o
Kemeny
o-o
method.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'N is that the
o-o
fairest method?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
More research is
o-o
needed to
o-o
figure out which
o-o
method is best.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought math was
o-o
supposed to be
o-o
precise.
o-o
How can it be
o-o
indecisive
o-o
too?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe that's the
o-o
kind of math
o-o
your landlord
o-o
uses.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's a
o-o
mathematical
o-o
proof that proves
o-o
it's not possible
o-o
for there to be
o-o
a voting method
o-o
that has no flaws.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So math doesn't
o-o
have all the
o-o
answers?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's complicated.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Sounds like life and
o-o
relationships.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There are some
o-o
fairness
o-o
characteristics,
o-o
criteria,
o-o
that voting methods
o-o
pass or fail.
o-o
Math geeks know which
o-o
counting methods
o-o
can sometimes
o-o
fail which criteria.
o-o
But there has been
o-o
no research
o-o
to measure
o-o
how begin-italics often end-italics
o-o
each method fails,
o-o
or rather
o-o
passes,
o-o
each one.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Why hasn't that
o-o
research
o-o
been done?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Who would pay for
o-o
a search
o-o
to find the
o-o
best
o-o
replacement?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoever pays
o-o
for research
o-o
about
o-o
dinosaurs.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And
o-o
research in
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Most of that
o-o
funding comes from
o-o
the government.
o-o
Of course the
o-o
people who have
o-o
power
o-o
don't want to pay
o-o
for research
o-o
that reveals the
o-o
unfairness
o-o
that underpins
o-o
their power.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
A black widow
o-o
spider's web of
o-o
corruption!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think we've
o-o
learned what's
o-o
needed.
o-o
Ranked ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
counting.
o-o
So are we done?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's more.
o-o
So far we've
o-o
been talking
o-o
about how to
o-o
choose a
o-o
mayor,
o-o
governor,
o-o
or president
o-o
with fairness.
o-o
That's the first half.
o-o
But what happens
o-o
when there are
o-o
lots of seats
o-o
to fill,
o-o
like in
o-o
Congress?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain overload!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh right.
o-o
Instead, try this.
o-o
Imagine a
o-o
group of friends
o-o
choosing a
o-o
second
o-o
pizza
o-o
topping
o-o
for a pizza
o-o
they will share.
o-o
How would the
o-o
second topping
o-o
be chosen?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't the
o-o
second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate,
o-o
er, topping,
o-o
be elected,
o-o
er,
o-o
selected?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular has
o-o
more than one
o-o
meaning.
o-o
So let's try
o-o
yet another
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
five wolves and
o-o
four sheep vote
o-o
on what to eat
o-o
for dinner.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ha! The five wolves
o-o
would eat the
o-o
four sheep!
o-o
And claim it's fair
o-o
because it's
o-o
democracy!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So us
o-o
minorities,
o-o
like the sheep,
o-o
need a way to
o-o
fight against a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The Bill of Rights
o-o
is nice,
o-o
but that's
o-o
not enough
o-o
to protect us
o-o
minorities
o-o
from whites.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
As you see,
o-o
just getting a
o-o
majority
o-o
is not a
o-o
fully
o-o
zoomed out
o-o
view.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I see somethin'
o-o
else too.
o-o
If districts
o-o
were filled with
o-o
wolves 'n sheep,
o-o
'n each district
o-o
had slightly more
o-o
wolves than sheep,
o-o
then every
o-o
district would
o-o
elect a wolf.
o-o
Then congress would
o-o
be nothin' but wolves.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's not far from
o-o
what are now
o-o
mostly
o-o
white males.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In Europe,
o-o
instead of
o-o
wolves and sheep,
o-o
they have a
o-o
handful of
o-o
political parties.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Like wolves and sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sure.
o-o
On the ballot
o-o
each voter marks their
o-o
favorite
o-o
political party.
o-o
Let's say
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
mark their
o-o
ballot for
o-o
the Pirate
o-o
party.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'd join that one.
o-o
It sounds like
o-o
they're against
o-o
puppets.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Do they slash
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
with their
o-o
swords?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They don't carry
o-o
swords,
o-o
or dress like
o-o
pirates.
o-o
But they do
o-o
oppose
o-o
what they think is
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Go pirates!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In some
o-o
European
o-o
countries,
o-o
adjustments
o-o
are done to
o-o
ensure the
o-o
Pirate party,
o-o
and every
o-o
other party,
o-o
gets their fair share
o-o
of seats in
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that work?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It hides the
o-o
unfairness of
o-o
still using
o-o
single hyphen-here mark ballots.
o-o
Yet there are
o-o
lots of people
o-o
who like it.
o-o
That's because
o-o
they can point to
o-o
someone in
o-o
parliament
o-o
and claim their vote
o-o
helped elect
o-o
that MP,
o-o
er,
o-o
member of
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
From reading
o-o
news about
o-o
Europe those
o-o
governments
o-o
have as much
o-o
corruption
o-o
as us.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Back to
o-o
voting here
o-o
in the United States,
o-o
suppose each district
o-o
filled two seats
o-o
in the house of
o-o
representatives.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That means districts
o-o
would be twice the
o-o
size of existing
o-o
districts, right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Very good!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, half as many
o-o
districts,
o-o
and two seats
o-o
per district.
o-o
Sounds slick.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course the
o-o
most popular
o-o
candidate wins
o-o
the first seat.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So how's the
o-o
second seat filled?
o-o
In a way that's fair.
o-o
For the sheep,
o-o
and goats,
o-o
and pigs?
o-o
Or maybe I should say,
o-o
for women to get
o-o
the representation
o-o
we deserve.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Using simple math,
o-o
a computer can
o-o
calculate which
o-o
voters are 
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
by the first hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Since that math
o-o
is simple,
o-o
I don't need to
o-o
hear about it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
o-o
The ballots
o-o
of those
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
voters
o-o
would have their
o-o
influence
o-o
greatly reduced.
o-o
Often all the
o-o
way to zero.
o-o
The remaining
o-o
voters still have
o-o
full influence
o-o
for their ballots.
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
is done again,
o-o
and the most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
wins the
o-o
second seat.
o-o
In this
o-o
district.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm guessing the
o-o
effect would be
o-o
to elect one
o-o
Republican
o-o
and one
o-o
Democrat.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Typically yes,
o-o
assuming both
o-o
parties offer
o-o
good candidates.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That means
o-o
there would be
o-o
more than just
o-o
one
o-o
Republican
o-o
'n one
o-o
Democrat
o-o
in the race?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes because
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
o-o
So we need
o-o
to allow
o-o
for the
o-o
possibility
o-o
that one
o-o
of the
o-o
parties
o-o
only offers
o-o
disliked
o-o
candidates,
o-o
while the other
o-o
party offers
o-o
better
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, if, say,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party only
o-o
offered puppet
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Pinoke
o-o
'n Oscar,
o-o
'n the Democratic
o-o
party offered
o-o
anti hyphen-here corruption
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Barack
o-o
'n Hypatia,
o-o
then both winners
o-o
could be Democrats?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
This seems like a
o-o
winning
o-o
pole vault
o-o
over our low
o-o
limbo bar,
o-o
where we
o-o
are now.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But if every district
o-o
elects one
o-o
Republican and
o-o
one Democrat,
o-o
then Congress
o-o
would be tied.
o-o
That's cockeyed.
o-o
The population
o-o
is not
o-o
evenly
o-o
divided
o-o
between the
o-o
two parties.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To fix that
o-o
unfair balance,
o-o
we make the
o-o
districts a little
o-o
bigger. And we
o-o
reserve a few
o-o
extra seats.
o-o
Statewide seats.
o-o
Then we can do
o-o
the party hyphen-here based
o-o
adjustment to
o-o
figure out which
o-o
party deserves to win
o-o
each of those
o-o
statewide seats.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
And the party
o-o
leaders,
o-o
like the
o-o
insiders
o-o
in the Pirate
o-o
Party,
o-o
would get to
o-o
decide who should
o-o
fill those seats?
o-o
That seems
o-o
not right.
o-o
That would be
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Lots of
o-o
European
o-o
nations
o-o
do it that way.
o-o
Yet you're right.
o-o
It's not fair.
end-lyric

Why are those
o-o
voters so
o-o
stupid?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people
o-o
in power
o-o
are the ones who
o-o
have to approve
o-o
any change.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
o-o
The members of
o-o
parliament
o-o
only embrace
o-o
a change if it's
o-o
likely to get
o-o
themselves
o-o
re hyphen-here elected.
o-o
Otherwise it
o-o
would be as

unlikely as
o-o
turkeys voting

o-o
Thanksgiving.
end-lyric

Far fairer is

o-o
the most popular
o-o
of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
would fill that
o-o
party's
o-o
extra seat.
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each next seat.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That sounds like
o-o
it would rip
o-o
control away from
o-o
party insiders.
o-o
And empower
o-o
the voters.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much much
o-o
fairer than what
o-o
we've got now.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With no
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
elections
o-o
would no
o-o
longer be
o-o
limited
o-o
to just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
per party.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
no more blocking,
o-o
like how
o-o
Hillary
o-o
Clinton
o-o
got blocked
o-o
in two thousand eight.
o-o
Right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's right.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha
o-o
you're bright.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
It's just counting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And that's what the
o-o
important parts of
o-o
mathematics
o-o
are mostly about,
o-o
counting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So how can the
o-o
ballot handle
o-o
lots of candidates?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A separate
o-o
ballot question
o-o
can ask voters
o-o
to rank the
o-o
political parties.
o-o
That gives us the
o-o
info we need
o-o
to calculate
o-o
the popularity
o-o
of the
o-o
parties.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting for parties?
o-o
Is that really
o-o
a thing?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's what lots of
o-o
people in lots
o-o
of nations do
o-o
on their ballots.
o-o
Using that info,
o-o
the most popular
o-o
parties can be
o-o
allowed to have
o-o
two or three of
o-o
their candidates
o-o
in each race.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
And the least popular
o-o
parties get excluded?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That makes sense to me.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
And the biggest
o-o
third parties
o-o
get one candidate
o-o
each, right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That gives small
o-o
parties an
o-o
opportunity
o-o
to grow.
o-o
And even to
o-o
overtake
o-o
big parties.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't like names,
o-o
but this is
o-o
getting
o-o
complex.
o-o
Is there a name
o-o
for all of
o-o
this mess?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It is sort of like
o-o
a jigsaw puzzle
o-o
with lots of pieces,
o-o
and different
o-o
pieces would work,
o-o
and they have lots
o-o
of names.
o-o
But the only method
o-o
that does all of
o-o
what I've described
o-o
under a single
o-o
name is called
o-o
VoteFair Ranking.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
VoteFair?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
FairVote?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
VoteFair
o-o
is the ranking
o-o
method I like.
o-o
FairVote is an
o-o
organization
o-o
that promotes
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting and
o-o
something called
o-o
the single
o-o
transferable
o-o
vote.
o-o
They call those methods
o-o
begin-italics ranked choice end-italics
o-o
voting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's confusing.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes, intentionally.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, you like
o-o
VoteFair something.
o-o
Is there a
o-o
less hyphen-here specific
o-o
name?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
That's the most
o-o
important part.
o-o
Because pairwise counts
o-o
reveal not just support
o-o
but opposition.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's ranked
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
that you
o-o
recommend?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Plus adjustments
o-o
we've discussed that
o-o
give fuller
o-o
representation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
To the sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs
o-o
defending
o-o
themselves against
o-o
the wolves.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So how hard's it
o-o
to do pairwise
o-o
counting?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
All the counting
o-o
is done by computer,
o-o
so a tap on the screen
o-o
is all that's needed.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the
o-o
barrier against
o-o
using ranked
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Up until a few
o-o
decades ago, when
o-o
computers came along,
o-o
doing the math by hand
o-o
was the big barrier.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
But now we have
o-o
computers, so
o-o
what's stopping us
o-o
now?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fear.
o-o
Especially
o-o
a fear of math.
o-o
Officially
o-o
that's called
o-o
mathematical
o-o
anxiety.
o-o
Lots of people
o-o
have it 'cause
o-o
most people
o-o
don't trust what
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Math
o-o
anxiety.
o-o
That's what I
o-o
was infected
o-o
by.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
don't want
o-o
anyone
o-o
to cut the
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
they use to
o-o
control
o-o
politicians.
o-o
And their minions,
o-o
the insiders
o-o
within the two
o-o
political
o-o
parties,
o-o
don't want to
o-o
get fired.
o-o
Or lose their
o-o
perks.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Why isn't the
o-o
benefit
o-o
of greater
o-o
fairness
o-o
attracting
o-o
voters like a
o-o
magnet?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
You are so
o-o
na&#239;ve.
o-o
Greedy folks
o-o
are in control
o-o
and they don't want
o-o
fairness.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Those of us
o-o
who are
o-o
workin' hard
o-o
yet sufferin'
o-o
want our fair share
o-o
of the
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And rich people
o-o
want to protect
o-o
their too hyphen-here big slice
o-o
of economic pie,
o-o
probably with
o-o
vanilla
o-o
ice cream and
o-o
three cherries
o-o
on top.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Speaking of that,
o-o
here are colored blocks
o-o
that represent
o-o
nine ballots,
o-o
and the colors
o-o
represent
o-o
ice cream flavors.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Pretty colors!
o-o
Which flavors?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Dark brown is
o-o
chocolate.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Yum!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pink is for
o-o
strawberry.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not a fan
o-o
of pink.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This color represents
o-o
mint chocolate
o-o
chip.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And I presume
o-o
the last color
o-o
is vanilla.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But you haven't
o-o
explained why
o-o
you're pointing
o-o
out these
o-o
colored blocks.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With these
o-o
ballot preferences
o-o
the winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla,
o-o
depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so the counting
o-o
method does
o-o
matter!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
o-o
And yet,
o-o
almost any
o-o
method is better
o-o
than what we've
o-o
got now.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So now
o-o
do we know
o-o
all about voting?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's one
o-o
more bit.
o-o
But you can learn
o-o
about it
o-o
later,
o-o
when you're ready.
o-o
It will be
o-o
improvements
o-o
in how members
o-o
of Congress
o-o
vote to decide
o-o
which bills
o-o
should pass
o-o
to become
o-o
laws.
o-o
But getting
o-o
that math right
o-o
is too advanced
o-o
for you now.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If elections were fair,
o-o
what would change,
o-o
politically?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
especially
o-o
for the
o-o
unfortunate
o-o
poor.
o-o
And us college
o-o
grads who failed
o-o
to get to
o-o
the middle
o-o
class.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The answer to that
o-o
I don't know.
o-o
For that you need
o-o
to ask someone
o-o
who understands both
o-o
economics and
o-o
game theory.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Game theory?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
o-o
Voting's a game!
o-o
That makes sense.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's an academic field
o-o
that studies, well,
o-o
it's difficult to
o-o
describe.
o-o
But it includes
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
I do know someone
o-o
with those credentials.
o-o
But he's at a
o-o
university
o-o
that's a three hyphen-here hour
o-o
drive away.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Do you think he'd
o-o
give us a peek
o-o
into that
o-o
future?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I can ask him
o-o
by email.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be super!
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He studies,
o-o
and teaches about,
o-o
economic history.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The history
o-o
of economics?
o-o
That sounds like
o-o
a waste.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a different
o-o
field,
o-o
and yes that would
o-o
be boring
o-o
for the two of you.
o-o
What he teaches
o-o
is economic
o-o
history.
o-o
That's the study
o-o
of economies
o-o
during earlier
o-o
times.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I hate
o-o
history.
o-o
As much as
o-o
I did
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This professor
o-o
can make
o-o
history fun.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Can that be done?
o-o
'N economics,
o-o
that's more math.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You did great with
o-o
history in
o-o
mathematics.
o-o
As for math in
o-o
economics,
o-o
it's just different
o-o
names for money.
o-o
Like tax, debt,
o-o
interest,
o-o
tariffs, and
o-o
bribes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm a dummy
o-o
but I'll
o-o
try.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
One more tip.
o-o
There's something
o-o
called begin-italics mathiness end-italics no-space .
o-o
It's a misuse of
o-o
mathematics.
o-o
Math doesn't lie,
o-o
but some liars
o-o
use numbers
o-o
when they lie.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Mathiness
o-o
must be what
o-o
my landlord's
o-o
usin'
o-o
on me.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I admit I tend
o-o
to distrust math
o-o
until I do the
o-o
counting or
o-o
calculations
o-o
myself.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So, we've
o-o
learned that
o-o
ranked ballots
o-o
and
o-o
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
is the key
o-o
to less corruption
o-o
in Washington
o-o
DC.
o-o
But do we need
o-o
to remember
o-o
that guy's name?
o-o
Condolences,
o-o
or something?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
includes
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
methods,
o-o
and some
o-o
non hyphen-here Condorcet
o-o
methods.
o-o
So just remember
o-o
the concept of
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
And needing more
o-o
than half those votes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Half's a fraction
o-o
I can recall.
o-o
But I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
why you made a
o-o
big deal out of
o-o
the digit
o-o
zero.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It took our
o-o
ancestors
o-o
hundreds of years
o-o
to make the leap
o-o
from the number
o-o
zero
o-o
to the digit
o-o
zero.
o-o
To us,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
that's slow.
o-o
In a similar way
o-o
folks in the
o-o
distant future
o-o
will marvel that
o-o
it took so long
o-o
for us to use
o-o
pairwise counting
o-o
for counting votes.
o-o
Zero as a digit
o-o
changed the world
o-o
in marvellous ways.
o-o
Similarly
o-o
pairwise vote counting
o-o
will change the world
o-o
in marvellous ways.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So just like we
o-o
don't know what
o-o
we've got til
o-o
it's gone,
o-o
we don't really
o-o
know what's missing
o-o
until it can be
o-o
seen in
o-o
hindsight?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I was right.
o-o
You
begin-italics are end-italics
very bright.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a wise
o-o
insight.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's just
o-o
common sense.
o-o
But what you've
o-o
taught us
o-o
are hidden

secrets.
o-o

o-o
We're grateful
o-o
you've guided

o-o
We'll share
o-o
what we've
o-o
learned.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember your

o-o
...
o-o
that you won't
o-o
reveal where
o-o
they came from.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, but why?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I've got tenure,
o-o
so I'm not likely
o-o
to lose my job.
o-o
But I can
o-o
lose grants for
o-o
my research projects.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, 'n some of your
o-o
funds come from the

end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes. Lots.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
When we bite the hand
o-o
that feeds you
o-o
we won't reveal
o-o
who took us off
o-o
our leashes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
We can say we
o-o
learned it from
o-o
Wikipedia.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only bits of it
o-o
are in Wikipedia.
o-o
That's because
o-o
they require
o-o
academic
o-o
references,
o-o
especially
o-o
for
o-o
mathematical
o-o
topics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And I suppose
o-o
those references
o-o
don't exist because
o-o
governments
o-o
don't fund such
o-o
research.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
This is all seeming
o-o
like a giant
o-o
conspiracy,
o-o
except that it's
o-o
in plain view.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
It's hidden
o-o
behind the
o-o
curtain of
o-o
mathematics,
o-o
under the
o-o
unmarked
o-o
trap door
o-o
of pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Fear of math
o-o
keeps it well hidden.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
This makes it
o-o
all the more special
o-o
that you've taken
o-o
the time to explain
o-o
this to us.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm extremely
o-o
grateful.
o-o
You've given me,
o-o
us, more than I
o-o
could ever have
o-o
hoped for.
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I love these kinds
o-o
of conversations.
o-o
I wish textbooks
o-o
and those dang
o-o
standardized
o-o
tests would allow
o-o
me to teach more
o-o
like this,
o-o
without as much
o-o
notation
o-o
and terminology.
o-o
The joy of math
o-o
is in the concepts.
o-o
That's what counts.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I'm
o-o
beginning to see
o-o
a begin-italics fraction end-italics of
o-o
that joy in
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, one more thing.
o-o
Since pairwise counting
o-o
is a few years off,
o-o
what can we do
o-o
in the next
o-o
election
o-o
to fight against
o-o
vote splitting?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Tell your friends,
o-o
including the
o-o
ones online,
o-o
that the
o-o
single hyphen-here mark
o-o
ballot,
o-o
what we use now,
o-o
is not asking
o-o
begin-italics who is your favorite? end-italics
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what's it
o-o
asking?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Besides
o-o
which loser
o-o
do you want
o-o
to get stuck
o-o
with?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There is no
o-o
easy way
o-o
to say
o-o
what it's
o-o
asking.
o-o
And there's no way
o-o
to mark a
o-o
single hyphen-here mark
o-o
ballot to say
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
o-o
And choosing
o-o
not to vote
o-o
does not express
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
o-o
Instead a
o-o
voter needs to
o-o
hold their nose
o-o
and mark a
o-o
candidate
o-o
who has a chance
o-o
of winning.
o-o
Otherwise
o-o
they weaken
o-o
the candidate
o-o
they prefer
o-o
who does have
o-o
a chance of
o-o
winning.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But that means
o-o
never voting
o-o
for a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
No.
o-o
You can vote for
o-o
a third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate
o-o
if the
o-o
candidate
o-o
you most despise
o-o
will easily
o-o
win.
o-o
That means
o-o
none of the
o-o
opposition
o-o
candidates
o-o
has a chance
o-o
of winning,
o-o
so then it
o-o
makes sense
o-o
to mark your
o-o
favorite
o-o
opposition
o-o
candidate,
o-o
which can be
o-o
from a third
o-o
party.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So if Trump
o-o
would easily
o-o
get re hyphen-here elected

That's an

important
o-o
exception
o-o
because in a
o-o
presidential
o-o
election
o-o
the popular
o-o
vote still
o-o
matters.
o-o
Specifically
o-o
the gap between

the

Republican
o-o
and the

Democrat
o-o
is put under

I thought
o-o
presidential

end-lyric
ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The way to
o-o
help defeat

vote splitting
o-o
is to vote in
o-o
begin-italics both end-italics
primary

begin-italics and end-italics

And especially
o-o

Promote the

o-o
Professor,
o-o
do you have a

general notion
o-o
'bout what will
o-o
change?
o-o
Especially
o-o
in Washington.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course!
o-o
Lots of new laws
o-o
will be
o-o
passed.
o-o
Then a few
o-o
people who
o-o
greatly profit
o-o
from existing
o-o
conditions will
o-o
earn less money,
o-o
and almost everyone
o-o
else will enjoy
o-o
increased prosperity.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What's your
o-o
justification?
o-o
For that prediction?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That trend has been
o-o
going on throughout
o-o
civilization
o-o
and history.
o-o
Not counting
o-o
setbacks
o-o
caused by
o-o
warfare.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Can you
o-o
explain why?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Imagine the economy
o-o
as a strawberry pie.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not fond of
o-o
strawberry pie.
o-o
Can we call it
o-o
a cherry pie?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course. Now
o-o
imagine the economy
o-o
is a cherry pie.
o-o
If some people
o-o
cut themselves
o-o
a slice that is
o-o
too big, then other
o-o
people end up with
o-o
smaller slices.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm following this.
o-o
Wow!
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
What would you like
o-o
to call the people
o-o
who take too big
o-o
of a slice?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
People in the
o-o
political down.
o-o
As opposed to the
o-o
political left
o-o
'n political
o-o
right.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
'N the people
o-o
who get too little
o-o
would be people
o-o
in the political
o-o
up.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Bravo!
o-o
I'll bet you
o-o
had to struggle
o-o
to get your
o-o
bearings
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
jungle.
o-o
So,
o-o
the way I see it,
o-o
if elections
o-o
were fair,
o-o
then elected
o-o
leaders
o-o
would care
o-o
more about
o-o
the people
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up,
o-o
where most
o-o
of us are,
o-o
get too little
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the part
o-o
we've figured
o-o
out.
o-o
And the fact that
o-o
the replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
wouldn't lie
o-o
...
o-o
as much.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Those replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
would pass laws
o-o
that give bigger
o-o
slices of
o-o
economic
o-o
pie
o-o
to the
o-o
majority
o-o
of voters.

bits of

Oh dear,
o-o
not silly
o-o
wonky
o-o
history.
o-o
I learned some.
o-o
But I'm done
o-o
with the past.
o-o
It's gone.
o-o
Why do people
o-o
dwell on that
o-o
old stuffy
o-o

o-o
Other than

using it

o-o
The future
o-o
is behind me
o-o
where I
o-o
cannot see.
o-o
So I look
o-o
where I've been.
o-o
That's the past.
o-o
The patterns
o-o
give me clues
o-o
about
o-o
that which is
o-o
yet to be.
o-o
So history
o-o
is like a
o-o
crystal ball.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I see!
o-o
History
o-o
is a preview
o-o
of the future.
o-o
Who knew?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Many people
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
focus on
o-o
history
o-o
as recalling
o-o
facts about
o-o
the past.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
In a history
o-o

o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would beat me

Wikipedia
o-o

cryin'
o-o

o-o
so much.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
You said that
o-o
reading glasses
o-o
with a blue tint
o-o
helps with books.
o-o
A good browser
o-o
can change
o-o
Wikipedia's
o-o
white background
o-o
to blue.
o-o
See how that looks.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll give that
o-o
trick a try.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Rather than facts,
o-o
what's more useful
o-o
regarding
o-o
history
o-o
is causation.
o-o
Cause and effect.
o-o
Especially
o-o
when it involves
o-o
a surprise.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Can ya translate
o-o
that into a
o-o
for instance?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
If that's
o-o
what it takes,
o-o
here's one that
o-o
involves snakes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The political kind?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Cobras.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I like them,
o-o
at a distance.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A city in
o-o
India
o-o
had a problem
o-o
with too many
o-o
cobra snakes.
o-o
So they put
o-o
a bounty
o-o
on the snakes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize bounty
o-o
as another word
o-o
for money.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the cause.
o-o
So what would you
o-o
expect
o-o
to be the
o-o
effect?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Fewer cobra snakes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
You mentioned
o-o
surprises.
o-o
So I'll guess the
o-o
number of snakes
o-o
increased.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed, the cobra
o-o
population increased.
o-o
So the test question
o-o
is: why?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I hate tests.
o-o
They are
o-o
rodent pests
o-o
that scare my wits
o-o
into a
o-o
dark corner.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Flunk!
o-o
With your brain,
o-o
try to maintain
o-o
your focus on
o-o
the topic,
o-o
the subject,
o-o
the concept.
o-o
Don't try to push
o-o
away the fear.
o-o
Figure out why
o-o
you still cling
o-o
to the fear.
o-o
Then just let go
o-o
of the fear.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Got it.
o-o
I'll let go of
o-o
the scare.
o-o
I'll focus on
o-o
the snake.
o-o
There's less fear there.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So why did the
o-o
cobra population
o-o
increase?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
When money gets
o-o
offered for something
o-o
then people do
o-o
what it takes to
o-o
get that money.
o-o
Enterprising city
o-o
residents went into
o-o
the cobra snake
o-o
breeding business.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess that
o-o
after realizing
o-o
what was going on,
o-o
the bounty was ended
o-o
and those extra
o-o
snakes got released?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus!
o-o
That's what happened.
o-o
This historical
o-o
event reminds
o-o
us to consider
o-o
otherwise
o-o
unexpected
o-o
consequences.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
There are lots of
o-o
awful unfair
o-o
consequences
o-o
of Congress and
o-o
its corruption,
o-o
but those shouldn't
o-o
be unexpected.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's look
o-o
at one of the
o-o
problems that
o-o
economists face.
o-o
You've heard of
o-o
the gross domestic
o-o
product,
o-o
the GDP?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah, it measures,
o-o
well, when it goes
o-o
up, that's good.
o-o
'N when it goes
o-o
down, that's bad.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
So here's the next
o-o
test question.
o-o
Does the GDP
o-o
go up or down
o-o
when a family's
o-o
house burns down?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
This seems like
o-o
another trick
o-o
question so I'll
o-o
say GDP
o-o
goes up.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
C plus.
o-o
For an A you need
o-o
to tell me why.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Because building the
o-o
replacement house,
o-o
or more likely the
o-o
selling of the property
o-o
to a developer who
o-o
builds a condominium,
o-o
is business activity,
o-o
and that's what GDP
o-o
measures.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
Yes, GDP just
o-o
measures transfers
o-o
of money.
o-o
When nothing is
o-o
bought or sold
o-o
there's no change
o-o
in gross domestic
o-o
product.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That is gross.
o-o
But what's this
o-o
got to do with
o-o
election
o-o
vote hyphen-here counting
o-o
reform?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
When people are
o-o
optimistic about
o-o
the future,
o-o
GDP goes up
o-o
because people
o-o
buy more products,
o-o
pay for more
o-o
services,
o-o
eat out, and
o-o
make babies.
o-o
But when people
o-o
are pessimistic
o-o
about the future,
o-o
they fearfully cling
o-o
to their money,
o-o
so there are
o-o
fewer transfers
o-o
of money.
o-o
And when
o-o
they postpone
o-o
making babies,
o-o
there are fewer
o-o
future
o-o
customers.
o-o
All that pulls
o-o
down GDP.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
N' you think
o-o
people will become
o-o
optimistic when
o-o
fairer voting
o-o
methods are
o-o
adopted?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
The short answer
o-o
is yes.
o-o
The fuller answer
o-o
involves what's
o-o
happening now in
o-o
the economy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I keep hearing
o-o
the economy's
o-o
on the climbing
o-o
path of a
o-o
roller coaster.
o-o
But I'm in
o-o
one of the cars
o-o
that's derailed,
o-o
and I'm
o-o
plunging
o-o
fast.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
The stock market
o-o
keeps going up and up
o-o
because people
o-o
with money have
o-o
few other places
o-o
to invest it.
o-o
Specifically
o-o
certificates
o-o
of deposit
o-o
don't yield much
o-o
interest.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
o-o
That gives the stock
o-o
market sort of a
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So stocks are
o-o
like an
o-o
over-inflated
o-o
balloon.
o-o
Does that mean our
o-o
roller coaster
o-o
ride will soon
o-o
plummet?
o-o
And the poor
o-o
will all die?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's difficult
o-o
to predict when
o-o
it will drop
o-o
from its
o-o
recent
o-o
top.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
You said
o-o
economists
o-o
predict the future.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Knowing begin-italics what end-italics will
o-o
happen is
o-o
different
o-o
from knowing begin-italics when end-italics
o-o
those whats will
o-o
happen.
o-o
Professors
o-o
of economics
o-o
focus on
o-o
rational
o-o
behavior.
o-o
But successful
o-o
investors earn
o-o
lots of money
o-o
by knowing the
o-o
stock market
o-o
can stay
o-o
irrational
o-o
longer than
o-o
investors
o-o
can stay
o-o
solvent.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
o-o
Economists
o-o
assume people
o-o
are smart.
o-o
This explains why
o-o
they,
o-o
and you,
o-o
aren't wealthy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Our math proofs
o-o
do have
o-o
some goofs.
o-o
After all,
o-o
measuring
o-o
stupidity
o-o
is tricky.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of
o-o
morons,
o-o
why doesn't
o-o
the economy
o-o
work for
o-o
hard workers
o-o
like me?
o-o
The numbers lie.
o-o
They say
o-o
everything's
o-o
hunky dory.
o-o
Is this an example
o-o
of mathiness?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
I don't know what
o-o
mathiness is.
o-o
But numbers can
o-o
be deceptive.
o-o
What many people
o-o
overlook is that
o-o
the unemployment
o-o
rate that's in the news
o-o
just counts people
o-o
who are now getting
o-o
unemployment
o-o
benefits.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Those benefits
o-o
run out after a
o-o
few months of having
o-o
no job. I've learned
o-o
that from
o-o
experience.
o-o
So unemployment
o-o
is actually higher,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, it's higher.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Why don't economists
o-o
measure that?
o-o
The real unemployment
o-o

end-lyric

The government
o-o
does measure that
o-o
as well.
o-o
But most
o-o
newspapers and
o-o
TV stations
o-o
report the
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate
o-o
that
o-o
government
o-o
officials call
o-o
attention to.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Since wealthy
o-o
business owners
o-o
own news sources,
o-o
they probably
o-o
tell their
o-o
reporters
o-o
to report the
o-o
lower rate.
o-o
That gives
o-o
consumers
o-o
the confidence
o-o
to spend dollars
o-o
more freely.
o-o
And that gives
o-o
the wealthy
o-o
more sales,
o-o
more money.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought it was
o-o
just the
o-o
government
o-o
being sneaky.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's both.
o-o
The government
o-o
knows that if they
o-o
call attention
o-o
to the higher
o-o
unemployment rate,
o-o
then some of the
o-o
optimism
o-o
disappears.
o-o
Then the economy
o-o
and the GDP
o-o
would trend
o-o
downward.
o-o
And that would
o-o
activate a
o-o
bad feedback loop.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's a

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Get your head
o-o
out of that
o-o
gloomy
o-o
pot smoker's
o-o
toilet.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A feedback loop.
o-o
When you're in
o-o
an auditorium
o-o
and the sound
o-o
system squeals,
o-o
that's a
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh yeah.
o-o
That's when
o-o
...
o-o
a tiny sound
o-o
at the microphone
o-o
...
o-o
gets amplified
o-o
...
o-o
'n comes out the

speakers
o-o
...
o-o
'n gets
o-o
back to the
o-o
microphone
o-o
...
o-o
just slightly
o-o
louder than
o-o
before.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It becomes
o-o
as loud as possible
o-o
as fast as
o-o
possible.
o-o
And a feeback loop
o-o
is what makes a
o-o
hurricane
o-o
so powerful.
o-o
There are lots of
o-o
feedback loops.
o-o
That's what's
o-o
behind
o-o
economic
o-o
inflation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
A strong wind?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
When an employee
o-o
who makes plush
o-o
toy dinosaurs
o-o
gets a salary
o-o
increase,
o-o
the business
o-o
has to increase
o-o
the price of
o-o
their dinos.
o-o
A mother working
o-o
in a grocery store
o-o
then gets a raise
o-o
to afford rising
o-o
toy prices.
o-o
Then the
o-o
grocery store
o-o
slightly raises
o-o
its prices
o-o
to cover that
o-o
cost increase.
o-o
Then that feeds back
o-o
to the original
o-o
employee who
o-o
shops at that
o-o
grocery store.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's inflation,
o-o
when salaries
o-o
and prices
o-o
increase
o-o
together.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That feedback loop
o-o
has to be slowed down
o-o
by doing something
o-o
that decouples
o-o
at least one
o-o
of the links
o-o
in the loop.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So announcing
o-o
a higher rate of
o-o
unemployment
o-o
would undermine
o-o
optimism.
o-o
And that would
o-o
bring down
o-o
the economy.
o-o
And that would
o-o
cause more
o-o
layoffs.
o-o
And that would
o-o
speed up
o-o
how fast the
o-o
economy
o-o
goes down.
o-o
This makes sense.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Governments
o-o
try to make the
o-o
economy
o-o
grow fast.
o-o
And yet also
o-o
keep inflation
o-o
slow.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the concept.
o-o
Of course
o-o
my students
o-o
have to say it
o-o
with the right
o-o
terminology.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Otherwise they'd
o-o
get bad grades
o-o
on standardized
o-o
tests, right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes.
o-o
I have to teach
o-o
to the tests.
o-o
Yet the important
o-o
parts of economics
o-o
are the concepts,
o-o
and that's why it's
o-o
a delight to get
o-o
to explain them
o-o
to you two.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha no-space ,

I'm thinkin'
o-o
here the

concept is
o-o
...
o-o
your poop
o-o
scooper loop's
o-o
a feedback
o-o
loop?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's different.
o-o
Dog owners
o-o
have to care
o-o
about the health
o-o
of other dogs
o-o
to protect
o-o
their own dog's
o-o
health.
o-o
Here, in
o-o
economic
o-o
kinds of
o-o
feedback loops,
o-o
begin-italics self hyphen-here interest end-italics
o-o
is the
o-o
motivation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, the
o-o
employees
o-o
ask for a

higher salary
o-o
for selfish
o-o
reasons.
o-o
'N the business
o-o
owners sell
o-o
at higher
o-o
prices
o-o
for selfish
o-o
reasons.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Right.
o-o
In economic
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
the changes
o-o
happen because
o-o
each person
o-o
focuses on
o-o
what they
o-o
themselves
o-o
want.
o-o
Without caring
o-o
about what
o-o
others want.
o-o
Like with those
o-o
cobra snake
o-o
breeders.
o-o
They didn't
o-o
much care
o-o
how many
o-o
cobra snakes
o-o
are in the
o-o
city.
o-o
Their actions
o-o
were just based on
o-o
monetary
o-o
self hyphen-here interest.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
o-o
Dog owners,
o-o
the pooper
o-o
scooper ones,
o-o
care how many
o-o
piles of dog poop
o-o
their dog
o-o
can sniff.
o-o
But that's
o-o
affected by
o-o
other dog
o-o
owners.
o-o
There's no
o-o
benefit
o-o
to poop
o-o
scooping
o-o
if other
o-o
dog owners
o-o
don't scoop
o-o
too.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
You've got it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey!
o-o
...
o-o
Wait a moment.
o-o
...
o-o
Feedback loops
o-o
are what rich
o-o
business owners
o-o
use to get
o-o
oversized slices
o-o
of economic pie!
o-o
They use lawyers.
o-o
And they control
o-o
news sources.
o-o
And they control
o-o
politicians.
o-o
They use
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to give themselves
o-o
bigger
o-o
and bigger
o-o
slices of
o-o
cherry pie.
o-o
No wonder
o-o
I'm hungry,
o-o
economically.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Yet why
o-o
does it seem
o-o
that rent
o-o
'n food
o-o
'n ice cream
o-o
are going up
o-o
and up fast
o-o
while salaries
o-o
stay stuck?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not your
o-o
imagination.
o-o
The cost of living
o-o
is going up
o-o
faster than
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
which is the
o-o
official
o-o
measurement
o-o
of inflation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's another
o-o
corrupt
o-o
measurement.
o-o
The consumer
o-o
price index.
o-o
But I forgot
o-o
why it's corrupt.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
You didn't forget.
o-o
We can't teach why
o-o
to undergrads.
o-o
Part of the why
o-o
is because
o-o
back when the price
o-o
of food items
o-o
were quickly
o-o
rising,
o-o
some food items
o-o
were replaced by
o-o
items whose cost
o-o
were declining.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's declining
o-o
in cost?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
The per hyphen-here pixel cost
o-o
of digital
o-o
cameras.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize
o-o
that word begin-italics per end-italics no-space .
o-o
It means division.
o-o
And the number
o-o
of pixels in
o-o
a camera
o-o
are going up,
o-o
so dividing by
o-o
that bigger number
o-o
makes the result
o-o
go down.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So that's another way
o-o
the government
o-o
is hiding the real
o-o
cost of living.
o-o
I can guess why
o-o
they're not being
o-o
transparent.
o-o
But something else
o-o
is going on, right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Some government
o-o
expenses
o-o
are matched to the
o-o
consumer price
o-o
index.
o-o
Such as
o-o
retirement
o-o
pensions for
o-o
government
o-o
employees,
o-o
and social
o-o
security
o-o
benefits.
o-o
And that index's
o-o
linked to the
o-o
interest
o-o
they pay for
o-o
borrowed
o-o
money.
o-o
So the
o-o
government
o-o
wants inflation
o-o
to stay low.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So the government
o-o
saves lots of money
o-o
by pretending
o-o
inflation
o-o
is low,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
And as another
o-o
trick they
o-o
get to exclude
o-o
rent and fuel,
o-o
which are rising
o-o
quickly.
o-o
They're
o-o
excluded
o-o
from that index
o-o
because they're
o-o
too volatile.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That means they
o-o
go up and down
o-o
like a nervous
o-o
kangaroo rat.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Is anything else
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Besides hot

end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
do you
o-o
remember from
o-o
econ one oh one
o-o
what determines
o-o
interest rates?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The federal
o-o
reserve chooses
o-o
when to increase
o-o
and decrease the
o-o
interest rate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the rate
o-o
talked about
o-o
in the news,
o-o
but more important
o-o
is the rate
o-o
determined by
o-o
auctioning
o-o
treasuries.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I don't remember
o-o
learning about
o-o
those actions,
o-o
I mean,
o-o
auctions.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not taught to
o-o
undergrads.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll bet textbooks
o-o
don't include it
o-o
because schools
o-o
are funded by
o-o
the government.
o-o
So textbooks can't
o-o
reveal secrets
o-o
the government
o-o
wants to hide.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, that's another
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
All these feedback
o-o
loops!
o-o
They make math seem
o-o
simple.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I agree.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
U.S. treasuries
o-o
are sold in
o-o
auctions.
o-o
In economically
o-o
optimistic
o-o
times those
o-o
treasuries
o-o
sell for
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
closer to the
o-o
amount the
o-o
government pays
o-o
when they reach their
o-o
redemption date.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but in
o-o
economically
o-o
pessimistic
o-o
times the buyers
o-o
pay much less.
o-o
That increases
o-o
the gap between
o-o
purchase price
o-o
and redemption
o-o
payment. So that
o-o
brings up rates
o-o
of interest,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, I think I'm
o-o
following.
o-o
Since interest
o-o
rates are low,
o-o
that means there's
o-o
lots of buyers
o-o
for those
o-o
...
o-o
things?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Treasuries.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
Yes, normally.
o-o
But China and
o-o
Russia stopped
o-o
buying them so
o-o
lately the
o-o
federal reserve
o-o
has been buying
o-o
lots of them.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That would be like
o-o
the plush toy
o-o
dinosaur
o-o
business
o-o
buying its own
o-o
dinos to give
o-o
the appearance
o-o
of extra customers
o-o
and income.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's partly
o-o
why the deficit
o-o
is so huge.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so the U.S.
o-o
government has
o-o
increased its debt
o-o
to compensate
o-o
for rough times
o-o
economically?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a moment.
o-o
Our economy's
o-o
like a stack of
o-o
wood blocks in a
o-o
teetering tower
o-o
that's ready to
o-o
fall?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Almost all
o-o
nations and all
o-o
big businesses
o-o
are in debt.
o-o
So are farmers.
o-o
They all have to
o-o
borrow first
o-o
before they can
o-o
grow crops or
o-o
manufacture
o-o
or whatever to
o-o
get income.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So being in debt
o-o
is not a big deal,
o-o
but a growing
o-o
deficit, that's
o-o
bad, right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Relatively
o-o
speaking, yes.
o-o
But as long as
o-o
the government
o-o
is keeping its
o-o
citizens happy,
o-o
and happier than
o-o
in other nations,
o-o
problems can be
o-o
hidden behind
o-o
curtains of
o-o
distraction.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The number of
o-o
people trying
o-o
to immigrate
o-o
into the U.S.
o-o
is still high,
o-o
right?
o-o
So that
o-o
suggests
o-o
success.
o-o
Yet things
o-o
are a mess.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So what should be
o-o
going on instead?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
History tells us
o-o
that prosperity
o-o
happens when a
o-o
city, nation,
o-o
or region
o-o
sells something
o-o
that people outside
o-o
the region
o-o
either need or
o-o
strongly desire.
o-o
And it's not
o-o
available from
o-o
anywhere else.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
because,
o-o
well,
o-o
it helps.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Do you know what
o-o
the silk road was?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
Marco Polo
o-o
and lots of
o-o
caravans
o-o
traveled along
o-o
it to get silk
o-o
from China.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
China was getting
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
things flowing
o-o
into their country
o-o
to pay for the silk.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So that made
o-o
China rich?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
China wisely
o-o
kept their special
o-o
silkworms within
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City to
o-o
protect their
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
Protecting a
o-o
monopoly
o-o
through secrecy
o-o
is an important
o-o
way for a
o-o
region or a
o-o
business to
o-o
dramatically
o-o
gain economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The Forbidden
o-o
City's the fortress
o-o
where the emperor
o-o
of China
o-o
lived.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Be the
o-o
only source
o-o
of something
o-o
valuable.
o-o
That's a
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
Hmm,
o-o
this seems
o-o
familiar.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Another way
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity
o-o
is to increase
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
How come
o-o
prosperity
o-o
increases
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
No,
o-o
you've got it
o-o
backwards
o-o
in your head.
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
increases
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
again.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Consider the
o-o
Roman empire.
o-o
They wrote laws
o-o
to control
o-o
business and
o-o
commerce,
o-o
including setting
o-o
standards for
o-o
weights and sizes.
o-o
And they used
o-o
soldiers and
o-o
courts to
o-o
enforce those laws.
o-o
And they built roads
o-o
and patroled them
o-o
with soldiers.
o-o
They built aqueducts
o-o
to channel water
o-o
to cities.
o-o
All of that
o-o
greatly increased
o-o
the efficiency
o-o
of their economy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
o-o
Economic
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Economic
o-o
efficiency
o-o
means something
o-o
different.
o-o
Here I'm talking
o-o
about efficiency
o-o
as a general
o-o
concept,
o-o
where profits
o-o
go up
o-o
when costs
o-o
go down.
o-o
Costs went down
o-o
when those
o-o
Romans wasted
o-o
less time
o-o
fetching water,
o-o
getting sick
o-o
because of not
o-o
having water
o-o
to wash
o-o
their hands,
o-o
breaking
o-o
ox hyphen-here cart wheels
o-o
on bad roads,
o-o
getting cheated
o-o
by merchants
o-o
who used short
o-o
yardsticks,
o-o
and getting robbed
o-o
by bad
o-o
Samaritans.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Less time wasted.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Especially
o-o
important
o-o
is for there
o-o
to be less
o-o
fighting.
o-o
Not only
o-o
physical
o-o
fighting,
o-o
but fewer
o-o
business disputes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Since efficiency
o-o
is so important,
o-o
economists
o-o
measure it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
They think they do.
o-o
They have
o-o
something called
o-o
economic
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
but that's more like
o-o
the gain and loss
o-o
of a cherry pie.
o-o
And they have
o-o
something called the
o-o
productivity
o-o
index.
o-o
But it's flawed.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
You do remember
o-o
some economics.
o-o
The productivity
o-o
index
o-o
is supposed to
o-o
measure
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which is similar
o-o
to efficiency.
o-o
Yet that index
o-o
increases
o-o
when a house
o-o
burns down
o-o
and then
o-o
inexpensively
o-o
gets rebuilt.
o-o
Of course it
o-o
would be even
o-o
more efficient
o-o
if the house
o-o
never burned down.
o-o
But measuring
o-o
non hyphen-here destruction,
o-o
alas that's not
o-o
a sexy topic
o-o
that attracts
o-o
economists'
o-o
attention.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And it fails
o-o
to account for
o-o
the benefits
o-o
of some kinds
o-o
of socialism,
o-o
like public
o-o
libraries,
o-o
and better
o-o
public
o-o
education.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So if efficiency
o-o
is what made the
o-o
Roman empire
o-o
great,
o-o
why did it
o-o
decline?
o-o
In just a
o-o
sentence or two.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
If all the books
o-o
on this subject
o-o
fell on you,
o-o
you'd get buried
o-o
in an avalanche
o-o
ten feet high.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'll give you just
o-o
the relevant part.
o-o
After the years of
o-o
good governance
o-o
and
o-o
prosperity,
o-o
corruption grew.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Why?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
This is going
o-o
to take awhile.
o-o
What I'm wearing
o-o
might go
o-o
out of style.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Actually
o-o
it's simple.
o-o
You know what the
o-o
free market is,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
In an ideal free market,
o-o
there are no barriers.
o-o
People can choose
o-o
what to buy,
o-o
what to sell,
o-o
how much to charge,
o-o
and whatever else,
o-o
without fighting.
o-o
That's a fluid,
o-o
flexible,
o-o
and efficient,
o-o
economy.
o-o
But corruption?
o-o
That puts up barriers
o-o
that are chosen
o-o
to channel money
o-o
into specific pockets.
o-o
Those corrupt
o-o
barriers
o-o
reduce
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I've
o-o
got it.
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
and selling what's
o-o
desirable is
o-o
what brings money
o-o
into a region.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which causes
o-o
economic
o-o
decline.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
In ancient Rome
o-o
a bigger source
o-o
of wealth was
o-o
through conquest.
o-o
That means stealing.
o-o
That's what brought
o-o
lots of
o-o
valuable
o-o
stuff into Rome,
o-o
from other
o-o
regions.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
But that ends
o-o
when there's
o-o
no more regions
o-o
to conquer
o-o
and plunder,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Basically
o-o
that's the kids' book
o-o
version of the
o-o
Roman empire.
o-o
A similar kind of
o-o
rise and fall
o-o
pattern happened
o-o
later with the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
o-o
It started with
o-o
efficient banking.
o-o
Plus improved ships
o-o
using technology
o-o
from China.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The compass, right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the ship's
o-o
rudder.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
And the digit zero.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
You're astute!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
No my ass
o-o
didn't toot!
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Astute.
o-o
It means your brain
o-o
just did the
o-o
equivalent of
o-o
a gymnastics
o-o
triple twist
o-o
vault
o-o
with a perfect
o-o
landing.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh thanks!
o-o
And gunpowder
o-o
too?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Certainly
o-o
gunpowder
o-o
enabled seagoing
o-o
people to exploit
o-o
other regions
o-o
and their resources.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Now that I
o-o
recognize
o-o
that using
o-o
big tall ships
o-o
to transport
o-o
silk and
o-o
other stuff
o-o
between
o-o
Asia and
o-o
Europe
o-o
...
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
The other stuff
o-o
included
o-o
gold, salt,
o-o
ivory,
o-o
frankincense,
o-o
toga fabric,
o-o
and their
o-o
equivalent
o-o
of Reeses
o-o
peanut butter
o-o
cups.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
...
o-o
I realize that
o-o
running into
o-o
America and
o-o
taking land from
o-o
the natives,
o-o
and enslaving
o-o
Africans to work
o-o
on plantations
o-o
in the Caribbean,
o-o
was an
o-o
economic
o-o
bonus.
o-o
And giving
o-o
religious folks
o-o
a place where they
o-o
could escape
o-o
competing
o-o
religions
o-o
was just, for us,
o-o
a lucky byproduct?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Basically, yes.
o-o
And it gave
o-o
democracy
o-o
a place to grow,
o-o
far away from
o-o
big armies
o-o
and navies.
o-o
The resulting
o-o
cooperation
o-o
among U.S. states
o-o
led to immense
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
It was so much
o-o
more efficient
o-o
than
o-o
hereditary
o-o
court appointments,
o-o
political
o-o
patronage,
o-o
guilds,
o-o
secret
o-o
societies,
o-o
and fraternal
o-o
organizations
o-o
that even then
o-o
did teamwork
o-o
building
o-o
through
o-o
drinking binges.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Corruption!
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
those barbaric
o-o
traditions
o-o
can be seen as
o-o
corrupt.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
And inefficient,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Very much so.
o-o
That's why
o-o
a couple
o-o
centuries later
o-o
Europeans
o-o
formed the
o-o
European
o-o
Union.
o-o
They abandoned
o-o
fighting between
o-o
Catholics and
o-o
Protestants.
o-o
They abandoned
o-o
fighting over
o-o
language
o-o
differences.
o-o
And they stopped
o-o
having food fights
o-o
about table
o-o
etiquette.
o-o
Instead they are
o-o
copying
o-o
the clear
o-o
success of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
that works so well
o-o
in the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
You said fighting
o-o
undermines the
o-o
economy.
o-o
Yet political hawks,
o-o
who are mostly
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
promote warfare
o-o
as a way to
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
And competition
o-o
between
o-o
nations,
o-o
and between
o-o
businesses,
o-o
is the basis
o-o
of prosperity
o-o
in a free market,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm lost.
o-o
I feel like I'm
o-o
in a maze and
o-o
someone turned off
o-o
the lights.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Competition
o-o
between
o-o
businesses
o-o
provides
o-o
motivation
o-o
to work hard.
o-o
But what gets
o-o
overlooked is
o-o
the teamwork,
o-o
the
o-o
cooperation,
o-o
between
o-o
employees.
o-o
And the
o-o
cooperation
o-o
between
o-o
citizens
o-o
within the same
o-o
nation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Hmm.
o-o
So teamwork
o-o
is more than
o-o
touchy hyphen-here feely
o-o
games?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, employees
o-o
getting along,
o-o
who wouldn't
o-o
normally get along.
o-o
Like employees
o-o
ignoring
o-o
racial differences,
o-o
religious
o-o
differences,
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, and Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
ignoring their
o-o
differences
o-o
while at work.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
When these
o-o
conflicts
o-o
are ignored,
o-o
that's cooperation.
o-o
Ah, that increases
o-o
efficiency
o-o
begin-italics within end-italics the business.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So cooperation
o-o
within a business
o-o
makes the business
o-o
strong,
o-o
so it can better
o-o
compete against
o-o
other
o-o
businesses?
o-o
The lights are
o-o
coming back on.
o-o
I think I see.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So fighting
o-o
between groups
o-o
of people
o-o
inspires,
o-o
motivates,
o-o
cooperation
o-o
within each
o-o
group?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not a bad
o-o
simplification.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So a free market
o-o
is a good thing?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A fully free
o-o
market is
o-o
impossible,
o-o
yet it gets tried
o-o
repeatedly,
o-o
and it fails.
o-o
Like the
o-o
Articles of
o-o
Confederation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's that?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Basically the U.S.
o-o
Constitution
o-o
is version two point oh.
o-o
The Articles of
o-o
Confederation
o-o
was version one point oh.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It failed
o-o
partly because
o-o
it asked each
o-o
colony to supply
o-o
soldiers and
o-o
weapons and such,
o-o
but there was no
o-o
negative
o-o
consequence
o-o
for the colonies
o-o
that didn't.
o-o
So the
o-o
Constitution,
o-o
among other
o-o
changes,
o-o
taxed the
o-o
colonies
o-o
to pay for one
o-o
big army
o-o
and navy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
And air force?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Wake up!
o-o
Time travel
o-o
hadn't been
o-o
invented yet.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That cooperation,
o-o
among the
o-o
colonies,
o-o
was the opposite
o-o
of what
o-o
European
o-o
nations were doing,
o-o
which was fighting
o-o
each other
o-o
endlessly.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that if there was
o-o
a fully free
o-o
market then we
o-o
wouldn't have things
o-o
like a military?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Or public schools,
o-o
food for the poor,
o-o
hospitals, or
o-o
orphanages
o-o
for little
o-o
orphan
o-o
Annies.
o-o
Those things
o-o
were created
o-o
by churches,
o-o
and promoted by
o-o
religions.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Religion?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Ancient priests
o-o
in Egypt earned
o-o
their grain and beer
o-o
by predicting
o-o
eclipses
o-o
so their boss,
o-o
the pharaoh,
o-o
could pretend
o-o
to be powerful.
o-o
And they
o-o
predicted
o-o
when the Nile
o-o
River would
o-o
flood and recede.
o-o
Plus each year
o-o
priests used
o-o
mathematics
o-o
and surveying
o-o
to lay out the
o-o
new farming
o-o
boundaries.
o-o
All of that was
o-o
like magic
o-o
to people who
o-o
didn't understand
o-o
astronomy,
o-o
weather, and
o-o
geometry.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Galileo
o-o
was a threat to the
o-o
Catholic Church.
o-o
He showed that
o-o
science
o-o
was better than
o-o
priests
o-o
at those
o-o
brainy
o-o
skills.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
And priests lost
o-o
lots of
o-o
credibility,
o-o
plus their lives,
o-o
during the
o-o
European
o-o
black death
o-o
by praying
o-o
for the dying.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And by failing
o-o
to cure the sick.
o-o
They prescribed
o-o
holy water,
o-o
prayers, and
o-o
a pilgrimage
o-o
to kneel before
o-o
the pelvic
o-o
girdle
o-o
of Saint Bernard
o-o
of Piddlesbourough.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Those priests
o-o
would have flunked
o-o
out of
o-o
medical
o-o
school.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of what
o-o
was once done by
o-o
religion
o-o
has split into
o-o
science,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
public
o-o
education,
o-o
and
o-o
government.
o-o
Now,
o-o
as I see it,
o-o
the big barrier
o-o
against progress
o-o
for civilization
o-o
is our use of
o-o
very primitive
o-o
voting methods.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So what would
o-o
happen if we,
o-o
the majority
o-o
of voters,
o-o
could elect
o-o
leaders who care?
o-o
How would those
o-o
leaders
o-o
change the U.S.
o-o
economy?
o-o
To make it fair.
o-o
I assume they would
o-o
increase our
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes they would
o-o
want to increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
As a start,
o-o
they would avoid
o-o
making big mistakes
o-o
other nations
o-o
have made.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Stupidity
o-o
at the national
o-o
level.
o-o
I don't feel
o-o
so alone.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
When England
o-o
was prosperous
o-o
they raised tariffs
o-o
as a way to increase
o-o
their income,
o-o
or so they thought.
o-o
But
o-o
higher tariffs,
o-o
just like
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
only work if
o-o
there's a
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
That new barrier
o-o
gave Dutch people
o-o
a trading advantage,
o-o
because they had
o-o
lower tariffs.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So higher tariffs
o-o
on English goods
o-o
motivated
o-o
other nations
o-o
to trade with the Dutch
o-o
instead of the
o-o
English?
o-o
Isn't that when
o-o
Dutch business
o-o
owners grew so
o-o
wealthy they bid up
o-o
the price of
o-o
tulip bulbs to
o-o
sub hyphen-here orbital
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And isn't that when
o-o
the Pilgrims
o-o
moved to Holland,
o-o
where the Dutch live,
o-o
so they could
o-o
escape religious
o-o
persecution
o-o
from the state hyphen-here run
o-o
church in
o-o
England?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Right.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If free
o-o
markets are great,
o-o
why don't we
o-o
have more of that?
o-o
'N fewer
o-o
monopolies?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Great question.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A free market
o-o
saves money for
o-o
lots of people.
o-o
But it decreases
o-o
income for
o-o
people who cling
o-o
to outdated ways
o-o
of doing business.
o-o
So naturally
o-o
wealthy business
o-o
owners pay
o-o
politicians
o-o
to keep the
o-o
status quo.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Status quo ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Means keepin' things
o-o
as they are.
o-o
I've been doing
o-o
some cramming.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
On the flip side,
o-o
a free market
o-o
increases wealth

innovate

Lots of knowledge
o-o
and lots of skills
o-o
died with them.
o-o
What a waste.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
And that caused a
o-o
bad feedback loop.
o-o
It reduced the
o-o
people who could
o-o
educate the next
o-o
generation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so that's why
o-o
men in college
o-o
get excluded
o-o
when there's a
o-o
military
o-o
draft.
o-o
I see.
o-o
Knowledge and skills
o-o
are also resources
o-o
that can get
o-o
used wisely,
o-o
or wasted.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Or lost.
o-o
During the
o-o
European
o-o
black death,
o-o
lots of blacksmiths
o-o
and ship builders
o-o
and court jesters
o-o
died.
o-o
With them died
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
knowledge.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Jesters
o-o
knew how to
o-o
juggle
o-o
pig bladders
o-o
and chew berries
o-o
at the same time?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back before
o-o
Netflix and
o-o
the iPod
o-o
and radio,
o-o
even before
o-o
record players,
o-o
music and jokes
o-o
and dances
o-o
could only be
o-o
heard or seen in
o-o
the presence of
o-o
musicians,
o-o
storytellers,
o-o
dancers, and
o-o
jesters.
o-o
If they died
o-o
without passing
o-o
along what
o-o
they knew,
o-o
their
o-o
melodious songs,
o-o
spellbinding
o-o
stories,
o-o
tantalizing
o-o
dances,
o-o
and hilarious
o-o
jokes
o-o
got lost.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, death.
o-o
It takes so much away.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
In those times
o-o
horseshoes,
o-o
swords, and
o-o
sailing ships
o-o
were high
o-o
technology.
o-o
That's why blacksmiths
o-o
and ship builders
o-o
were so
o-o
valuable.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Is this
o-o
related
o-o
to why humans
o-o
haven't
o-o
recently
o-o
walked on the moon?
o-o
Losing knowledge?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes.
o-o
The people
o-o
who knew how to
o-o
put them there
o-o
are dead,
o-o
or retired.
o-o
And some written
o-o
knowledge on
o-o
computer
o-o
hard drives
o-o
was erased.
o-o
On the bright side,
o-o
the opposite
o-o
of losing
o-o
knowledge
o-o
is gaining
o-o
knowledge.
o-o
That's what gave
o-o
strength to the
o-o
Islamic
o-o
Golden Age.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's that?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's when Bagdad
o-o
was the center
o-o
of an empire
o-o
of people who
o-o
spoke Arabic
o-o
and followed
o-o
the religion
o-o
of Islam.
o-o
A wise ruler,
o-o
whose name I don't
o-o
remember ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
...
o-o
Harun al hyphen-here Rashid,
o-o
at the end of
o-o
the seven hundreds ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
...
o-o
collected books
o-o
and gathered
o-o
wise scholars
o-o
from around the world,
o-o
and paid smart people
o-o
to develop things
o-o
like algebra,
o-o
geometry,
o-o
and ...,
o-o
I forget what else.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Medicine,
o-o
three D drawings,
o-o
robotic mechanisms,
o-o
papermaking,
o-o
and much more.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that when
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
made its way
o-o
closer to Europe?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes, and why
o-o
Europeans
o-o
and we refer
o-o
to the digits
o-o
zero through nine
o-o
as Arabic
o-o
numerals.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus plus.
o-o
And that empire
o-o
became weak
o-o
as a result
o-o
of what?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Corruption
o-o
I'll bet.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, including
o-o
a dismissal
o-o
of science.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
People who
o-o
dismiss science
o-o
are doubly stupid.
o-o
And I'll bet
o-o
some of them
o-o
are capitalists
o-o
who fail to see
o-o
that the loss of
o-o
science leads the
o-o
economy
o-o
into a death
o-o
spiral.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Another bad
o-o
feedback loop.
o-o
Got it.
o-o
About
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
how come it
o-o
so often wins
o-o
against
o-o
knowledge?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Dictators
o-o
and wannabe
o-o
dictators
o-o
outlaw or
o-o
monopolize
o-o
knowledge.
o-o
When Mao Zedong
o-o
led China
o-o
he destroyed books
o-o
and banished
o-o
intellectuals
o-o
to manual hyphen-here labor
o-o
jobs.
o-o
That undermined
o-o
the economy.
o-o
After Mao died
o-o
the brightest
o-o
compliant ones
o-o
were allowed back
o-o
into science and
o-o
business,
o-o
and that shift
o-o
paid off.
o-o
But it didn't
o-o
restore all of
o-o
what was lost.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Since
o-o
Europeans
o-o
got lots of
o-o
inventions
o-o
from China,
o-o
did earlier
o-o
Chinese rulers
o-o
do better?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Chinese emperors
o-o
feared losing
o-o
what they called
o-o
the mandate
o-o
of heaven.
o-o
What we call
o-o
the right to rule.
o-o
Especially
o-o
they feared
o-o
natural
o-o
disasters.
o-o
That's because
o-o
too many deaths
o-o
caused by flood,
o-o
or pandemic,
o-o
or crop failure,
o-o
would lead to
o-o
rebellion and
o-o
revolution.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
Congress lost
o-o
the mandate
o-o
of heaven
o-o
long ago.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
To prevent
o-o
catastrophes
o-o
Chinese leaders
o-o
hired and
o-o
promoted
o-o
based on
o-o
competence
o-o
instead of
o-o
nepotism
o-o
and favoritism.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What's nepo...
o-o
whatever.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Hiring family members.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't that a
o-o
no hyphen-here brainer?
o-o
Hiring based on
o-o
skills and
o-o
a good
o-o
word-resume no-space ?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Alas,
o-o
hiring
o-o
relatives
o-o
and friends
o-o
channels wealth
o-o
selfishly
o-o
for short hyphen-here term gains.
o-o
Instead of
o-o
wisely
o-o
for long hyphen-here term
o-o
gains.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Another
o-o
big loss of
o-o
efficiency is
o-o
mismanagement.
o-o
That's partly why
o-o
NASA lost
o-o
its ability
o-o
to make rockets
o-o
that can take
o-o
astronauts
o-o
to the space station.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And why now
o-o
NASA has to buy
o-o
passage for
o-o
astronauts on
o-o
Russian rockets.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
On the topic
o-o
of Russia,
o-o
socialism
o-o
is what some folks
o-o
think would be
o-o
better than
o-o
capitalism,
o-o
but it's not.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I learned that once.
o-o
But when I try
o-o
to remember why,
o-o
what comes up
o-o
is something
o-o
about
o-o
chocolate.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's because
o-o
free markets
o-o
more quickly
o-o
arrive at the
o-o
most efficient
o-o
networks and
o-o
interdependencies.
o-o
In contrast,
o-o
socialism
o-o
attempts to
o-o
control
o-o
markets
o-o
from the top down,
o-o
using quotas,
o-o
and penalties,
o-o
and fixing
o-o
prices,
o-o
such as the price
o-o
of sugar and
o-o
chocolate.
o-o
But those rules
o-o
can't change as fast
o-o
as what happens
o-o
at the bottom
o-o
of the economy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I wanna see
o-o
if I'm
o-o
understanding.
o-o
...
o-o
A free and
o-o
efficient
o-o
market's like
o-o
letting water
o-o
find its own way
o-o
to the ocean?
o-o
Instead of
o-o
trying to
o-o
redirect
o-o
rivers.
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a useful
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
And now,
o-o
finally,
o-o
you're ready to
o-o
understand
o-o
something
o-o
important
o-o
that doesn't have
o-o
a name.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Bring it on!
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's a very
o-o
effective
o-o
way for a
o-o
government
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
The first half
o-o
is to begin-italics decrease
o-o
taxes end-italics on
o-o
begin-italics business end-italics
o-o
activities
o-o
that are efficient
o-o
and bring a net flow
o-o
of money into
o-o
the region.
o-o
The second half
o-o
is to begin-italics increase
o-o
taxes end-italics on
o-o
begin-italics business end-italics
o-o
activities
o-o
that are
o-o
inefficient,
o-o
wasteful, or
o-o
plunder
o-o
the locals
o-o
in the style of
o-o
New Jersey
o-o
lawyers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So,
o-o
besides lawyers,
o-o
which
o-o
business
o-o
activities
o-o
are which?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's consider
o-o
some different
o-o
kinds of businesses.
o-o
How about farming?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That brings money in.
o-o
If the crops are sold
o-o
outside the U.S.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Which is part of
o-o
why farmers get
o-o
lots of special
o-o
government
o-o
subsidies.
o-o
How about manufacturing?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That brings money in,
o-o
when the products 
o-o
are sold outside
o-o
the U.S.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought that
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses
o-o
were bad.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when the
o-o
industrial
o-o
revolution
o-o
began,
o-o
that was common.
o-o
Owners used
o-o
greedy shortcuts.
o-o
And still
o-o
there are some
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses
o-o
that treat laws
o-o
as if they're
o-o
optional
o-o
suggested
o-o
guidelines.
o-o
But today's
o-o
transgressions
o-o
are mild compared
o-o
to earlier times.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
A
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
business
o-o
doesn't need to be
o-o
bad.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
If there were
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
for good
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses,
o-o
that would reward
o-o
them for
o-o
efficiently
o-o
hiring skilled
o-o
workers who
o-o
transform raw
o-o
materials
o-o
into valuable
o-o
products worth
o-o
lots of money.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So software
o-o
businesses
o-o
would get lower
o-o
taxes too?
o-o
They bring lots of money
o-o
into the United States
o-o
from other nations,
o-o
and they just consume
o-o
electricity.
o-o
And they hire highly
o-o
skilled software
o-o
developers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great example.
o-o
How about mining
o-o
companies?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They bring lots of
o-o
money into the U.S.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But the U.S.
o-o
loses lots of
o-o
natural
o-o
resources
o-o
that future
o-o
generations
o-o
will come to miss,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Like Japan,
o-o
where they cut down
o-o
their forests for
o-o
firewood.
o-o
Now they buy
o-o
lots of timber
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
Or did back when
o-o
massive logging
o-o
was done in the
o-o
Pacific
o-o
Northwest.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So mining and
o-o
timber businesses
o-o
deserve to pay
o-o
higher taxes,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics deserve end-italics
o-o
is judgemental,
o-o
so that's a matter
o-o
of opinion.
o-o
There might be times
o-o
when name-desha thinks
o-o
you deserve to be
o-o
spanked with a
o-o
wet towel,
o-o
but that would be
o-o
a judgement,
o-o
not a fact.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
In this case
o-o
it's a fact.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
But, yes, if
o-o
mining and timber
o-o
industries export
o-o
lots of materials
o-o
now, then future
o-o
generations
o-o
will not have those
o-o
resources to
o-o
use, sell,
o-o
or waste.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Short hyphen-here sighted capitalists.
o-o
Speaking of that,
o-o
what's capitalism?
o-o
It's confusing to me.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's because
o-o
the word really
o-o
has different
o-o
meanings
o-o
in different
o-o
situations.
o-o
Of course textbooks
o-o
carefully
o-o
define it,
o-o
but those
o-o
definitions
o-o
use words that
o-o
don't fully capture
o-o
exactly
o-o
what it means
o-o
every time
o-o
it's used.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Which explains why
o-o
so much of what I
o-o
learned in school
o-o
now seems like snow
o-o
on a sunny
o-o
hillside.
o-o
It's long gone.
o-o
But this,
o-o
what you're
o-o
teaching us,
o-o
reveals
o-o
so many
o-o
secrets
o-o
that lie beneath
o-o
puzzling
o-o
mysteries,
o-o
of why things are
o-o
the way they are.
o-o
So I think
o-o
I'll remember
o-o
most of it
o-o
for a long time.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's a joy to
o-o
really get to teach
o-o
what's important!
o-o
Now, back to what
o-o
doesn't have an
o-o
official name.
o-o
How about artists,
o-o
writers, composers,
o-o
and other people
o-o
who create things
o-o
that can be sold
o-o
for way more than
o-o
the cost of electricity
o-o
and art supplies
o-o
and creative software?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Clearly they deserve,
o-o
er, should get,
o-o
lower taxes on their
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's this called?
o-o
This thing of
o-o
imposing
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
on businesses
o-o
that efficiently
o-o
create things of value.
o-o
And imposing
o-o
higher taxes
o-o
on businesses
o-o
that waste resources.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Or don't attract
o-o
as much money
o-o
into the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
The only name
o-o
I've heard is
o-o
begin-italics tax the takers
o-o
more than the
o-o
makers. end-italics
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I like that.
o-o
People like me
o-o
who wanna make things
o-o
would earn higher
o-o
wages because
o-o
of those lower
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And corporations
o-o
would pay much
o-o
higher taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some corporations
o-o
would pay higher
o-o
taxes.
o-o
Other corporations
o-o
create lots of
o-o
valuable products
o-o
and services,
o-o
and they would pay
o-o
lower taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Which corporations
o-o
create value?
o-o
I thought that big
o-o
corporations
o-o
are predatory.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Admittedly
o-o
big corporations
o-o
do tend to be
o-o
greedy.
o-o
Yet when a biz
o-o
is young
o-o
and small
o-o
and sparsely
o-o
funded,
o-o
it can't grow
o-o
if it doesn't
o-o
offer something
o-o
that benefits
o-o
lots of people.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I have my doubts
o-o
about that.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Are there
o-o
examples?
o-o
Something from
o-o
history?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when Google
o-o
started out,
o-o
it gave better
o-o
search results,
o-o
and fewer ads,
o-o
compared to
o-o
other search
o-o
engines.
o-o
Amazon
o-o
started as
o-o
a bookstore
o-o
that gave
o-o
beginning
o-o
book authors
o-o
a way to
o-o
bypass the
o-o
monopolistic
o-o
New York City
o-o
book publishers
o-o
who were
o-o
inefficiently
o-o
renting
o-o
New York City
o-o
office space.
o-o
Bank of
o-o
America,
o-o
when it was
o-o
started in San
o-o
Fransisco,
o-o
it catered to
o-o
the special needs
o-o
of wealthy
o-o
Chinese
o-o
Americans
o-o
in Chinatown
o-o
back when
o-o
other banks
o-o
shunned those
o-o
people as
o-o
customers.
o-o
What's important
o-o
to realize
o-o
is there are lots
o-o
of begin-italics small end-italics
o-o
corporations
o-o
you've never
o-o
heard of
o-o
that benefit
o-o
lots of people
o-o
in lots of
o-o
wonderful
o-o
ways.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like with
o-o
rich people?
o-o
Some are good,
o-o
and some are bad?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
o-o
And I'm glad
o-o
you see that
o-o
simply taxing
o-o
wealthy individuals
o-o
isn't the key.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I learned
o-o
they can hide
o-o
vacation
o-o
homes,
o-o
ego hyphen-here inflating
o-o

o-o
and
o-o
rendevouz
o-o

o-o

o-o
they own.
o-o
So they can evade
o-o
individual
o-o
taxation.
o-o
'N exploit tax
o-o
deductions
o-o
in their
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it's harder
o-o
to figure out
o-o
which rich folks
o-o
deserve to be
o-o
wealthy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
None of them!
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Can you not think
o-o
of any wealthy
o-o
people who deserve
o-o
to earn lots of
o-o
money for their work?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
My boss,
o-o
and other
o-o
owners of small
o-o
construction
o-o
businesses
o-o
like the one

I work in.
o-o
And maybe

But he's a jerk.
o-o
And probably
o-o
his real reason
o-o
for going to Mars
o-o
is to evade
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
So was Bill Gates
o-o
in his early years.
o-o
Being a jerk,
o-o
I mean.
o-o
But here we're
o-o
just talking
o-o
about whether
o-o
they've done things
o-o
that strengthen the
o-o
economy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
Oprah Winfrey
o-o
deserves
o-o
her wealth.
o-o
And Stephen
o-o
Colbert
o-o
does because
o-o
he makes me
o-o
laugh about
o-o
the crazy
o-o
antics in
o-o
politics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They're all
o-o
in the political
o-o
up, along with
o-o
us voters.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's hard to judge
o-o
which individuals
o-o
are in what
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up versus down.
o-o
It's easier to do
o-o
with businesses.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
With individuals
o-o
we just need to look
o-o
at how much they give
o-o
to politicians.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Following the
o-o
flow of money
o-o
in politics
o-o
is like slicing
o-o
an onion.
o-o
There are lots
o-o
of layers
o-o
to cut through,
o-o
and it becomes
o-o
hard to see
o-o
because
o-o
tears come to
o-o
your eyes.
o-o
It's easier to
o-o
separate the
o-o
takers from the makers
o-o
in businesses.
o-o
We look at
o-o
what the biz
o-o
does.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What if the biz
o-o
does both?
o-o
Making and
o-o
taking?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
We can prorate it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Get professionals
o-o
to rate the
o-o
business?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Prorating.
o-o
It's another
o-o
kind of
o-o
division.
o-o
The math kind.
o-o
It involves
o-o
percentages.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, OK.
o-o
But my brain's
o-o
startin' to drain
o-o
'cause this seems like
o-o
sorting peaches
o-o
from apricots.
o-o
Is there some
o-o
pattern?
o-o
I mean
o-o
for sorting
o-o
takers from
o-o
makers?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
In general the
o-o
spectrum from
o-o
makers to takers
o-o
would be something
o-o
like this.
o-o
It starts with
o-o
farming and ranching.
o-o
Then to manufacturing,
o-o
cooking, brewing,
o-o
entertaining,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
inventing,
o-o
software developing,
o-o
oil refining,
o-o
research if it isn't
o-o
market research,
o-o
and other such
o-o
making activities.
o-o
Then to
o-o
teaching and training.
o-o
Then to healthcare,
o-o
grocery sales,
o-o
meat packing,
o-o
canning,
o-o
and maintenance.
o-o
Then to shipping,
o-o
retail stores,
o-o
hospitality,
o-o
and more.
o-o
Then to advertising
o-o
and marketing.
o-o
Then finally to
o-o
banking, insurance,
o-o
legal services,
o-o
real estate developers,
o-o
logging, mining,
o-o
casinos,
o-o
alcohol
o-o
businesses,
o-o
and the
o-o
tobacco
o-o
industry.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
o-o
Especially because
o-o
sleazy
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers
o-o
would be at the bottom
o-o
paying the highest
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
Now it's finally
o-o
so much clearer
o-o
who I should fight!
o-o
And how I can fight!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that better
o-o
voting methods
o-o
would allow us
o-o
voters to elect
o-o
politicians
o-o
who'd pass laws
o-o
that change business
o-o
taxes?
o-o
In ways that
o-o
would lead to
o-o
a stronger
o-o
economy?
o-o
So there's
o-o
a big flow of
o-o
money into the
o-o
United States?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And higher taxes
o-o
for businesses
o-o
that mostly earn
o-o
their money from
o-o
customers
o-o
inside the
o-o
U.S.?
o-o
Like law firms,
o-o
Wall Street banks,
o-o
and insurance
o-o
companies?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm not saying
o-o
what should be done,
o-o
or will be done.
o-o
I'm saying that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
would increase
o-o
if those changes
o-o
were made.
o-o
It would make
o-o
the cherry pie
o-o
so much
o-o
bigger!
o-o
Then everyone
o-o
can get
o-o
a bigger
o-o
slice.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'N it would only
o-o
decrease
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for a few people
o-o
who earn their money
o-o
by owning
o-o
taker businesses?
o-o
That sounds great!
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm ready for this fight!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey! I see a pattern.
o-o
The owners of
o-o
taker businesses
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
o-o
'N currently
o-o
their businesses
o-o
get so many tax breaks
o-o
they pay low
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
'N the owners
o-o
of maker businesses,
o-o
like the one
o-o
I work in,
o-o
'n the one
o-o
I'd like to build,
o-o
they're in the
o-o
political up.
o-o
Yet they pay high
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
'N get
o-o
few tax breaks.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Hey!
o-o
The economy's
o-o
like a bat
o-o
takin' a nap.
o-o
It's upside down!
o-o
We're taxin' the
o-o
fruitful makers
o-o
more than the
o-o
vulture takers!
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes,
o-o
in some ways
o-o
the economic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I see something
o-o
else!
o-o
Suppose law
o-o
offices
o-o
were taxed more.
o-o
Then lawyers
o-o
would earn less
o-o
than they do now.
o-o
That means some smart
o-o
pre hyphen-here law students
o-o
would abandon
o-o
their path to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs as lawyers,
o-o
and instead choose
o-o
career paths
o-o
that lead to
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
where their
o-o
salaries would be
o-o
better than now
o-o
because maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
would be taxed less.
o-o
That job migration
o-o
would use U.S.
o-o
brainpower
o-o
more efficiently,
o-o
for better
o-o
widespread
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
And the same thing
o-o
would happen with
o-o
people being
o-o
less attracted
o-o
to soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs on Wall Street.
o-o
But wait a
o-o
minute.
o-o
...
o-o
I think that might
o-o
mean a lower
o-o
salary for me
o-o
'cause I'm not
o-o
a smart guy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Does this guy
o-o
really not know how
o-o
smart he is?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
He hasn't done
o-o
much reading so
o-o
he's not book smart.
o-o
But he's very smart
o-o
in common sense.
o-o
Which is all too
o-o
uncommon,
o-o
alas.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If I'm so smart,
o-o
why'd I flunk
o-o
out of community
o-o
college?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Because you've got
o-o
a reading
o-o
disability
o-o
that schools
o-o
don't test for.
o-o
That makes schools
o-o
stupid.
o-o
Not you.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
My world's
o-o
so upside down.
o-o
In so many ways.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's fix that.
o-o
What's still
o-o
confusing?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I still don't know
o-o
why so many
o-o
people say
o-o
it's easy to
o-o
earn lots of money
o-o
just by workin'
o-o
extra hard.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That was true
o-o
back in the
o-o
nineteen fifties,
o-o
sixties, and
o-o
into the
o-o
seventies.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What changed?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Remember that
o-o
a big part of
o-o
World War Two,
o-o
in the nineteen
o-o
fourties, was
o-o
the bombing
o-o
of factories
o-o
and power plants.
o-o
That destroyed
o-o
lots of the
o-o
efficiency
o-o
that had been built
o-o
in industrial
o-o
nations.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't feel
o-o
brainy,
o-o
'cause I don't
o-o
see your point.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here's a question.
o-o
Which nations
o-o
did not get
o-o
their factories
o-o
destroyed by
o-o
bombs?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
The United States.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And Canada.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That gave the
o-o
United States
o-o
and Canada
o-o
a monopoly.
o-o
A huge monopoly.
o-o
What was it?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Factories!
o-o
Manufacturing!
o-o
The entire world
o-o
had to buy
o-o
manufactured
o-o
goods
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
and Canada?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Right.
o-o
So what's
o-o
that mean?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Huge amounts
o-o
of money,
o-o
to buy those goods,
o-o
flowed into
o-o
North America.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
'N that
o-o
monopoly
o-o
ended when
o-o
other nations
o-o
built new factories
o-o
to replace
o-o
the ones that were
o-o
bombed.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus again!
o-o
That's why U.S.
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
peaked in the
o-o
fifties and sixties.
o-o
That's when the idea
o-o
arose,
o-o
well resurfaced,
o-o
that anyone
o-o
could get rich by
o-o
working hard.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like when
o-o
there's a strong
o-o
enough updraft,
o-o
even slugs
o-o
can fly?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Be careful
o-o
where you're
o-o
standing when
o-o
that updraft
o-o
ends.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the
o-o
basic
o-o
idea.
o-o
When a nation
o-o
has lots of
o-o
money
o-o
coming in then
o-o
unemployment
o-o
is low
o-o
and wages
o-o
are high.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So during
o-o
the fifties
o-o
and sixties
o-o
the middle class
o-o
was bigger.
o-o
That fits with
o-o
what I've heard.
o-o
Now that the
o-o
middle class
o-o
has shrunk,
o-o
working hard
o-o
to earn wealth
o-o
is just bunk?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's something
o-o
called the Gini
o-o
coefficient
o-o
that measures
o-o
income
o-o
inequity.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
It measures
o-o
wickedness?
o-o
I love it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
You're thinking
o-o
of iniquity.
o-o
This is inequity.
o-o
As in
o-o
inequality.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
The Gini
o-o
coefficient
o-o
started rising
o-o
in the late
o-o
nineteen seventies.
o-o
That's when getting
o-o
to the middle
o-o
class became
o-o
a tighter
o-o
squeeze.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's when
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics elections
o-o
became common!
o-o
'N that's when
o-o
more rich
o-o
Republicans
o-o
infiltrated
o-o
Democratic
o-o
primaries.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's not just
o-o
a coincidence
o-o
is it?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Now you're getting
o-o
to something I
o-o
don't know.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So rising to
o-o
the middle class
o-o
based on hard work
o-o
is something
o-o
from the past?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Because of
o-o
increased
o-o
corruption!
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm not a
o-o
political scientist,
o-o
yet I can see
o-o
there's lots
o-o
and lots of
o-o
corruption in
o-o
the U.S.
o-o
And it's been
o-o
increasing.
o-o
But please
o-o
appreciate
o-o
that most other nations
o-o
are even more corrupt.
o-o
And never forget
o-o
that corruption
o-o
was worse in the past.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I need some
o-o
optimism.
o-o
Is there any hope
o-o
that the big
o-o
problems we face
o-o
can be solved?
o-o
Like global
o-o
climate change?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when horses
o-o
pulled wagons,
o-o
big cities faced
o-o
a big environmental
o-o
dilemma.
o-o
They predicted
o-o
that soon cities
o-o
would be knee high
o-o
in horse shit.
o-o
Yet that didn't
o-o
happen.
o-o
Not one bit.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They failed
o-o
to predict
o-o
automobiles
o-o
would take over.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So our current
o-o
climate crisis
o-o
is like being
o-o
ankle hyphen-here deep in
o-o
horse shit?
o-o
Except it's
o-o
invisible?
o-o
This is
o-o
optimistic?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What
o-o
predictions
o-o
are we failing
o-o
to see?
o-o
What
o-o
solutions
o-o
can solve
o-o
our huge
o-o
crises?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Perhaps
o-o
the biggest
o-o
overlooked
o-o
solution
o-o
is pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
You already
o-o
know that
o-o
will fix
o-o
lots of
o-o
bad feedback
o-o
loops.
o-o
And that will
o-o
increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
Yet I've also
o-o
read about
o-o
some other
o-o
promising
o-o
solutions.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What are those?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
I've read
o-o
about fully
o-o
synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon
o-o
fuel,
o-o
thorium
o-o
nuclear
o-o
reactors,
o-o
a fully
o-o
phonetic
o-o
writing system
o-o
that will reduce
o-o
illiteracy,
o-o
new programming
o-o
languages
o-o
that will
o-o
simplify
o-o
automating
o-o
things online,
o-o
open patents
o-o
as an aternative
o-o
to monopoly
o-o
patents,
o-o
dishwasher hyphen-here sized
o-o
kitchen
o-o
appliances
o-o
that will do
o-o
food prep using
o-o
robotics
o-o
controlled by
o-o
workers in
o-o
distant countries,
o-o
and a
o-o
years hyphen-here in hyphen-here prison
o-o
movie and game
o-o
rating that
o-o
will reduce crime.
o-o
Plus I've got
o-o
some personal
o-o
guesses.
o-o
There will be
o-o
better
o-o
micropayment
o-o
systems that help
o-o
individual
o-o
entrepreneurs.
o-o
And there'll be
o-o
higher
o-o
taxes on
o-o
businesses
o-o
that have more
o-o
salary
o-o
inequity
o-o
between
o-o
executives
o-o
and workers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
o-o
It makes my
o-o
gutter cleaning
o-o
tool seem
o-o
smaller than
o-o
a bikini
o-o
on a beach
o-o
in Rio.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
How do you know
o-o
about these things?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I've seen some
o-o
movies about
o-o
...
o-o
oh.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
I read.
o-o
It's a form of
o-o
time travel.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I read too,
o-o
but this is all
o-o
news to me.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
I mostly read
o-o
non hyphen-here fiction.
o-o
I skip over
o-o
articles that
o-o
are judgements,
o-o
such as who's to blame,
o-o
or what begin-italics should end-italics be done,
o-o
or what celebrities
o-o
are promoting.
o-o
Instead I like
o-o
to read about
o-o
why things are
o-o
the way they are,
o-o
which includes
o-o
lots of
o-o
history.
o-o
And when there's
o-o
a claim for a
o-o
solution,
o-o
I just focus
o-o
on its
o-o
advantages
o-o
and
o-o
disadvantages.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's blocking
o-o
those future
o-o
solutions from
o-o
happening?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Let me guess.
o-o
Feedback loops are
o-o
keeping those things
o-o
from getting
o-o
developed.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus again!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So there's lots
o-o
of feedback loops
o-o
blocking progress.
o-o
What's the
o-o
feedback loop
o-o
that blocks us
o-o
from election
o-o
reform?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are many.
o-o
As you've discovered,
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is just one part
o-o
of a feedback loop
o-o
that keeps owners
o-o
of many big
o-o
businesses
o-o
in political power.
o-o
And they oppose
o-o
solutions
o-o
such as fully
o-o
synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon
o-o
fuel.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
What's synthetic
o-o
whatever?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
o-o
refers to gases
o-o
and liquids that
o-o
are chemically
o-o
manufactured
o-o
for use as
o-o
fuel.
o-o
The process
o-o
would use sunlight
o-o
as the
o-o
energy source.
o-o
It would get
o-o
carbon from
o-o
carbon dioxide
o-o
in the atmosphere ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Which we have too much of.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
... and it would get 
o-o
hydrogen
o-o
from water.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So doing what plants do?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, but much more
o-o
efficiently.
o-o
Especially
o-o
compared to
o-o
using crops to
o-o
generate ethanol,
o-o
which involves
o-o
a few wealthy
o-o
people who
o-o
have a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
on ethanol.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If synthetic hydro ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
... is such a good thing,
o-o
what's blocking that
o-o
from happening?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's no
o-o
economic
o-o
incentive.
o-o
The people who
o-o
have the skills
o-o
to figure it out
o-o
cannot get paid
o-o
to do that
o-o
research.
o-o
And oil
o-o
companies
o-o
can earn more
o-o
money by
o-o
blocking that
o-o
research.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, more
o-o
feedback loops.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Instead it's
o-o
the lack of a
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there something
o-o
from history that
o-o
would reveal
o-o
how to make
o-o
good changes
o-o
happen sooner?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
When Kodak tried to
o-o
develop, so to speak,
o-o
color film for cameras,
o-o
their research labs
o-o
were only making slow
o-o
progress.
o-o
But two young
o-o
chemistry graduates
o-o
were making better
o-o
progress, so Kodak
o-o
hired them.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What was the secret
o-o
that gave them an
o-o
advantage?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
They were singers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The secret was singing?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
At that time
o-o
color darkrooms
o-o
were completely dark,
o-o
so there was no way
o-o
to see a timer.
o-o
Yet the chemistry
o-o
was very time hyphen-here critical.
o-o
So they sang songs together
o-o
and used the timing of songs
o-o
as their timer
o-o
for chemical reactions.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're saying
o-o
we need to
o-o
take up singing?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It illustrates
o-o
that breakthroughs
o-o
often require
o-o
sub hyphen-here breakthroughs.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So this means we
o-o
need to figure out
o-o
some kind of
o-o
innovation
o-o
that will help spread
o-o
the bigger
o-o
innovation
o-o
of fairer voting
o-o
methods?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Look for a way
o-o
to break the
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
that block fairer
o-o
voting.
o-o
Drill a hole through
o-o
the dam that
o-o
holds back
o-o
the flood of
o-o
fairness and
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
that
o-o
civilization
o-o
is waiting for.
o-o
Then voters
o-o
can elect
o-o
leaders who will
o-o
be begin-italics their end-italics puppets.
o-o
Until then
o-o
politicians
o-o
are the puppets
o-o
of the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
o-o
And typically
o-o
they earn their
o-o
money in ways
o-o
that've become
o-o
obsolete.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Any more tips?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
One way to fight
o-o
against bad
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
is to create
o-o
opposing
o-o
good feedback loops.
o-o
Especially
o-o
ones that increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
again.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Democracy
o-o
itself is a
o-o
feedback loop.
o-o
It yields
o-o
far better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
compared to
o-o
monarchy and
o-o
dictatorship.
o-o
That makes
o-o
oppressed people
o-o
jealous.
o-o
That jealousy
o-o
brought down the
o-o
Berlin wall,
o-o
toppled the
o-o
dictators in
o-o
eastern Europe,
o-o
and ended
o-o
the Cold War
o-o
against the
o-o
Soviet
o-o
Union.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow!
o-o
Jealousy
o-o
isn't always
o-o
a bad thing.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Feedback loops
o-o
are not always
o-o
bad?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good and bad
o-o
are just shortcut
o-o
ways to say
o-o
something
o-o
has lots of
o-o
advantages
o-o
or lots of
o-o
disadvantages.
o-o
But it depends
o-o
on who you are
o-o
as to whether
o-o
a change is an
o-o
advantage
o-o
or disadvantage.
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
that helps big
o-o
businesses
o-o
get richer
o-o
is good for
o-o
business owners
o-o
but bad for
o-o
their customers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, this is the
o-o
cherry pie
o-o
slicing
o-o
concept.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
And a feedback
o-o
loop can be
o-o
both good and bad
o-o
for the same
o-o
person.
o-o
It's like when
o-o
Henry Ford
o-o
paid his workers
o-o
higher than
o-o
usual salaries.
o-o
That increased
o-o
his labor costs,
o-o
but those
o-o
employees
o-o
could then afford
o-o
to buy Ford cars,
o-o
which brought in
o-o
more profits.
o-o
And something
o-o
similar
o-o
happens when
o-o
employees
o-o
can afford
o-o
to buy shares
o-o
of stock in
o-o
the company
o-o
they work for.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So shareholders
o-o
are shooting
o-o
themselves
o-o
in the feet
o-o
by not
o-o
realizing
o-o
that the
o-o
employees
o-o
and customers
o-o
can be,
o-o
or are,
o-o
also
o-o
shareholders
o-o
of their
o-o
company.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow, so many
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to learn about.
o-o
And yet
o-o
I've played
o-o
computer games
o-o
that took longer
o-o
to learn about
o-o
than what
o-o
I've learned
o-o
today.
o-o
About the
o-o
real hyphen-here world
o-o
economic
o-o
game.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Your insights
o-o
are amazing.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
But my head is full!
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
To help you see
o-o
how it all fits
o-o
together,
o-o
here's a thought.
o-o
Voting,
o-o
and taxes,
o-o
and subsidies,
o-o
and legal
o-o
monopolies,
o-o
and even jail time,
o-o
are all forms of
o-o
communication.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I can see that
o-o
voters try to
o-o
use their ballot
o-o
to say we want
o-o
more of this,
o-o
and less of that.
o-o
Alas, it's still
o-o
at the
o-o
mumbling stage
o-o
of communication.
o-o
But taxes,
o-o
how is that
o-o
communication?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I see!
o-o
It's a way
o-o
government
o-o
can use lower
o-o
taxes to say
o-o
let's have
o-o
more farming,
o-o
more stockpiled
o-o
emergency
o-o
supplies,
o-o
and more
o-o
international
o-o
sales of apps that
o-o
play stupidly
o-o
funny games
o-o
with pigs.
o-o
Higher taxes
o-o
on some
o-o
businesses
o-o
could say we need
o-o
fewer pirates
o-o
on Wall Street,
o-o
and fewer
o-o
businesses
o-o
that overpay
o-o
executives
o-o
while
o-o
underpaying
o-o
workers.
o-o
And Wall Street
o-o
executives
o-o
never going
o-o
to jail
o-o
gives the thumbs up
o-o
to financial
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, that makes sense.
o-o
Now hopefully
o-o
I can better
o-o
figure out how
o-o
to earn money
o-o
as an entrepreneur.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
To do that
o-o
you need to
o-o
understand
o-o
an important
o-o
business
o-o
concept.
o-o
So here's a test.
o-o
But don't
o-o
get stressed.
o-o
It'll
o-o
stretch
o-o
your mind.
o-o
What do these
o-o
people have
o-o
in common?
o-o
Steve Jobs,
o-o
Bill Gates,
o-o
Elon Musk,
o-o
Thomas Edison,
o-o
George Westinghouse,
o-o
and
o-o
Giovanni Marconi.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They are, or were,
o-o
rich entrepreneurs.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
And what else?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They got rich
o-o
through tech.
o-o
Technology.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
And what else?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's all my brain
o-o
can guess.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
This isn't something
o-o
I ever learned.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
They profited
o-o
from technology
o-o
that was created
o-o
by creative
o-o
geniuses.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah yes.
o-o
Steve Jobs
o-o
co hyphen-here founded
o-o
Apple with
o-o
another guy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Steve Wozniak,
o-o
who designed
o-o
and built
o-o
the circuit board
o-o
for what could
o-o
have been called the
o-o
Apple One.
o-o
And Apple hired
o-o
Jony Ive
o-o
who is a design
o-o
genius.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Bill Gates
o-o
co hyphen-here founded
o-o
Microsoft with
o-o
another guy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, Paul Allen.
o-o
They bought code
o-o
and renamed it
o-o
Microsoft
o-o
DOS,
o-o
so there were
o-o
creators
o-o
behind that
o-o
product.
o-o
Later there were
o-o
more creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
behind
o-o
Microsoft
o-o
Windows.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But not the
o-o
stupid ones
o-o
who put gaping
o-o
security holes
o-o
in it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Elon Musk
o-o
has hired lots
o-o
and lots of
o-o
really smart
o-o
engineers and
o-o
software coders.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
And now the
o-o
trick part of
o-o
the question.
o-o
Who are the
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who created
o-o
amazing
o-o
technology
o-o
breakthroughs for
o-o
Thomas Edison,
o-o
and George
o-o
Westinghouse,
o-o
and
o-o
Giovanni
o-o
Marconi?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I only know
o-o
one of those.
o-o
Nikola Tesla.
o-o
He helped
o-o
Westinghouse
o-o
with electrical
o-o
power stuff.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed,
o-o
he almost
o-o
single hyphen-here handedly
o-o
designed our
o-o
electrical
o-o
power grid system.
o-o
Yet Tesla also
o-o
invented
o-o
key parts of
o-o
radio
o-o
technology
o-o
that Marconi
o-o
commercialized.
o-o
And Tesla
o-o
also did some
o-o
inventing for
o-o
Thomas Edison.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So why doesn't
o-o
history
o-o
teach more about
o-o
people like
o-o
Tesla?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Who's got the
o-o
money it takes
o-o
to erect statues,
o-o
produce
o-o
biographic
o-o
documentaries,
o-o
and archive
o-o
the person's
o-o
scribbled
o-o
notes on
o-o
napkins?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
The people
o-o
who win
o-o
economically.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who do the work
o-o
get left out.
o-o
Both from profits
o-o
and historical
o-o
recognition.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's why I said
o-o
the important
o-o
part of history
o-o
is understanding
o-o
cause and effect.
o-o
And now do you see
o-o
what you should know
o-o
about entrepreneurs?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Alongside,
o-o
or behind,
o-o
...
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Or underneath,
o-o
getting stepped on.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
OK,
o-o
underneath
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
are the
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who create things
o-o
of value that
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
sell.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
And after
o-o
creating the
o-o
innovation
o-o
that starts the
o-o
business,
o-o
those creators
o-o
need to
o-o
create yet more
o-o
innovations.
o-o
That keeps the
o-o
business
o-o
ahead of
o-o
copycat
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Is this like
o-o
Walt Disney?
o-o
He created
o-o
lots of
o-o
innovations.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Excellent
o-o
example.
o-o
In his case his
o-o
brother Roy
o-o
handled the
o-o
money biz.
o-o
So having
o-o
a source of
o-o
great ideas
o-o
that become
o-o
innovations
o-o
can be a
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
Especially
o-o
if competing
o-o
businesses
o-o
don't have
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
working
o-o
for them.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, the
o-o
ethical
o-o
kind of
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe now you can
o-o
figure out how
o-o
you can make
o-o
money from your
o-o
invention.
o-o
Maybe by teaming up
o-o
with an entrepreneur.
o-o
You would be
o-o
the creative
o-o
genius.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If I could get
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It takes
o-o
lots of money
o-o
to protect
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought
o-o
getting a patent
o-o
was the hard part.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's just a start.
o-o
If it's a
o-o
valuable
o-o
idea
o-o
then other
o-o
businesses
o-o
will infringe on
o-o
your patent.
o-o
So you have to
o-o
take them to court
o-o
to protect your
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
And patent laws
o-o
favor big
o-o
corporations.
o-o
And China
o-o
mostly
o-o
ignores
o-o
patents.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That sucks.
o-o
Is there a way
o-o
to ...,
o-o
I don't know,
o-o
to win in
o-o
the business
o-o
world?
o-o
For someone
o-o
like me?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
The open patent
o-o
I mentioned
o-o
would help.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
How does that work?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
If it existed
o-o
you could afford
o-o
to register
o-o
your idea with
o-o
the patent office
o-o
without mortgaging
o-o
your house to pay
o-o
for a patent
o-o
attorney.
o-o
You'd get a
o-o
patent number.
o-o
You'd add it to
o-o
your LinkedIn
o-o
profile.
o-o
Then
o-o
corporations
o-o
would compete
o-o
to hire you
o-o
to invent
o-o
yet more.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
At a big salary!
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That path doesn't
o-o
yet exist.
o-o
So what should
o-o
I do?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Currently
o-o
corporations
o-o
don't know how to
o-o
hire, or even
o-o
recognize,
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses.
o-o
Not until
o-o
after they've
o-o
been the
o-o
co hyphen-here founder of
o-o
a wildly
o-o
successful
o-o
start up.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a very
o-o
tall wall
o-o
to climb.
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, alas.
o-o
Under current
o-o
conditions
o-o
only hindsight
o-o
reveals who's
o-o
a creative
o-o
genius.
o-o
When that
o-o
inefficiency
o-o
gets solved,
o-o
that will increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
so dramatically
o-o
that it will change
o-o
the economy
o-o
from a roller
o-o
coaster ride
o-o
into a rocket
o-o
ship blasting
o-o
into outer
o-o
space.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't most people
o-o
creative?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's like with art.
o-o
Thousands of
o-o
painters
o-o
have painted
o-o
portraits in
o-o
very creative
o-o
styles.
o-o
But the
o-o
Mona Lisa
o-o
stands out
o-o
as a style
o-o
that's not just
o-o
different.
o-o
It's also widely
o-o
appreciated
o-o
by millions
o-o
of people.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, that's why
o-o
you use the word
o-o
genius
o-o
after the word
o-o
creative?
o-o
'Cause the word
o-o
creative just
o-o
means different?
end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
alas,
o-o
most business
o-o
managers
o-o
don't understand
o-o
the different
o-o
meanings of
o-o
the word
o-o
creative.
o-o
And the word
o-o
innovation
o-o
also gets
o-o
misunderstood.
o-o
The value
o-o
of a product
o-o
or a person
o-o
becomes clear
o-o
only in hindsight,
o-o
not at the time.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So solutions
o-o
are waiting
o-o
for when there's less
o-o
stupidity
o-o
in politics,
o-o
business, and
o-o
management.
o-o
That's a

end-lyric
ambee sings-econhist amenn
Look at history.

World war three

known to be
o-o
a very stupid

for self hyphen-here interest

o-o
So there's time
o-o
to get

o-o
And doing that

easier than
o-o
what early
o-o
North American

o-o
had to do
o-o
to get

democracy.
o-o
They had to fight

with physical

And they won
o-o
mostly because
o-o
France and Spain

o-o

Now the fights

What about the

end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
During a time of

nationwide

starvation,

and massive

economic
o-o
suffering,
o-o
plus mass
o-o
stupidity,

non hyphen-here Jewish

Germans
o-o
to steal gold

o-o
valuables
o-o
from Jews.
o-o
Ironically
o-o
part of the
o-o
reason Jews
o-o
had become
o-o
wealthy is that
o-o
early Christians
o-o
were taught
o-o
they should not
o-o
charge interest
o-o
when lending
o-o
money,
o-o
so Christians

asked Jews

living in

lending.

end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes,
o-o
an
o-o
opportunity
o-o
to gain
o-o
money or wealth
o-o
is behind lots
o-o
and lots of
o-o
evil deeds.
o-o
Like when
o-o
Japanese
o-o
Americans
o-o
were put into

concentration

o-o
partly as
o-o
a way to steal

end-lyric

Why would I

do that?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Consider what
o-o
ended apartheid
o-o
in South
o-o
Africa.
o-o
It was secret
o-o
talks.
o-o
One of them
o-o
was between
o-o
Nelson Mandela,
o-o
and a
o-o
clergyman,
o-o
and the
o-o
clergyman's
o-o
twin brother
o-o
who led a
o-o
militant
o-o
group that
o-o
supported
o-o
apartheid.
o-o
Through talking,
o-o
Mandela
o-o
and the
o-o
pro hyphen-here apartheid
o-o
leader
o-o
discovered
o-o
unexpected
o-o
common ground.
end-lyric

Does this work in

o-o
I admit
o-o
I could use
o-o
some of those
o-o
kinds of tips.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Indeed.
o-o
But don't expect
o-o
you'll ever
o-o
find out
o-o
what's in the
o-o
other person's
o-o
mind.
o-o
Your goal should be
o-o
to seek a path
o-o
that benefits
o-o
both sides.
o-o
Talking helps
o-o
you find that
o-o
path.

And winning.

That's the only
o-o
goal I know.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Ah, yes,
o-o
winning.
o-o
Parents use
o-o
winning
o-o
prizes
o-o
to entice
o-o
kids to learn.
o-o
But the real goal
o-o
is the learning.
o-o
With maturity
o-o
we leave behind
o-o
the gold stars,
o-o
glitzy prizes,
o-o
trophies,
o-o
and eventually
o-o
the winning.
o-o
The skills
o-o
we've learned
o-o
remain,
o-o
long after
o-o
the prizes
o-o
are lost.
o-o
Now the skill
o-o
you seek is

Hello father.
o-o

o-o
I look forward to

o-o
so we can resume
o-o

end-lyric

Let's not talk shop
o-o
just right now.
o-o
I need to focus on
o-o
how to breathe

o-o
Stressful things

end-lyric

What other
o-o
protective
o-o
perspectives
o-o
can I offer?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
How can God be
o-o
everywhere?
o-o
How can I be sure
o-o
that God even cares
o-o
about me?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Try thinking of God
o-o
as being like the
o-o
principles of
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Elusive?
o-o
How is that
o-o
helpful?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
If you live
o-o
your life as if
o-o
two plus two
o-o
equals thirteen
o-o
then life
o-o
becomes hell.
o-o
But if instead
o-o
you live your life
o-o
as if two plus two
o-o
equals four, then
o-o
life becomes
o-o
joyful.
o-o
That's how God
o-o
is everywhere.
o-o
Just as the principles
o-o
of mathematics
o-o
are everywhere.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
I like that
o-o
outlook.
o-o
Why have I not
o-o
heard you say it
o-o
from your perch,
o-o
your pulpit
o-o
in church?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
There are some things
o-o
we can't preach.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Like what?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
If we speak out
o-o
with boldness
o-o
against war,
o-o
that would impair
o-o
our tax hyphen-here exempt
o-o
status.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
That's right!
o-o
Churches don't pay
o-o
property taxes.
o-o
Maybe I should
o-o
form a church to
o-o
get that sweet deal.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
What else can
o-o
you not say in
o-o
church?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Many ministers
o-o
manipulate
o-o
their flock by
o-o
transforming
o-o
guilt into shame.
o-o
But the best
o-o
ministers
o-o
transform guilt
o-o
into choosing
o-o
actions that
o-o
don't lead to
o-o
new guilt.
o-o
That shifts the focus
o-o
from resisting sin,
o-o
to adopting
o-o
high standards
o-o
of ethical
o-o
behavior.
o-o
But attendance
o-o
would suffer
o-o
even more
o-o
if we preached
o-o
at that higher
o-o
spiritual
o-o
level.

Perhaps this isn't

a great time to

understood why
o-o
religion
o-o
deserves to be

o-o
Especially
o-o
since religion
o-o
seems so, well,
o-o
antiquated.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
name-desha has some
o-o
thoughts on this.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Since before the
o-o
Roman empire,
o-o
people who were
o-o
not rich enough
o-o
to hire
o-o
musicians
o-o
gathered in
o-o
churches to hear
o-o
beautiful
o-o
music.
o-o
Now, anyone with
o-o
a bulge in their
o-o
pocket can listen
o-o
to any song at
o-o
any moment.
o-o
So churches lost
o-o
that advantage.
o-o
First to phonographs,
o-o
then to radios,
o-o
and now smartphones.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas, competing sources
o-o
of beautiful
o-o
music partly
o-o
accounts for our
o-o
congregations
o-o
being small.
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
people who love
o-o
to sing together
o-o
still gather
o-o
in our
o-o
worship hall.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And long ago marriage
o-o
in a church was
o-o
a way for a young
o-o
woman to trade sex
o-o
in exchange for
o-o
getting her husband
o-o
to attend church
o-o
and hear sermons
o-o
about doing good.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I must admit
o-o
my wife has wanted
o-o
me to attend
o-o
church with her.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Then governments
o-o
copied that idea
o-o
and now marriage
o-o
is done as a
o-o
civil ceremony.
o-o
Plus courts
o-o
and the
o-o
IRS
o-o
force
o-o
child support
o-o
and
o-o
alimony
o-o
payments from men
o-o
who abandon
o-o
their children
o-o
or their wives.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes, marriage
o-o
ceremonies.
o-o
That was a big
o-o
monopoly
o-o
churches had,
o-o
then lost.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
And churches
o-o
used to feed
o-o
the hungry.
o-o
Now that's done with
o-o
food stamps from the
o-o
government.
o-o
So that's one more
o-o
advantage lost?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Universities
o-o
and schools
o-o
were founded
o-o
alongside
o-o
churches and mosques.
o-o
Now,
o-o
governments
o-o
fund those too.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
So government
o-o
is taking over
o-o
increasing
o-o
morality?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Only some of it!
o-o
We still serve a
o-o
very useful service
o-o
of reminding folks
o-o
to act in ways
o-o
that are fair
o-o
and benevolent.
o-o
But religion
o-o
is about much more
o-o
than just ending
o-o
bad behavior.
o-o
That's just
o-o
the beginning
o-o
of the spiritual
o-o
world.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
A few
o-o
badly behaving
o-o
priests in the
o-o
Catholic Church
o-o
need to learn
o-o
from your wisdom.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas,
o-o
with low attendance,
o-o
there are fewer funds,
o-o
so churches can't
o-o
be as picky
o-o
about choosing
o-o
ministers.
o-o
And those of us
o-o
with the highest
o-o
ethics don't get
o-o
paid much more than
o-o
beginners.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
And the clergy sinners.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Recently
o-o
I learned
o-o
about a way
o-o
that crime can be
o-o
reduced without
o-o
churches being

involved.

money in politics.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I used to think that too.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
When you donate
o-o
money to political
o-o
candidates,
o-o
sometimes you give
o-o
to Democrats.
o-o
Am I right?
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Never!
o-o
I always vote
o-o
Republican.
o-o
And I never give
o-o
money to Democrats.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
But mother is a
o-o
Democrat, and
o-o
sometimes you
o-o
give her money
o-o
to donate to
o-o
a Democratic
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
That's only when
o-o
my political
o-o
consultant
o-o
tells me to.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So when Barack
o-o
Obama and
o-o
Hillary Clinton ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Those are vile names
o-o
to me and my friends.
o-o
Isn't that right

end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Let him continue.
o-o
This is interesting.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Some political
o-o
strategists
o-o
recommended
o-o
that Republicans
o-o
give money to
o-o
Obama during
o-o
the Democratic
o-o
primary with
o-o
the idea that a
o-o
black man could not
o-o
possibly win
o-o
the general
o-o
election.
o-o
With that strategy
o-o
they figured that
o-o
a Republican
o-o
would win
o-o
easily.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
You can't prove
o-o
any of this.
o-o
And without proof
o-o
there's no crime.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
The fight between
o-o
political
o-o
left and right
o-o
is an entertaining
o-o
distraction from
o-o
the real, bigger
o-o
fight between
o-o
political up
o-o
and political down.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
You're talking
o-o
more nonsense.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Who is the
o-o
political up?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Most of us voters.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
And who is the
o-o
political down?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
The people who
o-o
give the biggest
o-o
amounts of money
o-o
to politicians.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That includes you,
o-o
name-father-of-fiance no-space ,
o-o
and you
o-o
name-vc no-space .
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Oh dear lord,
o-o
my own daughter
o-o
is undermining
o-o
my church.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
She's your daughter?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Indeed.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Why do you think
o-o
I call him father?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
We all call him
o-o
father.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
This explains why
o-o
I don't hear her

end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Father is very
o-o
strick about that.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Since I'm not in
o-o
your church,
o-o
what should I call you?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
You can call me
o-o
name-minister no-space .
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
What?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
name-minister no-space ,
o-o
it's short for
o-o
Whittier.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Who are you
o-o
wittier than?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
It's spelled
o-o
W H I T.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So in grade school
o-o
they called you
o-o
dimwit and
o-o
half hyphen-here wit?
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
At that age
o-o
my nickname
o-o
helped me learn to
o-o
identify
o-o
immaturity.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
name-damien no-space ,
o-o
you were saying
o-o
something about
o-o
political up
o-o
and political down.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Vote splitting's
o-o
the reason
o-o
that money still
o-o
has so much
o-o
influence in
o-o
politics.
o-o
In the early days
o-o
of the U.S.
o-o
there were no
o-o
primary
o-o
elections.
o-o
Slowly voters
o-o
'n parties learned
o-o
that whichever
o-o
party had just one
o-o
candidate would
o-o
easily win over
o-o
parties that had
o-o
two or more
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So primary elections
o-o
were added to ensure
o-o
each party offered
o-o
just one candidate
o-o
in what we now
o-o
call general
o-o
elections.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
And the point is?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If we used
o-o
ranked ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
counting, then
o-o
Democrats could
o-o
have offered both
o-o
Obama and Clinton
o-o
as candidates
o-o
in the two
o-o
thousand eight
o-o
presidential
o-o
race.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah, so the tactic
o-o
of using Obama
o-o
to block Clinton
o-o
wouldn't have been
o-o
an option.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And wealthy folks
o-o
like yourselves
o-o
would not have been
o-o
able to stop
o-o
Clinton from winning.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
This is all nonsense!
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
It's making sense
o-o
to me.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Who's side are you on?
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
I am now on
o-o
the side of God.
o-o
My heart attack
o-o
has woken me up
o-o
to what's really
o-o
important in life.
o-o
And at the moment
o-o
I want the truth
o-o
to come out.
o-o
If there are hidden
o-o
parts of politics
o-o
that get revealed
o-o
here we can judge
o-o
it at that time.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I suppose you're
o-o
going to claim that
o-o
Donald Trump
o-o
won in twenty sixteen
o-o
because of money.
o-o
Well he didn't.
o-o
I didn't give him
o-o
even a dollar.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But you do give
o-o
to the
o-o
Republican
o-o
party,
o-o
and they paid to
o-o
promote Trump
o-o
after he won the
o-o
primary.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If the
o-o
twenty sixteen
o-o
Republican
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
election
o-o
had used ranked ballots
o-o
and pairwise counting,
o-o
the winner would
o-o
have been the most
o-o
popular candidate,
o-o
and that was not
o-o
Donald Trump.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
There were sixteen
o-o
other
o-o
candidates
o-o
in that race.
o-o
That split the votes
o-o
of the
o-o
majority
o-o
of
o-o
Republicans.
o-o
They wanted
o-o
someone other
o-o
than Trump.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
All Trump and his
o-o
promoters,
o-o
including
o-o
Russian hackers,
o-o
needed was to
o-o
win more votes
o-o
than any one of
o-o
the other sixteen
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
None of whom were
o-o
very popular.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Until the other
o-o
candidates
o-o
dropped out,
o-o
Trump was getting
o-o
less than half
o-o
the votes.
o-o
And that's just
o-o
Republicans.
o-o
He would have lost
o-o
under a fairer
o-o
election.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Who would have won?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
We don't know
o-o
because even
o-o
the sample polls
o-o
don't ask voters
o-o
for more than
o-o
their favorite.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
But Trump won the
o-o
general election,
o-o
so that proves he
o-o
was more popular
o-o
than Hillary.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
But with ranked
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting
o-o
there would have been
o-o
at least one more
o-o
Republican and
o-o
at least one more
o-o
Democrat to
o-o
win against.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Plus Bernie Sanders
o-o
running as an
o-o
independent.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Trump could not
o-o
have won such a
o-o
five hyphen-here way race.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that if we used
o-o
ranked ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting
o-o
then voters would have
o-o
more choices on
o-o
the ballot?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Even better than
o-o
more choices, the
o-o
choices would
o-o
include wise
o-o
problem hyphen-here solving
o-o
leaders.
o-o
Now the only
o-o
choices are
o-o
special hyphen-here interest
o-o
puppets.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Under current
o-o
conditions,
o-o
wise and
o-o
ethical
o-o
leaders
o-o
don't enter
o-o
elections
o-o
because they know
o-o
they won't get
o-o
support from
o-o
party
o-o
insiders,
o-o
who have to
o-o
cater to
o-o
people like you,
o-o
with lots of
o-o
money.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
These so hyphen-here called wise
o-o
leaders,
o-o
would they be liberal
o-o
or conservative?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Neither.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They would represent
o-o
the political up,
o-o
and would oppose
o-o
the political down.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So they're
o-o
anti hyphen-here business.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They would favor
o-o
fairness and
o-o
economic
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
er,
o-o
efficiency
o-o
in the
o-o
economy.
o-o
That would bring
o-o
prosperity
o-o
much greater than
o-o
what we have today.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Prosperity to who?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Widespread prosperity.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
That's impossible!
o-o
In order to have
o-o
winners there must be
o-o
losers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's what I used
o-o
to think. But
o-o
fighting wastes
o-o
precious resources.
o-o
What yields better
o-o
results for the
o-o
most people is
o-o
cooperation,
o-o
teamwork, and
o-o
working together
o-o
against a foe.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
I like this shift.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Did you just curse?
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Not everyone
o-o
can afford to fly
o-o
to London and
o-o
Paris. I agree
o-o
with father that
o-o
for there to be
o-o
winners there have
o-o
to be losers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
You want to fly
o-o
to London and Paris?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I've told you I
o-o
enjoy traveling.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought you meant
o-o
by car.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Back to the idea
o-o
of no losers.
o-o
Surely some folks
o-o
would lose out
o-o
economically
o-o
if elections
o-o
were more fair.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Yes, there are some
o-o
businesses
o-o
that exploit
o-o
begin-italics unfairness end-italics
o-o
and they would have
o-o
their profits reduced
o-o
because of
o-o
higher taxes.
o-o
And because of
o-o
fewer
o-o
monopolies.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Such as?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Did you know
o-o
we pay lots more
o-o
for sugar
o-o
compared to
o-o
the rest of the
o-o
world?
o-o
On the commodity
o-o
market there's
o-o
sugar number eleven
o-o
and sugar number,
o-o
...
o-o
ah,
o-o
...
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Sixteen.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
The price within
o-o
the U.S. is the
o-o
higher price,
o-o
and the lower price
o-o
is what the rest
o-o
of the world pays.
o-o
The people
o-o
who exploit
o-o
that legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
would lose income,
o-o
although they
o-o
would keep their
o-o
current wealth.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I'll bet that us
o-o
developers would
o-o
lose out.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Indeed!
o-o
Your business
o-o
taxes would
o-o
be increased.
o-o
'N you deserve
o-o
that 'cause
o-o
mostly
o-o
what you do is
o-o
buy land,
o-o
then use sneaky
o-o
election
o-o
tactics
o-o
to control
o-o
city councils
o-o
to change the
o-o
designation
o-o
of that land to
o-o
higher hyphen-here rent uses,
o-o
and force taxpayers
o-o
to pay for new infrastructure,
o-o
then hire workers
o-o
to build buildings,
o-o
and then you rent
o-o
or sell
o-o
the buildings
o-o
at inflated prices.
o-o
And doing all that
o-o
doesn't require
o-o
brains,
o-o
just
o-o
immorality.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
That's completely
o-o
legal.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes because you control
o-o
elected city
o-o
councilors,
o-o
and state
o-o
legislators,
o-o
and congressmen,
o-o
who write the laws.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
So tell me what
o-o
I really want to know.
o-o
Would taxes increase
o-o
on the businesses
o-o
I own?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Some would pay lower
o-o
taxes, and others
o-o
would pay higher
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
That's not specific.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Businesses that
o-o
exploit would pay
o-o
higher taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Businesses that
o-o
bring benefits would
o-o
pay lower taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
That's still not
o-o
specific.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Developers like you
o-o
would pay higher
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
On what basis?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
You do not bring
o-o
a net gain to the
o-o
local economy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
On the contrary!
o-o
People from elsewhere
o-o
would move here.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
And that would bring
o-o
money to you,
o-o
but would increase
o-o
traffic, and
o-o
it would increase
o-o
infrastructure
o-o
costs to those of us
o-o
already here.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Plus your business
o-o
requires lots of
o-o
regulation,
o-o
which is a drain
o-o
on city management
o-o
budgets.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Tell me which kinds
o-o
of businesses
o-o
would get lower
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
The ones that bring
o-o
money into the
o-o
region from outside
o-o
the region.
o-o
That includes
o-o
businesses that
o-o
involve software,
o-o
art, making things,
o-o
manufacturing,
o-o
entertainment,
o-o
non hyphen-here chain restaurants,
o-o
and such.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
They get lower taxes?
o-o
Why?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Because they
o-o
bring a net flow
o-o
of money into
o-o
the city
o-o
and county.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
You said non hyphen-here chain
o-o
restaurants.
o-o
Why not chain
o-o
restaurants?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
They send lots
o-o
of their profits
o-o
to corporate
o-o
headquarters,
o-o
which drains
o-o
money from
o-o
the city and
o-o
state where the
o-o
restaurant's
o-o
located.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
My business
o-o
hires lots of workers.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
But only
o-o
temporarily.
o-o
After
o-o
development
o-o
the jobs are gone.
o-o
The kinds of
o-o
businesses
o-o
that get
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
continue to
o-o
employ people
o-o
as long as
o-o
they stay in
o-o
business.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah, I think I'm
o-o
beginning to see.
o-o
Raise taxes on
o-o
activities that
o-o
drain the economy,
o-o
and reduce taxes
o-o
on activities
o-o
that enrich the
o-o
economy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Exactly!
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
So it taxes the sinners
o-o
and helps the saints?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a useful
o-o
way to view it.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
I like it!
o-o
Even though
o-o
it might offend
o-o
many of the
o-o
folks who need
o-o
religion
o-o
the most.
o-o
Like lawyers,
o-o
bankers, and
o-o
CFOs.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Aliens?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Not UFOs.
o-o
CFOs.
o-o
Chief
o-o
financial
o-o
officers.
o-o
Father takes
o-o
seriously
o-o
the saying
o-o
begin-italics know thine

end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
Our church
o-o
welcomes
o-o

o-o
Yet we do
o-o
promote
o-o
good deeds
o-o
and frown on
o-o
exploitation.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
So the
o-o
different
o-o
tax rates are
o-o
like the
o-o
difference
o-o
between a
o-o
word-resume
o-o
and a
o-o
eulogy.
o-o
A word-resume
o-o
values money,
o-o
a eulogy
o-o
values
o-o
benefiting
o-o
others.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Interesting
o-o
distinction!
o-o
What I've accomplished
o-o
would look fabulous
o-o
on a word-resume no-space .
o-o
But now it's time
o-o
to consider what
o-o
might be said
o-o
in my eulogy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I don't see the
o-o
difference.
o-o
But then religion
o-o
isn't my thing.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Lately, with the
o-o
worlds of business
o-o
and government
o-o
declining
o-o
in ethics,
o-o
we the voters
o-o
need to fight
o-o
for fairness!
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
So is fairness
o-o
or money more
o-o
important to
o-o
you?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Why can't we
o-o
get both?
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Getting to the
o-o
point, do you want
o-o
to earn more money
o-o
so we can afford
o-o
maybe a few
o-o
luxuries in life?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to build
o-o
a business that

provides something
o-o
that benefits the

o-o
My original
o-o
plan was to
o-o
manufacture
o-o
my leaf gutter
o-o
cleaning tool
o-o
so that fewer

people fall off
o-o
ladders
o-o
when cleaning their

o-o
Yet lately,
o-o
other inventions
o-o
have been popping

o-o
Most are for the

o-o
someone told us

about.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Your mind is in

o-o
None of that
o-o
makes sense.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Mmm, I'm
o-o
beginning
o-o
to see the
o-o
value of
o-o
creating
o-o
that kind of

business
o-o
if it gets
o-o

end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
As a
o-o
bachelor,
o-o
a kitchen
o-o
food prep machine
o-o
sounds like
o-o
maybe a good
o-o
alternative
o-o
to getting
o-o
so much takeout
o-o
delivered.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
a good fit.
o-o
Yet another
o-o
benefit of
o-o
taxing takers
o-o
more than makers
o-o
is that very smart
o-o
well hyphen-here educated
o-o
people would be less
o-o
attracted to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs in
o-o
banks and

ambee sings-desha amenn
And real estate.

Instead they'd
o-o
work where they
o-o
benefit customers,
o-o
and clients,
o-o
and the overall
o-o
economy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Well said!
o-o
And to the teaching
o-o
profession, which
o-o
could use the very
o-o
best role models
o-o
for students.
o-o
That's what Willie
o-o
does. She's a
o-o
teacher.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So who's going to
o-o
believe this nonsense
o-o
that different ballots
o-o
and different ways
o-o
of counting votes
o-o
is really going
o-o
to make things better?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
This situation
o-o
is like when women
o-o
demanded the right
o-o
to vote.
o-o
A few places,
o-o
like Canada,
o-o
Australia, and
o-o
New Zealand,
o-o
tried it.
o-o
Then a few western
o-o
states tried it.
o-o
The predicted
o-o
disasters didn't
o-o
follow,
o-o
so it was adopted
o-o
throughout the
o-o
United States.
o-o
And don't you think
o-o
it's made things better?
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Sometimes I wonder.
o-o
We don't seem to be
o-o
doing that well now
o-o
that women have
o-o
taken over.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Without Rosie
o-o
the riveters
o-o
working in factories
o-o
during the war years
o-o
U.S. soldiers might
o-o
have lost.
o-o
And a woman in
o-o
the White House
o-o
couldn't possibly
o-o
be worse than
o-o
what we've got now.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So name-damien no-space ,
o-o
do you agree with her?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
It makes sense to me sir.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So name-fiance no-space ,
o-o
do you still want
o-o
this guy as your
o-o
future husband?
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
So name-damien no-space ,
o-o
do you still want
o-o
to work hard so
o-o
we can enjoy a
o-o
nice lifestyle?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Willin' to work hard,
o-o
that I'm willin'
o-o
to do.
o-o
But how nice of
o-o
a lifestyle
o-o
do ya have in mind?
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Just a cute
o-o
three hyphen-here bedroom
o-o
house with a
o-o
fireplace.
o-o
And of course
o-o
a big backyard
o-o
for a dog.
o-o
But it can be
o-o
smaller than a
o-o
Saint Bernard.
o-o
And a
o-o
comfortable car
o-o
for road trips
o-o
and errands.
o-o
And sometimes a
o-o
trip to London
o-o
or Paris.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought our plan
o-o
was to enjoy time
o-o
at home eating
o-o
healthy food, and
o-o
relaxing on
o-o
the weekend,
o-o
plus spending
o-o
time with friends.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Of course all of that too.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
And of course
o-o
your mother and I
o-o
want grandchildren.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
If the worlds of
o-o
politics,
o-o
and business,
o-o
and the economy,
o-o
were not so
o-o
upside down,
o-o
then all of that,
o-o
plus a tiara,
o-o
would be within
o-o
our reach.
o-o
But now we're living
o-o
during a time
o-o
of transition.
o-o
I'm afraid
o-o
we could enter
o-o
a new dark age
o-o
if we stay on
o-o
the path we're on.
o-o
Instead I want
o-o
to help make
o-o
the world a
o-o
better place
o-o
for everyone's
o-o
grandkids,
o-o
even if that means
o-o
I, or we,
o-o
have to make
o-o
a few
o-o
sacrifices.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Oh father, what should
o-o
I do?
o-o
This isn't
o-o
the way I want
o-o
things to be.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
You are my precious
o-o
princess so I'll
o-o
continue to give
o-o
you money if
o-o
that's what it takes
o-o
to keep you happy.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
This puts me in
o-o
an awkward place.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
The fact that you
o-o
have to think about
o-o
which to choose
o-o
tells me that it's
o-o
me who should lose.
end-lyric
ambee sings-minister amenn
It's clear to me
o-o
that you love one
o-o
another, so
o-o
don't have doubt
o-o
about your love.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
There are plenty
o-o
of single jerks
o-o
with lots of money.
o-o
...
o-o
name-vc no-space ,
o-o
I'm not
o-o
including you.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
No offence taken.
o-o
And perhaps you're
o-o
a bit right.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
It's easy
o-o
to find a guy
o-o
who earns
o-o
good money
o-o
stepping on
o-o
people's toes.
o-o
But if he's young
o-o
he'll pick you up
o-o
in a pickup truck
o-o
double parked,
o-o
engine revving,
o-o
and honking
o-o
his horn.
o-o
Young mature men
o-o
are hard to find.
o-o
So do you want
o-o
money or maturity?
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
I want both.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Then it's clear that
o-o
you value money
o-o
more than you value
o-o
who I really am.
o-o
I'll clear out my
o-o
things in a few days.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Can we still be friends?
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Of course, provided
o-o
I can also remain
o-o
friends with name-desha no-space .
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Since you won't become
o-o
my son hyphen-here in hyphen-here law
o-o
I won't insist
o-o
on you not being
o-o
friends with this ...
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Skank.
o-o
That's the word
o-o
I think you want.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
Father taught me
o-o
long ago that when
o-o
someone criticizes
o-o
another it's
o-o
as if they're
o-o
pointing into
o-o
a mirror.
o-o
So the critic's
o-o
the one who
o-o
deserves their own
o-o
criticism.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Father, name-minister no-space ,
o-o
you've raised a great
o-o
daughter.
o-o
name-father-of-fiance no-space ,
o-o
after I'm recovered
o-o
we can talk more
o-o
about our project.
o-o
In the meantime,
o-o
I hate awkward
o-o
conversations,
o-o
and misty eyes
o-o
and tears that flow,
o-o
so it's time for
o-o
you,
o-o
name-father-of-fiance no-space ,
o-o
and your daughter
o-o
to go.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I promise that
o-o
my development
o-o
project will bring
o-o
great things to this
o-o
city and county.
o-o
Come my princess,
o-o
it's time to leave.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
Until you can get
o-o
all your stuff,
o-o
I'll pack some
o-o
clothes and such
o-o
in a box,
o-o
and I'll text you
o-o
when it's in the hall.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks.
o-o
And remember
o-o
I do love you.
end-lyric
ambee sings-fiance amenn
I know.
o-o
That's why I wanted
o-o
to marry you.
end-lyric
ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Let's get out
o-o
of this
o-o
inhospitible
o-o
hospital.
o-o
Bye!
o-o
begin-explain Door opens and closes. end-explain
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
Normally I'd
o-o
suggest lightening
o-o
up the mood with
o-o
some ice cream.
o-o
But times have changed.
o-o
So I'll just say
o-o
that was the most
o-o
entertaining
o-o
drama I've seen
o-o
since high school
o-o
prom night.
o-o
And I'll add that
o-o
you two, name-damien
o-o
and name-desha no-space ,
o-o
seem like wonderful
o-o
young people to me.
o-o
And I've learned that
o-o
I could use a
o-o
few new friends.
o-o
So if either
o-o
or both of you
o-o
want to come and
o-o
visit me at home
o-o
after I'm out
o-o
of this place,
o-o
you're invited.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm beginning
o-o
to see that not
o-o
all wealthy people
o-o
are bad.
o-o
But I've been told
o-o
I'm a bad hyphen-here ass,
o-o
and that's not going
o-o
to change.
o-o
So unless you like
o-o
being criticized
o-o
for your money quest,
o-o
staying away
o-o
might be best.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
As for me,
o-o
probably I
o-o
should call my
o-o
mother and be
o-o
a moocher
o-o
for a bit.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
If that gets old
o-o
you can come and
o-o
stay with Willie
o-o
and me.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
So is it true
o-o
what name-fiance said
o-o
about seeing love
o-o
for me in your eyes?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
You are very smart,
o-o
but sometimes you
o-o
can be so dense.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm not tall.
o-o
Or handsome.
o-o
As you know I've
o-o
got no money I
o-o
can offer.
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
The reason Willie
o-o
and I are single
o-o
is that we don't
o-o
tolerate jerks.
o-o
And most guys are
o-o
just that, jerks.
o-o
But you're not.
o-o
You have spirit,
o-o
a sense of fairness,
o-o
a willingness
o-o
to work through
o-o
rough times.
o-o
And you've got
o-o
a great ass.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
Wouldn't your
o-o
Willie be
o-o
jealous?
end-lyric
ambee sings-desha amenn
We're willing

to share.
end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn

end-lyric

in case you
o-o
wonder about
o-o
someone you've not

end-lyric
ambee sings-vc amenn
I can be dense too.
o-o
But even I know
o-o
that this

is when you two
o-o
should kiss.
end-lyric

name-minister no-space ,
o-o
do I need your

ambee sings-minister amenn
If you can tame

this wild lass,
o-o
then gladly
o-o
I give you her

hand.
end-lyric
ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't think
o-o
she needs to be
o-o
tamed.
o-o
She just needs
o-o
to continue
o-o
fighting against
o-o
corruption.
o-o
And that's a fight
o-o
I'm willing to share.
end-lyric

o-o
I need more love

appreciate.
o-o
So go for it

a better eulogy

that happen.

o-o
that's

The music notation will include many cases of 4/4 or 3/4 time
switching to 2/4 or 1/4 time for just one measure,
and then switching back to 4/4 or 3/4 time.
This occurs when there should be just one or two beats of music,
either silent or marked by a single note -- such as a percussion instrument or single clap --
when switching from a singer to a different singer.

Lots of people don't have time to read, but do have time to listen to audiobooks, so I need to raise some money to pay voice actors to perform the dialog -- and it's all dialog.

begin-lyric
In DC
o-o
we don't have
o-o
real democracy.
o-o
Money talks,
o-o
congress listens,
o-o
the rich get richer,
o-o
we're tired of bitchin'.
o-o
We want
o-o
real democracy.
o-o
Politicians,
o-o
both left and right,
o-o
they're puppets,
o-o
and it's us they fight.
o-o
We need
o-o
real democracy.
o-o
Primary elections
o-o
have awful choices,
o-o
those candidates don't
o-o
listen to our voices.
o-o
We demand
o-o
real democracy.
o-o
On primary ballots
o-o
we mark a single choice.
o-o
That's divide and conquer,
o-o
it throttles our voice.
o-o
We are overdue
o-o
for full democracy.
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
eliminates vote splitting.
o-o
It will give us leaders
o-o
who are hard&#45;hitting.
o-o
Computers can count
o-o
and give us
o-o
full democracy.
o-o
We want true reform,
o-o
and far less corruption,
o-o
not just a little
o-o
bit of disruption.
o-o
We want a future,
o-o
not a planetary eruption.
o-o
Give us ballots
o-o
where we can rank,
o-o
not just make a
o-o
single mark, no thanks.
o-o
We want our fair share
o-o
of economic pie.
o-o
You say there's too little?
o-o
You know that's a lie.
o-o
We want
o-o
full democracy.
o-o
We work harder
o-o
than those who push papers
o-o
at the top of their
o-o
tall skyscrapers.
o-o
We are workers
o-o
who get things done,
o-o
while rich profit from us
o-o
and steal all the fun.
o-o
We don't want power
o-o
over greedy bitches.
o-o
We just want to share
o-o
in just some of our team's riches.
o-o
We all benefit from
o-o
full democracy.
o-o
So give us ranking ballots
o-o
and give us pairwise counting,
o-o
else in economic debt to you
o-o
we will keep on drowning.
o-o
We can't buy your products
o-o
if we can't pay food and rent.
o-o
The less we get paid,
o-o
the smaller profits you're sent.
o-o
We sure can't buy stock shares
o-o
with what we earn from our toil.
o-o
Your grandkids won't inherit much
o-o
if the world you spoil.
o-o
Give us what we've earned,
o-o
and stop this planet's burn.
o-o
Give us pairwise counting
o-o
and full democracy.
o-o
Give us ranking ballots
o-o
and full democracy.
