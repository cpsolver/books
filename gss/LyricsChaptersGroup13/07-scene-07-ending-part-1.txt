ambee sings-vc-firstuse amenn
Father,
o-o
I've given lots of money
o-o
to your worthy church.
sentence-next
o-o
I've asked you here
o-o
because now I search
o-o
for a way to buy
o-o
the delay of death.
sentence-next
o-o
Please give me a reprieve
o-o
on my last breath.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister-firstuse amenn
Remember the
o-o
spiritual world
o-o
rests on top of
o-o
the physical world
o-o
that your body
o-o
is a part of.
sentence-next
o-o
It's like a
o-o
pyramid.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Too big
o-o
to fit inside
o-o
a museum?
sentence-next
o-o
I'm not
o-o
begin-italics that end-italics fat!
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
At the
o-o
pyramid's top,
o-o
the golden rule
o-o
of doing
o-o
good deeds
o-o
spiritually
o-o
must rest on a
o-o
solid foundation
o-o
of not doing
o-o
bad deeds
o-o
physically.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
No more
o-o
begin-italics Go Fudge Yourself end-italics
o-o
ice cream?
sentence-next
o-o
That's what you're saying?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Bingo!
sentence-next
o-o
I mean,
o-o
that's a great start.
sentence-next
Have you been
o-o
praying?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I've been trying.
sentence-next
o-o
But this
o-o
heart attack
o-o
has me scared.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To cast out fear,
o-o
fill your heart with love.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what your heart
o-o
needs lots more of.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I have no kids
o-o
and no real friends.
sentence-next
o-o
My money
o-o
brings pleasures,
o-o
but that's where
o-o
it ends.
sentence-next
o-o
Sadly,
o-o
I've not got a
o-o
loving wife
o-o
in my life.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course
o-o
women say
o-o
they want me.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet actually
o-o
they crave
o-o
outings
o-o
without me,
o-o
including
o-o
trips to the mall
o-o
to buy
o-o
cosmetics
o-o
that signal
o-o
begin-italics don't touch me end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Is there time to love?
sentence-next
o-o
Can it really heal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To love, first you must
o-o
let go of darkness.
sentence-next
o-o
Start with understanding
o-o
that money is not evil.
sentence-next
o-o
It's greed that is evil.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Is it greedy to want
o-o
to have it all?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
We are human,
o-o
so all of us
o-o
want it all.
sentence-next
o-o
But there's not enough
o-o
time or energy to
o-o
acquire it all.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
But there are
o-o
shortcuts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Most shortcuts
o-o
increase
o-o
suffering
o-o
for others.
sentence-next
o-o
That blocks you
o-o
from rising
o-o
spiritually.
sentence-next
o-o
And reaching
o-o
the highest
o-o
kinds of love.
sentence-next
o-o
Far above
o-o
criminals
o-o
and lawyers,
o-o
...
o-o
I mean
o-o
sinners.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why the
o-o
Bible declares
o-o
a camel
o-o
can squeeze through
o-o
the eye of a
o-o
needle
o-o
easier than
o-o
a rich man
o-o
can become
o-o
a loving saint
o-o
on earth.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Thank God
o-o
it's the camel,
o-o
not me,
o-o
who has to fit
o-o
through
o-o
that slit.
sentence-next
o-o
Admittedly
o-o
my spiritual
o-o
vision is
o-o
hazy.
sentence-next
o-o
Don't I need to
o-o
engage in
o-o
combat
o-o
against the
o-o
wicked evil
o-o
hiding in
o-o
other
o-o
people?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
If you're thinking
o-o
of stories
o-o
from news sources
o-o
and social
o-o
media,
o-o
remember they
o-o
sell your eyes
o-o
and your ears
o-o
to advertisers.
sentence-next
o-o
So they choose
o-o
dramatic news
o-o
and sound bites
o-o
that excite
o-o
your fears,
o-o
your anger,
o-o
your desires,
o-o
and your
o-o
laughter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Assault weapons
o-o
in the hands
o-o
of blind
o-o
pacifists
o-o
would never
o-o
qualify
o-o
as newsworthy.
sentence-next
o-o
Not even as
o-o
a Facebook
o-o
video.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet surely
o-o
there's no excuse
o-o
for the evil
o-o
lurking
o-o
in mass
o-o
murderers
o-o
and dictators.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas,
o-o
they do cling to
o-o
the disease
o-o
of evil.
sentence-next
o-o
Long after
o-o
getting
o-o
infected.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately,
o-o
eventually,
o-o
in a real
o-o
democracy,
o-o
the disease
o-o
behind evil
o-o
dies out.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What other kind
o-o
of democracy
o-o
is there?
sentence-next
o-o
Besides a
o-o
real one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Citizens
o-o
in Russia
o-o
can vote.
sentence-next
o-o
But popular
o-o
alternate
o-o
candidates
o-o
are jailed
o-o
or killed.
sentence-next
o-o
And the results
o-o
are rigged.
sentence-next
o-o
How real is that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Is there an
o-o
antidote
o-o
to evil?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes,
o-o
talking.
sentence-next
o-o
To people on
o-o
the other side.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Talking.
sentence-next
o-o
I do lots
o-o
of that,
o-o
as part of
o-o
business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Do you ask
o-o
questions
o-o
with a desire
o-o
to understand
o-o
the other person's
o-o
point of view?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Why would I
o-o
do that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Consider what
o-o
ended apartheid
o-o
in South
o-o
Africa.
sentence-next
o-o
It was secret
o-o
talks.
sentence-next
o-o
One of them
o-o
was between
o-o
Nelson Mandela,
o-o
and a
o-o
clergyman,
o-o
and the
o-o
clergyman's
o-o
twin brother
o-o
who led a
o-o
militant
o-o
group that
o-o
supported
o-o
apartheid.
sentence-next
o-o
Through talking,
o-o
Mandela
o-o
and the
o-o
pro hyphen-here apartheid
o-o
leader
o-o
discovered
o-o
unexpected
o-o
common ground.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Does this work in
o-o
relationships?
sentence-next
o-o
I admit
o-o
I could use
o-o
some of those
o-o
kinds of tips.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
But don't expect
o-o
talking will
o-o
fully unveil
o-o
the other
o-o
person's
o-o
fantasies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I don't need
o-o
to reveal my
o-o
fantasies,
o-o
do I?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Not those kinds
o-o
of fantasies.
sentence-next
o-o
Talking reveals
o-o
which fantasy
o-o
the other
o-o
person mistakes
o-o
for reality.
sentence-next
o-o
Like you
o-o
believing
o-o
evil is in
o-o
most other
o-o
people.
end-lyric
