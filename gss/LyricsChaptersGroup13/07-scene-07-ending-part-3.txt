end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes, I think I do,
o-o
although it's been

a long time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
What have you been
o-o
up to?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I've been working for
o-o
politicians,
o-o
and environmental
o-o
organizations,
o-o
and fighting
o-o
against nasty
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I'll bet you're one of
o-o
those awful protesters
o-o
who are protesting

against my latest

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're the
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
grrr,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
developer
o-o
behind the deaths
o-o
of so many wild
o-o
animals.
sentence-next
o-o
And the
o-o
cutting of
o-o
beautiful trees
o-o
on that
o-o
Smoldering Ashes
o-o
property?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
It's called
o-o
Slumbering Maples.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes,
o-o
I'm proud to say
o-o
that's me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If ever
o-o
there was a time

I'd like to swear

this is it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
I dare you
o-o
to swear
o-o
you wicked
o-o
vixenous

end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Changing the subject,
o-o
do any of you
o-o
have any questions
o-o
for me?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I have a
o-o
question.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do
o-o
religious
o-o
organizations
o-o
get tax
o-o
exemptions?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
since religion
o-o
seems so, ...
sentence-next
o-o
well, ...
sentence-next
o-o
antiquated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I believe
o-o
you have
o-o
some thoughts
o-o
on this.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since before the
o-o
Roman empire,
o-o
people who were
o-o
not rich enough
o-o
to hire
o-o
musicians
o-o
gathered in
o-o
churches to hear
o-o
beautiful
o-o
music.
sentence-next
o-o
Now, anyone with
o-o
a bulge in their
o-o
pocket can listen
o-o
to any song at
o-o
any moment.
sentence-next
o-o
So churches lost
o-o
that advantage.
sentence-next
o-o
First to phonographs,
o-o
then to radios,
o-o
and now smartphones.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas, competing sources
o-o
of beautiful
o-o
music partly
o-o
accounts for our
o-o
congregations
o-o
being small.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
people who love
o-o
to sing together
o-o
still gather
o-o
in our
o-o
worship hall.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And long ago
o-o
marriage
o-o
in a church
o-o
was a way for
o-o
a young woman
o-o
to trade sex
o-o
in exchange for
o-o
getting her
o-o
husband to
o-o
attend church
o-o
so he would hear
o-o
weekly sermons
o-o
about not
o-o
drinking so much
o-o
beer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I must admit
o-o
my wife
o-o
has wanted me
o-o
to attend church
o-o
with her.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now governments
o-o
perform marriage
o-o
as a civil
o-o
ceremony.
sentence-next
o-o
And they back up
o-o
the man's promise
o-o
with child support
o-o
and alimony
o-o
payments
o-o
if necessary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes, marriage
o-o
ceremonies.
sentence-next
o-o
That was a big
o-o
monopoly
o-o
churches had,
o-o
then lost.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
And churches
o-o
used to feed
o-o
the hungry.
sentence-next
o-o
Now grocery stores
o-o
get paid by
o-o
taxpayers
o-o
to do it.
sentence-next
o-o
So that's one more
o-o
advantage lost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Sadly,
o-o
for reasons of
o-o
attendance,
o-o
yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Damn handouts!
o-o
At my expense
o-o
no less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Originally
o-o
schools and
o-o
universities
o-o
were founded
o-o
alongside
o-o
churches
o-o
and mosques.
sentence-next
o-o
Now,
o-o
governments
o-o
fund those too.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
So government
o-o
is taking over
o-o
increasing
o-o
morality?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Only some of it!
sentence-next
o-o
We still serve a
o-o
very useful service.
sentence-next
o-o
We remind folks
o-o
to act in ways
o-o
that are fair
o-o
and benevolent.
sentence-next
o-o
But religion
o-o
is about much more
o-o
than just ending
o-o
bad behavior.
sentence-next
o-o
That's just
o-o
the beginning
o-o
of the spiritual
o-o
world.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
A few
o-o
badly behaving
o-o
priests in the
o-o
Catholic Church
o-o
need to learn
o-o
from your wisdom.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Recently
o-o
I learned
o-o
about a way
o-o
that crime can be
o-o
reduced without
o-o
churches being
o-o
involved.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Good golly
o-o
bonnie lass!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Movies and
o-o
video games
o-o
can get another
o-o
rating.
sentence-next
o-o
The added rating
o-o
would indicate
o-o
how many years
o-o
a person would
o-o
spend in prison
o-o
if they did
o-o
everything
o-o
shown on the

Harrumph!

That won't work.
sentence-next
o-o
What we need
o-o
instead
o-o
is law and order!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes we need
o-o
law and order.
sentence-next
o-o
But not the kind
o-o
based on the
o-o
TV shows
o-o
with that name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Those are based
o-o
on real police
o-o
cases.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes,
o-o
but races are changed
o-o
to protect
o-o
white supremacy.
sentence-next
o-o
Those TV shows
o-o
always portray
o-o
district
o-o
attorneys
o-o
defending
o-o
white criminals,
o-o
the guilty ones.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet in real life,
o-o
underpaid people

of color
o-o
more often get

arrested.
sentence-next
o-o
And they,
o-o
not rich whites,
o-o
are stuck with
o-o
district
o-o
attorneys.
sentence-next
o-o
The white
o-o
criminals,
o-o
the ones guilty
o-o
of money crimes,
o-o
hire slick lawyers
o-o
and get off
o-o
with no jail time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
You still haven't
o-o
answered my
o-o
question.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do churches
o-o
not pay property
o-o
taxes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Cities
o-o
with churches
o-o
have better
o-o
widespread
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
sentence-next
o-o
That follows
o-o
naturally
o-o
from what
o-o
churches do,
o-o
or used to do.
sentence-next
o-o
More prosperity
o-o
yielded
o-o
higher tax
o-o
revenues
o-o
for the
o-o
city's mayor
o-o
and the region's
o-o
king.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why they get
o-o
tax breaks.
sentence-next
o-o
In return,
o-o
churches
o-o
must be silent
o-o
about things
o-o
that might reduce
o-o
tax revenues.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
about warfare
o-o
and politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And abortion
o-o
in the case of
o-o
antiquated
o-o
Catholic churches.
sentence-next
o-o
That reduces
o-o
the future
o-o
population
o-o
by one
o-o
taxpayer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I wish my
