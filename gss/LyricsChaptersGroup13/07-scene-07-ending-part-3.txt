She criticizes you

sentence-next
o-o
And you're

her for thinking

money grows

So,

ambee sings-desha amenn
Quite the reverse.

ambee sings-desha amenn
I was

I have a

question.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do
o-o
religious
o-o
organizations
o-o
get tax

exemptions?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
since religion
o-o
seems so, ...

well, ...

antiquated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I believe

you have

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since before the
o-o
Roman empire,
o-o
people who were
o-o
not rich enough
o-o
to hire
o-o
musicians
o-o
gathered in
o-o
churches to hear
o-o
beautiful
o-o
music.
sentence-next
o-o
Now, anyone with
o-o
a bulge in their
o-o
pocket can listen
o-o
to any song at
o-o
any moment.
sentence-next
o-o
So churches lost
o-o
that advantage.
sentence-next
o-o
First to phonographs,
o-o
then to radios,
o-o
and now smartphones.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas, competing sources
o-o
of beautiful
o-o
music partly
o-o
accounts for our
o-o
congregations
o-o
being small.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
people who love
o-o
to sing together
o-o
still gather
o-o
in our
o-o
worship hall.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And long ago
o-o
marriage
o-o
in a church
o-o
was a way for
o-o
a young woman
o-o
to trade sex
o-o
in exchange for
o-o
getting her
o-o
husband to
o-o
attend church
o-o
so he would hear
o-o
weekly sermons
o-o
about not
o-o
drinking so much
o-o
beer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I must admit
o-o
my wife
o-o
has wanted me
o-o
to attend church
o-o
with her.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now governments
o-o
perform marriage
o-o
as a civil
o-o
ceremony.
sentence-next
o-o
And they back up
o-o
the man's promise
o-o
with child support
o-o
and alimony
o-o
payments
o-o
if necessary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes,
o-o
marriage
o-o
ceremonies.
sentence-next
o-o
That was a big
o-o
monopoly
o-o
churches had,
o-o
then lost.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
And churches
o-o
used to feed
o-o
the hungry.
sentence-next
o-o
Now grocery stores
o-o
get paid by
o-o
taxpayers
o-o
to do it.
sentence-next
o-o
So that's one more
o-o
advantage lost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Sadly,
o-o
for reasons of
o-o
attendance,
o-o
yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Originally
o-o
schools and
o-o
universities
o-o
and hospitals
o-o
were founded

by churches

sentence-next
o-o
Now,
o-o
governments
o-o
fund those too.
sentence-next
o-o
Public service

announcements

sentence-next
o-o
Such as

o-o
bare ground with
o-o
human turds.
sentence-next
o-o

disease.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
So government
o-o
is taking over
o-o
increasing
o-o
morality
o-o
and
o-o
civility?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Only some of it!
sentence-next
o-o
We still serve a
o-o
very useful service.
sentence-next
o-o
We remind folks
o-o
to act in ways
o-o
that are fair
o-o
and benevolent.
sentence-next
o-o
But religion
o-o
is about much more
o-o
than just ending
o-o
bad behavior.
sentence-next
o-o
That's just
o-o
the beginning
o-o
of the spiritual
o-o
world.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
A few
o-o
badly behaving
o-o
priests in the

from your wisdom.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Recently
o-o
I learned
o-o
about a way
o-o
that crime can be

reduced without
o-o

involved.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Good golly

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Movies and
o-o
video games

sentence-next
o-o
The added rating

would indicate
