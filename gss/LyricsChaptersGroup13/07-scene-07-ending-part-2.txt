Churches have a
o-o
very long
o-o
tradition
o-o
of bringing
o-o
benefits
o-o
to their
o-o
community.
sentence-next
o-o
One of those
o-o
benefits
o-o
is the marriage
o-o
ceremony.
sentence-next
o-o
It protects a
o-o
young woman
o-o
from pregnancy
o-o
until the man
o-o
publicly
o-o
promises
o-o
not to abandon
o-o
her or her
o-o
children.
sentence-next
o-o
Part of that
o-o
promise is to
o-o
attend church
o-o
where sermons
o-o
steer husbands
o-o
away from
o-o
drunkenness,
o-o
laziness,
o-o
and gambling.
sentence-next
o-o
It only seems
o-o
antiquated
o-o
now that
o-o
governments
o-o
perform marriage
o-o
as a civil
o-o
ceremony.
sentence-next

o-o
singing in church
o-o
on Sundays.
sentence-next

o-o
beautiful
o-o
music

to the ears
o-o
of farmers
o-o
and workers
o-o
who otherwise
o-o
didn't hear
o-o
much music.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Churches lost
o-o
that musical
o-o
monopoly
o-o
to phonographs,
o-o
then radios,
o-o
and now smartphones
o-o
and televisions.
end-lyric

o-o
people who love
o-o
to sing together
o-o
still gather

sentence-next
o-o
Hallelujah!
sentence-next
o-o
As another benefit,
o-o
churches
o-o
used to feed

the hungry.
sentence-next

taxpayers
o-o
to do it.

o-o
schools and

Now,

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
So government
o-o
is taking over

civility?
end-lyric

Only some of it!
