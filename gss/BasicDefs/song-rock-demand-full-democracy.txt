begin-lyric

In DC
o-o
we don't have
o-o
real democracy.
o-o

Money talks,
o-o
congress listens,
o-o
the rich get richer,
o-o
we're tired of bitchin'.
o-o

We want
o-o
real democracy.
o-o

Politicians,
o-o
both left and right,
o-o
they're puppets,
o-o
and it's us they fight.
o-o

We need
o-o
real democracy.
o-o

Primary elections
o-o
have awful choices,
o-o
those candidates don't
o-o
listen to our voices.
o-o

We demand
o-o
real democracy.
o-o

On primary ballots
o-o
we mark a single choice.
o-o
That's divide and conquer,
o-o
it throttles our voice.
o-o

We are overdue
o-o
for full democracy.
o-o

Pairwise counting
o-o
eliminates vote splitting.
o-o
It will give us leaders
o-o
who are hard&#45;hitting.
o-o

Computers can count
o-o
and give us
o-o
full democracy.
o-o

We want true reform,
o-o
and far less corruption,
o-o
not just a little
o-o
bit of disruption.
o-o

We want a future,
o-o
not a planetary eruption.
o-o

Give us ballots
o-o
where we can rank,
o-o
not just make a
o-o
single mark, no thanks.
o-o

We want our fair share
o-o
of economic pie.
o-o
You say there's too little?
o-o
You know that's a lie.
o-o

We want
o-o
full democracy.
o-o

We work harder
o-o
than those who push papers
o-o
at the top of their
o-o
tall skyscrapers.
o-o

We are workers
o-o
who get things done,
o-o
while rich profit from us
o-o
and steal all the fun.
o-o

We don't want power
o-o
over greedy bitches.
o-o
We just want to share
o-o
in just some of our team's riches.
o-o

We all benefit from
o-o
full democracy.
o-o

So give us ranking ballots
o-o
and give us pairwise counting,
o-o
else in economic debt to you
o-o
we will keep on drowning.
o-o

We can't buy your products
o-o
if we can't pay food and rent.
o-o
The less we get paid,
o-o
the smaller profits you're sent.
o-o

We sure can't buy stock shares
o-o
with what we earn from our toil.
o-o
Your grandkids won't inherit much
o-o
if the world you spoil.
o-o

Give us what we've earned,
o-o
and stop this planet's burn.
o-o

Give us pairwise counting
o-o
and full democracy.
o-o

Give us ranking ballots
o-o
and full democracy.
