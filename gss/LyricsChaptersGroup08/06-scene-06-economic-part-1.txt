end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn

o-o
Welcome to my

classroom.
sentence-next
o-o
Would you like some
o-o
pistachios?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm so
o-o
full of nuts
o-o
I could get a

dozen squirrels
o-o
through winter.
end-lyric

We're wired on

espresso.
sentence-next
o-o
So let's go!
end-lyric

I'm hungry
o-o
to learn.
end-lyric

We came to learn

the dark arts
o-o
of economics.

Please tell us
o-o
what will happen
o-o
in the world
o-o
of money
o-o
when elections
o-o
are fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
When vote splittin's
o-o
no longer
o-o
skewing
o-o
the outcome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not goat
o-o
spitting.
sentence-next
o-o
It's vote
o-o
splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We know it's
o-o
super
o-o
challengin'
o-o
to predict
o-o
the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's mostly what
o-o
us economists
o-o
are paid to do.
sentence-next
o-o
Predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are they,
o-o
well you too,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
usually right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sometimes yes,
o-o
and then we
o-o
use that to
o-o
rise up in our
o-o
hierarchy,
o-o
our academic
o-o
game of thrones,
o-o
such as getting
o-o
tenure.
sentence-next
o-o
Sometimes no,
o-o
and then we
o-o
apply for a
o-o
research grant
o-o
to study why
o-o
we were wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you get paid more
o-o
if you're wrong?
sentence-next
o-o
Do you own
o-o
a cracked
o-o
crystal ball
o-o
and a home
o-o
that has a
o-o
panoramic
o-o
view?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
your espresso
o-o
is showing.
sentence-next
o-o
Professor,
o-o
do you have a
o-o
general notion
o-o
'bout what will
o-o
change?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
in Washington.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course!
sentence-next
o-o
New laws
o-o
will outlaw
o-o
lots of
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And there will be
o-o
tax reforms
o-o
and other
o-o
new laws
o-o
that will
o-o
unblock
o-o
overdue
o-o
innovations.
sentence-next
o-o
Those changes will
o-o
dramatically
o-o
increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for the regions
o-o
where those reforms
o-o
are adopted.
sentence-next
o-o
You're aware
o-o
there's lots of
o-o
corruption,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Oh yes!
sentence-next
o-o
That's
o-o
why we're here.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's your
o-o
justification?
sentence-next
o-o
For that prediction?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That trend has been
o-o
going on throughout
o-o
civilization
o-o
and history.
sentence-next
o-o
Not counting
o-o
setbacks
o-o
caused by
o-o
large hyphen-here scale
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
especially
o-o
civil war
o-o
and
o-o
international
o-o
warfare.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can you
o-o
explain why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Imagine the economy
o-o
as a strawberry pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not fond of
o-o
strawberry pie.
sentence-next
o-o
And apple pie
o-o
is tasteless
o-o
to me as a
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Can we make it
o-o
tastier
o-o
and fill it
o-o
with cherries?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course. Now
o-o
imagine the economy
o-o
is a cherry pie.
sentence-next
o-o
If some people
o-o
cut themselves
o-o
a slice that is
o-o
too big, then other
o-o
people end up with
o-o
smaller slices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm following this.
sentence-next
o-o
Wow!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What would you like
o-o
to call the people
o-o
who take too big
o-o
of a slice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
People in the
o-o
political down.
sentence-next
o-o
As opposed to the
o-o
political left
o-o
'n political
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'N we
o-o
the people,
o-o
who get too little,
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Bravo!
sentence-next
o-o
I'll bet you
o-o
had to struggle
o-o
to get your
o-o
bearings
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
jungle.
sentence-next
o-o
So,
o-o
the way I see it,
o-o
if elections
o-o
were fair,
o-o
then elected
o-o
leaders
o-o
would care
o-o
more about
o-o
the people
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up,
o-o
where most
o-o
of us are,
o-o
who get too little
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the part
o-o
we've figured
o-o
out.
sentence-next
o-o
And that
o-o
replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
wouldn't lie
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
as much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some
o-o
politicians
o-o
will be replaced.
sentence-next
o-o
Other politicians
o-o
will get re hyphen-here elected
o-o
because they will
o-o
shift their
o-o
priorities
o-o
to better match
o-o
voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Makes sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Currently
o-o
they're
o-o
handcuffed
o-o
by their
o-o
biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
sentence-next
o-o
The shift will
o-o
set them free
o-o
to do what we,
o-o
the majority
o-o
of voters want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course some
o-o
politicians
o-o
lack souls.
sentence-next
o-o
They'll
o-o
persist
o-o
in being
o-o
ass ...,
o-o
er,
o-o
jerks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And remember
o-o
those tax reforms
o-o
and other laws
o-o
I mentioned.
o-o
Those will do
o-o
what amounts to
o-o
creating
o-o
more
o-o
cherry pies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'd jump to
o-o
the second
o-o
and third pies
o-o
right away.
sentence-next
o-o
And I have to say,
o-o
so far
o-o
this is
o-o
easier
o-o
than playing
o-o
air guitar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When I took
o-o
economics
o-o
one oh one,
o-o
it wasn't
o-o
this fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We'll get to some
o-o
complicated
o-o
bits swiftly,
o-o
and they involve
o-o
bits of
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o
not silly
o-o
wonky
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
I learned some.
sentence-next
o-o
But I'm done
o-o
with the past.
sentence-next
o-o
It's gone.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do people
o-o
dwell on that
o-o
old stuffy
o-o
stuff?
sentence-next
o-o
Other than
o-o
using it
o-o
to play
o-o
trivia
o-o
games.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here I'm walking
o-o
backwards.
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
this is like
o-o
moving forward
o-o
in time.
sentence-next
o-o
The future
o-o
is behind me
o-o
where I
o-o
cannot see.
sentence-next
o-o
So I look
o-o
where I've been.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the past.
sentence-next
o-o
The patterns
o-o
give me clues
o-o
about
o-o
that which is
o-o
yet to be.
sentence-next
o-o
So history
o-o
is like a
o-o
crystal ball.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I see!
sentence-next
o-o
History
o-o
is a preview
o-o
of the future.
sentence-next
o-o
Who knew?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Probably
o-o
whoever
o-o
said
o-o
history
o-o
doesn't always
o-o
repeat itself,
o-o
but usually
o-o
it rhymes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Many people
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
think history
o-o
is mostly
o-o
recalling
o-o
facts about
o-o
the past.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In a history
o-o
trivia contest
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would beat me
o-o
like the loudest
o-o
drum in a
o-o
marchin' band.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would be
o-o
a great way
o-o
to learn
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wikipedia is wrong
o-o
lots of the time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
About cults,
o-o
including
o-o
religious,
o-o
political,
o-o
racial,
o-o
and
o-o
corporate
o-o
cults,
o-o
sure.
sentence-next
o-o
But Wikipedia
o-o
is usually
o-o
right about
o-o
non hyphen-here recent
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
Also about
o-o
non hyphen-here medical
o-o
biochemistry,
o-o
basic
o-o
mathematics,
o-o
and movie plots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My eyes are
o-o
cryin'
o-o
just thinkin'
o-o
about reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
so much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said that
o-o
reading glasses
o-o
with a blue tint
o-o
helps with books.
sentence-next
o-o
A good browser
o-o
can change
o-o
Wikipedia's
o-o
white background
o-o
to blue.
sentence-next
o-o
See how that looks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll give that
o-o
trick a try.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Rather than facts,
o-o
what's more useful
o-o
regarding
o-o
history
o-o
is causation.
sentence-next
o-o
Cause and effect.
sentence-next
o-o
And the ones
o-o
that involve
o-o
a surprise
o-o
are the insights
o-o
you should
o-o
prize.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can ya translate
o-o
that into a
o-o
for instance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's start with the
o-o
nineteen fifties
o-o
and nineteen sixties
o-o
and into the
o-o
nineteen seventies.
sentence-next
o-o
Why was the
o-o
U.S.
o-o
economy
o-o
so
o-o
prosperous?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That was before
o-o
my time so
o-o
I don't know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This has to do
o-o
with World War Two,
o-o
doesn't it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
That war happened
o-o
back in, ...
sentence-next
o-o
well it ended in
o-o
nineteen forty five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Well,
o-o
the
o-o
boomer babies
o-o
were born
o-o
and raised.
sentence-next
o-o
That
o-o
increased
o-o
consumption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wasn't around,
o-o
so I don't know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Does this have
o-o
anything to do with
o-o
not getting bombed
o-o
here in the U.S.?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Except at Pearl
o-o
Harbor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Factories
o-o
and power plants
o-o
throughout
o-o
the world
o-o
were bombed,
o-o
except in
o-o
the United States,
o-o
Canada,
o-o
and less hyphen-here accessible
o-o
parts of
o-o
Russia.
sentence-next
o-o
Why was that
o-o
noteworthy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Anyone who wanted
o-o
a factory job
o-o
could get one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
What else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Didn't factory jobs
o-o
pay well back then?
sentence-next
o-o
Well enough
o-o
to buy a house?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
and what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't feel
o-o
brainy,
o-o
'cause I don't
o-o
see where
o-o
you're going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What's that called
o-o
when there is only
o-o
one place that sells
o-o
what people
o-o
want to buy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
a monopoly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Oh yeah,
o-o
the entire world
o-o
had to buy
o-o
manufactured
o-o
goods
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
and Canada
o-o
and Russia.
sentence-next
o-o
Because other
o-o
factories
o-o
on the planet
o-o
had become
o-o
dinosaurs,
o-o
wiped out by
o-o
bombs instead
o-o
of an
o-o
asteroid.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And when there's
o-o
a monopoly
o-o
the seller
o-o
can sell
o-o
at high prices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And that big
o-o
flow of money
o-o
to factories
o-o
meant higher
o-o
wages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great thinking!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wait a minute!
sentence-next
o-o
Is that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity 
o-o
what voters
o-o
think of
o-o
when they hear
o-o
the slogan
o-o
about making
o-o
America
o-o
great again?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this is why
o-o
the reverse hyphen-here raccoon hyphen-here eyed guy
o-o
with the never hyphen-here changing tie
o-o
got so many votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But he blames
o-o
immigrants
o-o
and blacks
o-o
and women
o-o
for the bad
o-o
economy
o-o
we have now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
As the son of
o-o
an immigrant
o-o
family,
o-o
from India,
o-o
I too think
o-o
that's ironic.
sentence-next
o-o
Even worse,
o-o
for voters,
o-o
it's foolish
o-o
to think
o-o
we can regain
o-o
that prior
o-o
prosperity
o-o
by building
o-o
factories.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you see why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The monopoly
o-o
ended.
sentence-next
o-o
Other nations
o-o
built new
o-o
factories.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does this mean
o-o
the belief
o-o
that anyone
o-o
can get rich by
o-o
working hard
o-o
has reached
o-o
its expiration
o-o
date?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
History
o-o
reveals
o-o
that prosperity
o-o
happens when a
o-o
city, nation,
o-o
or region
o-o
sells something
o-o
that people outside
o-o
the region
o-o
either need or
o-o
strongly desire.
sentence-next
o-o
And it's not
o-o
available from
o-o
anywhere else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are just
o-o
short blips
o-o
that pass
o-o
like fads,
o-o
right?
end-lyric
