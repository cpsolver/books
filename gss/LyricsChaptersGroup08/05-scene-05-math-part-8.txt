ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
The picky
o-o
terminology
o-o
is another
o-o
reason we
o-o
don't teach
o-o
this stuff.
sentence-next
o-o
Except to some
o-o
graduate
o-o
students.
sentence-next
o-o
Mathematically
o-o
what makes more sense
o-o
is to use
o-o
the name
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
voting
o-o
to mean any
o-o
counting method
o-o
that uses
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that other
o-o
name important?
sentence-next
o-o
Transfer
o-o
something.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've already
o-o
learned the
o-o
basic concept.
sentence-next
o-o
That name
o-o
just refers to
o-o
some specific
o-o
math details
o-o
about using
o-o
ranked
o-o
choice ballots
o-o
to elect
o-o
two or more
o-o
winners
o-o
from the same
o-o
bigger district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the
o-o
proportional
o-o
representation
o-o
part,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's the part
o-o
where two or more
o-o
politicians
o-o
represent
o-o
the same larger
o-o
district.
sentence-next
o-o
The statewide seats
o-o
are needed
o-o
to yield
o-o
fully
o-o
proportional
o-o
results.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
too mind hyphen-here bending
o-o
for math hyphen-here phobic
o-o
voters
o-o
to swallow
o-o
and digest?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The ballots
o-o
can be counted
o-o
by hand
o-o
when an
o-o
official
o-o
recount
o-o
is needed.
sentence-next
o-o
Or as a
o-o
demonstration
o-o
of what happens
o-o
inside a
o-o
computer.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's say there's
o-o
uncertainty
o-o
about which of
o-o
the top four
o-o
candidates
o-o
really won.
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine
o-o
six people
o-o
sitting at a
o-o
long table.
sentence-next
o-o
Each of those
o-o
counters
o-o
looks at each
o-o
ballot and then
o-o
passes it on
o-o
to the next
o-o
counter.
sentence-next
o-o
Each counter
o-o
does a tally
o-o
for just one
o-o
specific
o-o
pair of
o-o
candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
When the counting
o-o
is done,
o-o
each counter
o-o
writes their
o-o
three count numbers
o-o
on a sign
o-o
so that watchers
o-o
can see who won
o-o
each of those
o-o
one hyphen-here on hyphen-here one
o-o
contests.
sentence-next
o-o
Significantly
o-o
that pairwise
o-o
counting process
o-o
only needs to
o-o
be done once.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You said sometimes
o-o
there's no
o-o
pairwise losing
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
What happens then?
sentence-next
o-o
For counting
o-o
by hand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's say that
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
is used
o-o
to choose
o-o
which candidate
o-o
to eliminate
o-o
when there's
o-o
no pairwise
o-o
losing candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
Then one person
o-o
can sort the
o-o
paper ballots
o-o
into piles
o-o
according
o-o
to which of the
o-o
remaining
o-o
candidates
o-o
is highest
o-o
ranked on
o-o
each ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
The pile
o-o
with the fewest
o-o
ballots
o-o
identifies
o-o
which candidate
o-o
to eliminate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that
o-o
combination
o-o
method
o-o
good enough
o-o
for real
o-o
elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
It pole vaults us
o-o
almost as high
o-o
as the best
o-o
counting
o-o
methods.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's its name?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Election
o-o
methods
o-o
are like
o-o
food recipies.
sentence-next
o-o
Switching an
o-o
ingredient
o-o
or two
o-o
can cause it 
o-o
to fail.
sentence-next
o-o
Even if the name
o-o
remains the same.
sentence-next
o-o
Basically
o-o
this is instant
o-o
runoff voting
o-o
with pairwise
o-o
eliminations,
o-o
plus correctly
o-o
counting
o-o
so hyphen-here called
o-o
overvotes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the
o-o
barrier
o-o
against using
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Up until a few
o-o
decades ago,
o-o
when computers
o-o
came along,
o-o
doing the math
o-o
by hand
o-o
was the big
o-o
barrier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But now we have
o-o
computers,
o-o
so what's
o-o
stopping us
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fear.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
a fear of math.
sentence-next
o-o
Officially
o-o
that's called
o-o
mathematical
o-o
anxiety.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of people
o-o
have it 'cause
o-o
most people
o-o
don't trust what
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Math
o-o
anxiety.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what I
o-o
was infected
o-o
by.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You're
o-o
disinfected
o-o
now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Already
o-o
the bleach scent
o-o
isn't evident.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Another
o-o
barrier
o-o
is that
o-o
lots of money
o-o
is given to
o-o
people who
o-o
misrepresent
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
voting.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as pointing
o-o
to high rates
o-o
of spoiled
o-o
ballots
o-o
in elections
o-o
that don't count
o-o
so hyphen-here called
o-o
overvotes.
sentence-next
o-o
And of course
o-o
pointing out
o-o
the two failures
o-o
in Burlington
o-o
and Alaska
o-o
without mentioning
o-o
those failures
o-o
are easy
o-o
to avoid
o-o
by eliminating
o-o
pairwise losing
o-o
candidates
o-o
when they occur.
sentence-next
o-o
And some of those
o-o
critics
o-o
claim that
o-o
score ballots
o-o
are better than
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are score ballots
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They collect
o-o
more information.
sentence-next
o-o
However
o-o
a savvy voter
o-o
can exaggerate
o-o
the strength
o-o
of their
o-o
preferences.
sentence-next
o-o
Similar to
o-o
the clapping
o-o
tactic.
sentence-next
o-o
Eventually
o-o
in the distant
o-o
future there
o-o
might be ways
o-o
to use those
o-o
ballots for
o-o
elections
o-o
that involve
o-o
multiple
o-o
winners.
sentence-next
o-o
But they
o-o
aren't fair
o-o
when electing
o-o
a single winner
o-o
in a general
o-o
election.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the counting
o-o
method matters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here's a way
o-o
to see why.
sentence-next
o-o
These colored blocks
o-o
represent
o-o
ten ballots,
o-o
and the colors
o-o
represent
o-o
four
o-o
ice cream
o-o
flavors.
end-lyric

end-paragraph-centered

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's the point
o-o
of playing with
o-o
colored blocks?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Each stack
o-o
represents
o-o
one ranked choice
o-o
ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
The voter's
o-o
favorite
o-o
is on top.
sentence-next
o-o
Their least hyphen-here favorite
o-o
is on the
o-o
bottom.
sentence-next
o-o
The winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla,
o-o
depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As usual,
o-o
brown always
o-o
loses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
plurality voting,
o-o
what we use now,
o-o
just looks at
o-o
the blocks on top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Instant runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
also looks at
o-o
the top blocks.
sentence-next
o-o
But then the one
o-o
that appears
o-o
to be least
o-o
popular
o-o
is removed.
sentence-next
o-o
That repeats
o-o
until one
o-o
color remains.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm guessing
o-o
pairwise counting
o-o
is the third
o-o
counting method?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So now
o-o
do we know
o-o
all about voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And how math
o-o
can solve the
o-o
conflicts
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Another bit
o-o
you can learn
o-o
about later,
o-o
when you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
It will be
o-o
improvements
o-o
in how members
o-o
of Congress,
o-o
or a
o-o
parliament,
o-o
or a state
o-o
legislature,
o-o
will vote to
o-o
decide which
o-o
bills should pass
o-o
to become
o-o
laws.
sentence-next
o-o
But getting
o-o
that math right
o-o
is too advanced
o-o
for you now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
not giving
o-o
my drowning
o-o
birdbrain
o-o
a migraine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet you should know
o-o
that electing
o-o
city council
o-o
members
o-o
sometimes
o-o
doesn't involve
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
In that case
o-o
having three
o-o
councilors
o-o
from each district
o-o
is a good choice.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What does that
o-o
accomplish?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With the math
o-o
we've been
o-o
talking about,
o-o
if the winner
o-o
of the first seat
o-o
is backed by
o-o
lots of money
o-o
from business 
o-o
owners,
o-o
the second hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner will
o-o
represent
o-o
employees,
o-o
because they
o-o
outnumber
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
The third seat
o-o
is won by
o-o
whoever
o-o
is not well
o-o
represented
o-o
by the first two
o-o
winners.
sentence-next
o-o
That yields
o-o
representative
o-o
diversity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this protects
o-o
against
o-o
getting just
o-o
males,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If that's
o-o
important
o-o
politically,
o-o
yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Finally!
sentence-next
o-o
Representation
o-o
for more women!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How about
o-o
minorities?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If that's what
o-o
enough
o-o
voters want,
o-o
then yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow.
sentence-next
o-o
Math is
o-o
magical!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you don't
o-o
mind hearing a
o-o
percentage,
o-o
the counting
o-o
guarantees
o-o
representation
o-o
for at least
o-o
sixty six
o-o
percent of
o-o
voters.
sentence-next
o-o
That's much much
o-o
better than
o-o
no guarantee,
o-o
which is what
o-o
we get now with
o-o
plurality.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now are we done?
end-lyric
