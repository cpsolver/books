ambee put-into-phrase lyric-number 0580000 amenn

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
The picky
o-o
terminology
o-o
is another
o-o
reason we
o-o
don't teach
o-o
this stuff.
sentence-next
o-o
Except to some
o-o
graduate
o-o
students.
sentence-next
o-o
Mathematically
o-o
what makes more sense
o-o
is to use
o-o
the name
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
voting
o-o
to mean any
o-o
counting method
o-o
that uses
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that other
o-o
name important?
sentence-next
o-o
Transfer
o-o
something.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've already
o-o
learned the
o-o
basic concept.
sentence-next
o-o
It uses
o-o
ranked
o-o
choice ballots
o-o
to elect
o-o
two or more
o-o
winners
o-o
from the same
o-o
bigger district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the
o-o
proportional
o-o
representation
o-o
part,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Basically,
o-o
yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
too mind hyphen-here bending
o-o
for math hyphen-here phobic
o-o
voters
o-o
to swallow
o-o
and digest?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's a simple
o-o
combination
o-o
that would
o-o
pole vault us
o-o
almost as high
o-o
as the best
o-o
counting
o-o
methods.
sentence-next
o-o
We can simply
o-o
eliminate
o-o
pairwise losing
o-o
candidates,
o-o
and use
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting when
o-o
a counting round
o-o
doesn't have a
o-o
pairwise
o-o
losing
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How hard's it
o-o
to do that
o-o
pairwise
o-o
counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
All the counting
o-o
is done by computer.
sentence-next
o-o
So a mouse click
o-o
is all you need
o-o
in a real
o-o
election.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the
o-o
barrier against
o-o
using ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Up until a few
o-o
decades ago, when
o-o
computers came along,
o-o
doing the math by hand
o-o
was the big barrier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But now we have
o-o
computers, so
o-o
what's stopping us
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fear.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
a fear of math.
sentence-next
o-o
Officially
o-o
that's called
o-o
mathematical
o-o
anxiety.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of people
o-o
have it 'cause
o-o
most people
o-o
don't trust what
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Math
o-o
anxiety.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what I
o-o
was infected
o-o
by.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You're
o-o
disinfected
o-o
now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Already
o-o
the bleach scent
o-o
isn't evident.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Another
o-o
barrier
o-o
is that some
o-o
math experts claim
o-o
score ballots
o-o
are better than
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Those ballots
o-o
ask for ratings
o-o
instead of
o-o
rankings.
sentence-next
o-o
The grades
o-o
A through F
o-o
are ratings,
o-o
not rankings.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are score ballots
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They collect
o-o
more information.
sentence-next
o-o
However
o-o
they are
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to tactical
o-o
voting.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
the voter
o-o
indicates
o-o
the strength
o-o
of their
o-o
preferences.
sentence-next
o-o
Eventually
o-o
in the distant
o-o
future there
o-o
might be ways
o-o
to use those
o-o
ballots for
o-o
elections
o-o
that involve
o-o
multiple
o-o
winners.
sentence-next
o-o
But they
o-o
aren't fair
o-o
when electing
o-o
one winner
o-o
in a general
o-o
election.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
name-damien no-space ,
o-o
that means
o-o
that different
o-o
kind of ballot
o-o
isn't what
o-o
we need.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm
o-o
wonderin' why
o-o
awareness
o-o
of greater
o-o
fairness
o-o
doesn't
o-o
attract
o-o
voters like a
o-o
magnet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You are so
o-o
na&#239;ve.
sentence-next
o-o
Greedy folks
o-o
are in control
o-o
and they don't want
o-o
fairness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those of us
o-o
who are
o-o
workin' hard
o-o
yet sufferin'
o-o
want our fair share
o-o
of the
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And rich people
o-o
want to protect
o-o
their too hyphen-here big slice
o-o
of economic pie,
o-o
with vanilla
o-o
ice cream and
o-o
three cherries
o-o
on top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Speaking of
o-o
ice cream,
o-o
here are
o-o
colored blocks
o-o
that represent
o-o
ten ballots,
o-o
and the colors
o-o
represent
o-o
ice cream flavors.
end-lyric

<img width="500" height="165" src="ballots_four_flavors.jpg"/>
end-paragraph-centered

ambee sings-desha amenn
Pretty colors!
sentence-next
o-o
Which flavors?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Dark brown is
o-o
chocolate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yum!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pink is for
o-o
strawberry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not a fan
o-o
of pink.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This color
o-o
represents
o-o
mint chocolate
o-o
chip.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I presume
o-o
the last color
o-o
is vanilla.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's so special
o-o
about these ten
o-o
stacks of
o-o
colored blocks?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Each stack
o-o
represents
o-o
one ballot,
o-o
with the voter's
o-o
favorite
o-o
on top,
o-o
and least hyphen-here favorite
o-o
on bottom.
sentence-next
o-o
With these ten
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
the winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla,
o-o
depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As usual,
o-o
brown always
o-o
loses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
The counting
o-o
method
o-o
matters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
And yet,
o-o
almost any
o-o
method is better
o-o
than what we've
o-o
got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So now
o-o
do we know
o-o
all about voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And how math
o-o
can solve the
o-o
conflicts
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Another bit
o-o
you can learn
o-o
about later,
o-o
when you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
It will be
o-o
improvements
o-o
in how members
o-o
of Congress,
o-o
or a
o-o
parliament,
o-o
or a state
o-o
legislature,
o-o
will vote to
o-o
decide which
o-o
bills should pass
o-o
to become
o-o
laws.
sentence-next
o-o
But getting
o-o
that math right
o-o
is too advanced
o-o
for you now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
not giving
o-o
my drowning
o-o
birdbrain
o-o
a migraine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet you should know
o-o
that electing
o-o
city council
o-o
members
o-o
sometimes
o-o
doesn't involve
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
In that case
o-o
having three
o-o
councilors
o-o
from each district
o-o
is a good choice.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What does that
o-o
accomplish?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With the math
o-o
we've been
o-o
talking about,
o-o
if the winner
o-o
of the first seat
o-o
is backed by
o-o
lots of money
o-o
from business 
o-o
owners,
o-o
the second hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner will
o-o
represent
o-o
employees,
o-o
because they
o-o
outnumber
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
The third seat
o-o
is won by
o-o
whoever
o-o
is not well
o-o
represented
o-o
by the first two
o-o
winners.
sentence-next
o-o
That yields
o-o
representative
o-o
diversity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this protects
o-o
against
o-o
getting just
o-o
males,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It protects
o-o
against
o-o
excessive
o-o
influence
o-o
from campaign
o-o
contributions
o-o
that just come from
o-o
male hyphen-here dominated
o-o
origins.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
because it's
o-o
possible
o-o
a male
o-o
politician
o-o
better
o-o
represents
o-o
what women want.
sentence-next
o-o
Compared to
o-o
a female
o-o
politician
o-o
who's controlled
o-o
by male
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Finally!
sentence-next
o-o
Representation
o-o
for more women!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And hopefully
o-o
in a big city,
o-o
where there's
o-o
diversity,
o-o
at least one
o-o
minority
o-o
politician
o-o
will be
o-o
one of the three?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If that's what
o-o
at least
o-o
one third,
o-o
er,
o-o
enough
o-o
voters want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow.
sentence-next
o-o
Math is
o-o
magical!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Going back to
o-o
elections that
o-o
involve
o-o
political
o-o
parties,
o-o
if anyone claims
o-o
that four or five
o-o
seats per district
o-o
would be
o-o
better than two,
o-o
they're not
o-o
considering
o-o
how that would
o-o
interfere
o-o
with how
o-o
legislatures
o-o
vote on bills.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I got lost at
o-o
the beginning
o-o
of that
o-o
sentence.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
She's just saying
o-o
this new info
o-o
doesn't
o-o
contradict
o-o
what she said
o-o
earlier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now are we done?
end-lyric
