ambee sings-desha amenn
So how is the
o-o
second seat filled?
sentence-next
o-o
In a way that's fair.
sentence-next
o-o
For the sheep,
o-o
and goats,
o-o
and pigs?
sentence-next
o-o
Or maybe I should say,
o-o
for women to get
o-o
the representation
o-o
we deserve.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Using simple math,
o-o
a computer can
o-o
calculate which
o-o
voters are 
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
by the first hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since that math
o-o
is simple,
o-o
I don't need to
o-o
hear about it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Except to know
o-o
it involves
o-o
division.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sweet!
sentence-next
o-o
Divide and
o-o
conquer!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The ballots
o-o
of those
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
voters
o-o
would have their
o-o
influence
o-o
greatly reduced.
sentence-next
o-o
Often all the
o-o
way to zero.
sentence-next
o-o
The remaining
o-o
voters still have
o-o
full influence
o-o
for their ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
is done again,
o-o
and the most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
wins the
o-o
second seat.
sentence-next
o-o
In this
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Suppose the
o-o
Republican
o-o
party only
o-o
offers puppet
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
and the Democratic
o-o
party offers
o-o
anti hyphen-here corruption
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Barack
o-o
and Hypatia,
o-o
then both winners
o-o
could be Democrats?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
More likely
o-o
both parties
o-o
will offer
o-o
good candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
Then typically
o-o
one Republican
o-o
and one Democrat
o-o
will represent
o-o
each district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much
o-o
better than now.
sentence-next
o-o
We pretend
o-o
one Republican
o-o
or one Democrat
o-o
can represent
o-o
most voters
o-o
in a district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But if every district
o-o
elects one
o-o
Republican and
o-o
one Democrat,
o-o
then Congress
o-o
would be tied.
sentence-next
o-o
That's cockeyed.
sentence-next
o-o
The population
o-o
is not
o-o
evenly
o-o
divided
o-o
between the
o-o
two parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To fix that
o-o
unfair balance,
o-o
we make the
o-o
districts a little
o-o
bigger.
sentence-next
o-o
And we reserve
o-o
a few special
o-o
seats.
sentence-next
o-o
These are called
o-o
statewide seats.
sentence-next
o-o
We can measure
o-o
party popularity
o-o
throughout
o-o
the state
o-o
to determine
o-o
which party
o-o
deserves to win
o-o
each statewide
o-o
seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Allowing party
o-o
insiders
o-o
to choose
o-o
whose butts
o-o
will fill
o-o
those seats?
sentence-next
o-o
That seems
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Lots of
o-o
European
o-o
nations
o-o
do it that way.
sentence-next
o-o
But you're right.
sentence-next
o-o
It's not fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why are those
o-o
voters so
o-o
stupid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people
o-o
in power
o-o
are the ones who
o-o
have to approve
o-o
any change.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
The members of
o-o
parliament
o-o
only embrace
o-o
a change if it's
o-o
likely to get
o-o
themselves
o-o
re hyphen-here elected.
sentence-next
o-o
Otherwise it
o-o
would be as
o-o
unlikely as
o-o
turkeys voting
o-o
in favor of
o-o
Thanksgiving.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another barrier!
sentence-next
o-o
Political
o-o
turkeys.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Far fairer is
o-o
to look at the
o-o
ballots again.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we
o-o
identify the
o-o
most popular
o-o
of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
will fill that
o-o
party's
o-o
statewide seat.
sentence-next
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each
o-o
statewide seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How can we
o-o
measure party
o-o
popularity?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
We can add a
o-o
ballot question.
sentence-next
o-o
It would ask
o-o
voters to rank
o-o
the parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting for parties?
sentence-next
o-o
That seems strange.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's what lots of
o-o
people in lots
o-o
of nations do
o-o
on their ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Although not yet
o-o
using ranked
o-o
choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
That information
o-o
about party
o-o
popularity
o-o
also enables
o-o
us to limit
o-o
the number of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from each party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hopefully
o-o
that limit
o-o
does not involve
o-o
discrimination,
o-o
a glass ceiling,
o-o
or a glass slipper.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If the method
o-o
is well hyphen-here designed,
o-o
the results
o-o
are fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Very unpopular
o-o
parties would get
o-o
excluded,
o-o
right?
sentence-next
o-o
So their
o-o
candidates
o-o
don't waste space
o-o
on the ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yet big
o-o
third parties
o-o
would get
o-o
at least one
o-o
candidate
o-o
each,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
That allows a
o-o
third party
o-o
to grow and
o-o
maybe overtake
o-o
a big party.
sentence-next
o-o
That's how
o-o
elections
o-o
used to work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
sentence-next
o-o
Competition!
sentence-next
o-o
I hope I live
o-o
to see the
o-o
Republican
o-o
and Democratic
o-o
parties
o-o
obliterated!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't like names,
o-o
but this is
o-o
getting
o-o
complex.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there a name
o-o
for all of
o-o
this mess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It is
o-o
sort of like
o-o
a jigsaw puzzle
o-o
with lots of
o-o
pieces.
sentence-next
o-o
And different
o-o
pieces
o-o
would work.
sentence-next
o-o
And they have lots
o-o
of names.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet the method
o-o
that reaches
o-o
farthest toward
o-o
what I've described
o-o
is called
o-o
VoteFair ranking.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
VoteFair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
I've heard about
o-o
FairVote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
VoteFair
o-o
is an
o-o
election
o-o
system I like.
sentence-next
o-o
FairVote is an
o-o
organization
o-o
that promotes
o-o
two different
o-o
counting
o-o
methods,
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting and
o-o
something called
o-o
the single
o-o
transferable
o-o
vote.
sentence-next
o-o
But they use
o-o
the name
o-o
begin-italics ranked choice
o-o
voting end-italics
o-o
to cover
o-o
both methods.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's
o-o
overwhelmingly
o-o
confusing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
The picky
o-o
terminology
o-o
is part of why
o-o
we only teach
o-o
this stuff
o-o
to graduate
o-o
students.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
the name
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
begin-italics voting end-italics
o-o
has come to mean
o-o
just about
o-o
any method
o-o
that counts
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
begin-italics ballots end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that other
o-o
name important?
sentence-next
o-o
Transfer
o-o
something.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've already
o-o
learned the
o-o
basic concept.
sentence-next
o-o
That name
o-o
just refers to
o-o
some specific
o-o
math details
o-o
about using
o-o
ranked
o-o
choice ballots
o-o
to elect
o-o
two or more
o-o
winners
o-o
from the same
o-o
bigger district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the
o-o
proportional
o-o
representation
o-o
part,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's just part of
o-o
proportional
o-o
representation.
sentence-next
o-o
It's the part where
o-o
two or more
o-o
politicians
o-o
represent
o-o
the same larger
o-o
district.
sentence-next
o-o
The other part of
o-o
proportional
o-o
representation
o-o
is the use of
o-o
party hyphen-here based
o-o
statewide
o-o
seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Filling Congress
o-o
in a way
o-o
that's fair
o-o
is making sense.
sentence-next
o-o
So now
o-o
do we know
o-o
all about voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And how math
o-o
can solve the
o-o
conflicts
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Another bit
o-o
you can learn
o-o
about later,
o-o
when you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
It will be
o-o
improvements
o-o
in how members
o-o
of Congress,
o-o
or a
o-o
parliament,
o-o
or a state
o-o
legislature,
o-o
will vote to
o-o
decide which
o-o
bills should pass
o-o
to become
o-o
laws.
sentence-next
o-o
The same voting
o-o
would improve
o-o
how parliaments
o-o
choose
o-o
cabinet
o-o
ministers,
o-o
including the
o-o
prime minister.
sentence-next
o-o
And that
o-o
innovation
o-o
might help
o-o
reduce conflict
o-o
in the
o-o
Middle East.
sentence-next
o-o
But getting
o-o
that math right
o-o
is much
o-o
too advanced
o-o
for you now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
not giving
o-o
my melting
o-o
brain
o-o
a migraine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet you should know
o-o
that electing
o-o
city council
o-o
members
o-o
sometimes
o-o
doesn't involve
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
In those cities,
o-o
party hyphen-here based
o-o
citywide seats
o-o
don't make sense.
sentence-next
o-o
So each district
o-o
in the city
o-o
should have three
o-o
councilors,
o-o
not two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What does three seats
o-o
per district
o-o
accomplish?
end-lyric
