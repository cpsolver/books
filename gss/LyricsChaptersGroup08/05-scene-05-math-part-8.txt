ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
The picky
o-o
terminology
o-o
is another
o-o
reason we
o-o
don't teach
o-o
this stuff.
sentence-next
o-o
Except to some
o-o
graduate
o-o
students.
sentence-next
o-o
Mathematically
o-o
what makes more sense
o-o
is to use
o-o
the name
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
voting
o-o
to mean any
o-o
counting method
o-o
that uses
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that other
o-o
name important?
sentence-next
o-o
Transfer
o-o
something.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've already
o-o
learned the
o-o
basic concept.
sentence-next
o-o
That name
o-o
just refers to
o-o
some specific
o-o
math details
o-o
about using
o-o
ranked
o-o
choice ballots
o-o
to elect
o-o
two or more
o-o
winners
o-o
from the same
o-o
bigger district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the
o-o
proportional
o-o
representation
o-o
part,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's the part
o-o
where two or more
o-o
politicians
o-o
represent
o-o
the same larger
o-o
district.
sentence-next
o-o
The statewide seats
o-o
also are needed
o-o
to yield
o-o
fully
o-o
proportional
o-o
results.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
too mind hyphen-here bending
o-o
for math hyphen-here phobic
o-o
voters
o-o
to swallow
o-o
and digest?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The ballots
o-o
can be counted
o-o
by hand
o-o
when an
o-o
official
o-o
recount
o-o
is needed.
sentence-next
o-o
Or as a
o-o
demonstration
o-o
of what happens
o-o
inside a
o-o
computer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
At the risk
o-o
of gagging
o-o
on a furball,
o-o
how would that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's say there's
o-o
uncertainty
o-o
about which of
o-o
the top four
o-o
candidates
o-o
really won.
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine
o-o
six people
o-o
sitting at a
o-o
long table
o-o
and doing
o-o
the counting.
sentence-next
o-o
Each counter
o-o
looks at each
o-o
ballot,
o-o
does a tally
o-o
for just one
o-o
specific
o-o
pair of
o-o
candidates,
o-o
and passes it
o-o
to the next
o-o
counter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If you were
o-o
counting,
o-o
and your pair
o-o
were Hypatia
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
you'd look at which
o-o
of those two
o-o
was ranked higher
o-o
or lower
o-o
than the other.
sentence-next
o-o
And you'd press
o-o
a button
o-o
on one of three
o-o
mechanical
o-o
counters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
When the counting
o-o
is done,
o-o
watchers
o-o
look at
o-o
the mechanical
o-o
counters
o-o
to see who won
o-o
each
o-o
pairwise
o-o
contest.
sentence-next
o-o
That pairwise
o-o
counting process
o-o
only needs to
o-o
be done once.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You said sometimes
o-o
there's no
o-o
pairwise losing
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
What happens then?
sentence-next
o-o
For counting
o-o
by hand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's say that
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
is used
o-o
to choose
o-o
which candidate
o-o
to eliminate
o-o
when there's
o-o
no pairwise
o-o
losing candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
Then one person
o-o
can sort the
o-o
paper ballots
o-o
into piles
o-o
according
o-o
to which of the
o-o
remaining
o-o
candidates
o-o
is highest
o-o
ranked on
o-o
each ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
The pile
o-o
with the fewest
o-o
ballots
o-o
identifies
o-o
which candidate
o-o
to eliminate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that
o-o
combination
o-o
method
o-o
good enough
o-o
for real
o-o
elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
It pole vaults us
o-o
almost as high
o-o
as the best
o-o
counting
o-o
methods.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's its name?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Election
o-o
methods
o-o
are like
o-o
food recipies.
sentence-next
o-o
Switching an
o-o
ingredient
o-o
or two
o-o
can cause it 
o-o
to fail.
sentence-next
o-o
Even if the name
o-o
remains the same.
sentence-next
o-o
Basically
o-o
this is instant
o-o
runoff voting
o-o
with pairwise
o-o
eliminations,
o-o
plus correctly
o-o
counting
o-o
so hyphen-here called
o-o
overvotes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the
o-o
barrier
o-o
against using
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Up until a few
o-o
decades ago,
o-o
when computers
o-o
came along,
o-o
doing the math
o-o
by hand
o-o
was the big
o-o
barrier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But now we have
o-o
computers,
o-o
so what's
o-o
stopping us
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fear.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
a fear of math.
sentence-next
o-o
Officially
o-o
that's called
o-o
mathematical
o-o
anxiety.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of people
o-o
have it 'cause
o-o
most people
o-o
don't trust what
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Math
o-o
anxiety.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what I
o-o
was infected
o-o
by.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You're
o-o
disinfected
o-o
now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Already
o-o
the bleach scent
o-o
isn't evident.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Another
o-o
barrier
o-o
is that
o-o
lots of money
o-o
is given to
o-o
organizations
o-o
that criticize
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
voting.
sentence-next
o-o
Those critics
o-o
claim that
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
are difficult
o-o
for voters
o-o
to mark.
sentence-next
o-o
As evidence,
o-o
those critics
o-o
point to
o-o
historical
o-o
elections
o-o
where so hyphen-here called
o-o
overvotes
o-o
were interpreted
o-o
as voter
o-o
confusion.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course
o-o
the critics
o-o
neglect to mention
o-o
that a software
o-o
upgrade can
o-o
correctly
o-o
count those marks.
sentence-next
o-o
The two failures
o-o
in Burlington
o-o
and Alaska
o-o
are brought up
o-o
without
o-o
mentioning
o-o
those failures
o-o
are easy
o-o
to avoid
o-o
by eliminating
o-o
pairwise
o-o
losing
o-o
candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
And some
o-o
money hyphen-here backed
o-o
organizations
o-o
claim that
o-o
score ballots
o-o
are better than
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are score ballots
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Among friends,
o-o
where honesty
o-o
can be monitored,
o-o
score ballots
o-o
collect useful
o-o
information
o-o
about a voter's
o-o
strength of
o-o
preference.
sentence-next
o-o
But they don't work
o-o
in general
o-o
elections
o-o
for governors,
o-o
presidents,
o-o
and mayors.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
score ballots are
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to voters who
o-o
exaggerate.
sentence-next
o-o
Similar to
o-o
the clapping
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Drama queens
o-o
already get
o-o
too much
o-o
attention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm seeing that
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots are
o-o
great,
o-o
but the counting
o-o
method matters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here's a way
o-o
to see why.
sentence-next
o-o
These colored blocks
o-o
represent
o-o
ten ballots,
o-o
and the colors
o-o
represent
o-o
four
o-o
ice cream
o-o
flavors.
end-lyric

end-paragraph-centered

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's the point
o-o
of playing with
o-o
colored blocks?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Each stack
o-o
represents
o-o
one ranked choice
o-o
ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
The voter's
o-o
favorite
o-o
is on top.
sentence-next
o-o
Their least hyphen-here favorite
o-o
is on the
o-o
bottom.
sentence-next
o-o
The winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla,
o-o
depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As usual,
o-o
brown always
o-o
loses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
plurality voting,
o-o
what we use now,
o-o
just looks down
o-o
on the blocks
o-o
from the top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Instant runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
also looks at
o-o
the top blocks.
sentence-next
o-o
But then
o-o
the color
o-o
that appears
o-o
to be least
o-o
popular
o-o
is removed.
sentence-next
o-o
That repeats
o-o
until one
o-o
color remains.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm guessing
o-o
pairwise counting
o-o
is the third
o-o
counting method?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
looks deeply
o-o
into all the
o-o
preference
o-o
information.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So now
o-o
do we know
o-o
all about voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And how math
o-o
can solve the
o-o
conflicts
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Another bit
o-o
you can learn
o-o
about later,
o-o
when you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
It will be
o-o
improvements
o-o
in how members
o-o
of Congress,
o-o
or a
o-o
parliament,
o-o
or a state
o-o
legislature,
o-o
will vote to
o-o
decide which
o-o
bills should pass
o-o
to become
o-o
laws.
sentence-next
o-o
But getting
o-o
that math right
o-o
is too advanced
o-o
for you now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
not giving
o-o
my drowning
o-o
birdbrain
o-o
a migraine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet you should know
o-o
that electing
o-o
city council
o-o
members
o-o
sometimes
o-o
doesn't involve
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
In that case
o-o
having three
o-o
councilors
o-o
from each district
o-o
is a good choice.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What does that
o-o
accomplish?
end-lyric
