With the math
o-o
we've been
o-o
talking about,
o-o
if the winner
o-o
of the first seat
o-o
is backed by
o-o
lots of money
o-o
from business 
o-o
owners,
o-o
the second hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner will
o-o
represent
o-o
employees and
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
Because they
o-o
greatly
o-o
outnumber
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
The third seat
o-o
is won by
o-o
whoever
o-o
is not well
o-o
represented
o-o
by the first two
o-o
winners.
sentence-next
o-o
That yields
o-o
representative
o-o
diversity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Does that
o-o
include
o-o
gender
o-o
diversity?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
And any other
o-o
kind of diversity.
sentence-next
o-o
Because
o-o
mathematics
o-o
is unbiased.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Finally!
sentence-next
o-o
Representation
o-o
for more women!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you don't
o-o
mind hearing a
o-o
percentage,
o-o
this counting
o-o
guarantees
o-o
representation
o-o
for at least
o-o
sixty six
o-o
percent of
o-o
voters.
sentence-next
o-o
That's much much
o-o
better than
o-o
no guarantee,
o-o
which is what
o-o
we get now with
o-o
plurality.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow.
sentence-next
o-o
Math is
o-o
magical!
sentence-next
o-o
Also it's
o-o
melting my brain.
sentence-next
o-o
So are we done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You haven't yet
o-o
told us how
o-o
to solve the
o-o
gerrymander
o-o
problem.
sentence-next
o-o
How do we avoid
o-o
a district shape
o-o
that looks like a
o-o
balloon animal
o-o
contorted by a
o-o
drunk lawyer?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The statewide seats
o-o
take care of that.
sentence-next
o-o
If a greedy
o-o
political
o-o
party chooses
o-o
biased district
o-o
boundaries,
o-o
the other parties
o-o
win all the
o-o
statewide
o-o
seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a slick
o-o
trick!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's not a trick.
sentence-next
o-o
It's math,
o-o
which can seem
o-o
magical
o-o
to those who
o-o
don't bother
o-o
to learn it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
So now,
o-o
let's suppose
o-o
that elections
o-o
become fair.
sentence-next
o-o
What will change,
o-o
politically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
especially
o-o
for the
o-o
unfortunate
o-o
poor.
sentence-next
o-o
And us college
o-o
grads who failed
o-o
to get to
o-o
the middle
o-o
class.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The answer to that
o-o
I don't know.
sentence-next
o-o
For that you need
o-o
to ask someone
o-o
who understands both
o-o
economics and
o-o
game theory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Video game
o-o
strategy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Game theory
o-o
is an
o-o
academic
o-o
field that
o-o
studies,
o-o
well,
o-o
it's difficult to
o-o
describe.
sentence-next
o-o
But it includes
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
I do know someone
o-o
with those credentials.
sentence-next
o-o
But he's at a
o-o
university
o-o
that's a three hyphen-here hour
o-o
drive away.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do you think he'd
o-o
give us a peek
o-o
into that
o-o
future?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I can ask him
o-o
by email.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be super!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He studies,
o-o
and teaches about,
o-o
economic history.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the study
o-o
of economies
o-o
during earlier
o-o
times.
sentence-next
o-o
Don't confuse it
o-o
with the history
o-o
of economics,
o-o
which is as boring
o-o
as it sounds.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I hate
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
As much as
o-o
I did
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This professor
o-o
can make
o-o
history fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm done
o-o
with the past.
sentence-next
o-o
It's gone.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do people
o-o
dwell on that
o-o
old stuffy
o-o
stuff?
sentence-next
o-o
And economics,
o-o
that's more math.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You seemed to
o-o
understand
o-o
a bit of
o-o
history
o-o
about
o-o
mathematics.
sentence-next
o-o
As for math in
o-o
economics,
o-o
it's just different
o-o
names for money
o-o
categories.
sentence-next
o-o
Like tax, debt,
o-o
interest,
o-o
subsidies,
o-o
and tariffs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Don't forget
o-o
bribes,
o-o
kickbacks,
o-o
and
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And you might
o-o
hear about more
o-o
percentages.
sentence-next
o-o
That just means
o-o
moving the
o-o
decimal point
o-o
right by
o-o
two places.
sentence-next
o-o
To make numbers
o-o
between
o-o
one and zero
o-o
easier to
o-o
comprehend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
For the
o-o
history part,
o-o
just think of it
o-o
as ziplining
o-o
in a time
o-o
machine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Going back to
o-o
the beginning
o-o
of today's meeting,
o-o
why did you make
o-o
a big deal
o-o
out of the
o-o
digit zero?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It took our
o-o
ancestors
o-o
centuries
o-o
to make the leap
o-o
from the abacus
o-o
in China
o-o
to the digits
o-o
zero through nine.
sentence-next
o-o
That's an
o-o
example from
o-o
history that
o-o
demonstrates
o-o
the power of
o-o
mathematics
o-o
to dramatically
o-o
improve
o-o
civilization.
sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
was known
o-o
centuries
o-o
before Condorcet,
o-o
who died in
o-o
the French
o-o
Revolution.
sentence-next
o-o
Humans in the
o-o
distant future
o-o
will marvel that
o-o
it's taking us
o-o
sooo long
o-o
to adopt a
o-o
well hyphen-here designed
o-o
election system.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So just like we
o-o
don't know what
o-o
we've got til
o-o
it's gone,
o-o
we don't really
o-o
know what's missing
o-o
until it can be
o-o
seen in
o-o
hindsight?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a wise
o-o
insight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of which,
o-o
we've learned about
o-o
ranked choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
And pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
And two seats
o-o
per district
o-o
plus statewide
o-o
seats for
o-o
Congress.
sentence-next
o-o
Will that stomp out
o-o
corruption
o-o
in Congress?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've aced
o-o
this course!
sentence-next
o-o
How politics
o-o
will change
o-o
I don't know.
sentence-next
o-o
That's not
o-o
my expertise.
end-lyric

name-mathprof no-space ,
o-o
thank you for

guiding us
o-o
through a
o-o
dark long cave
o-o
to a rich

treasure chest.
sentence-next
o-o
We'll share
o-o
what we've
o-o
learned.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember your
o-o
promise.
sentence-next
o-o
That you won't
o-o
reveal where
o-o
they came from.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Okay,
o-o
but why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I've got tenure,
o-o
so I'm not going
o-o
to lose my job.
sentence-next
o-o
But lots of
o-o
the grants for my
o-o
research projects
o-o
come from the
o-o
government.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When we bite the hand
o-o
that feeds you
o-o
we won't reveal
o-o
who took us off
o-o
our leashes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We can say we
o-o
learned it from
o-o
Wikipedia.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only bits of it
o-o
are in Wikipedia.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
they require
o-o
academic
o-o
references.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
for
o-o
mathematical
o-o
topics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I suppose
o-o
those references
o-o
don't exist because
o-o
governments
o-o
don't fund such
o-o
research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is all seeming
o-o
like a giant
o-o
conspiracy.
sentence-next
o-o
Except it's
o-o
in plain view.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's hidden
o-o
behind the
o-o
curtain of
o-o
mathematics.
sentence-next
o-o
Under the
o-o
unmarked
o-o
trap door
o-o
of plurality
o-o
vote counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Fear of math
o-o
keeps it

well hidden.
