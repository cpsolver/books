One more tip.
sentence-next
o-o
There's something
o-o
called begin-italics mathiness end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
It's a misuse of
o-o
mathematics.
sentence-next
o-o
Math doesn't lie,
o-o
but some liars
o-o
use numbers
o-o
when they lie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Mathiness
o-o
must be what

my landlord's
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I admit I tend
o-o
to distrust math
o-o
until I do the
o-o
counting or
o-o
calculations
o-o
myself.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So, we've
o-o
learned that
o-o
ranked choice ballots
o-o
and
o-o
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
is the key
o-o
to less corruption,
o-o
in Washington
o-o
DC.
sentence-next
o-o
But do we need
o-o
to remember
o-o
that guy's name?
sentence-next
o-o
Condolences,
o-o
or something?

Condorcet

sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
includes
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
methods,
o-o
and some
o-o
non hyphen-here Condorcet
o-o
methods.
sentence-next
o-o
So just remember
o-o
the concept of
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
And needing more
o-o
than half those votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Half's a fraction
o-o
I can recall.
sentence-next
o-o
But I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
why you made a
o-o
big deal out of
o-o
the digit
o-o
zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Zero as a digit
o-o
changed the world
o-o
in marvelous ways.
sentence-next
o-o
Similarly
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
will change the world
o-o
in marvelous ways.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet it took our
o-o
ancestors
o-o
centuries
o-o
to make the leap
o-o
from the abacus
o-o
in China
o-o
to what we see
o-o
as obvious,
o-o
the benefits
o-o
of the digits
o-o
zero through nine.
sentence-next
o-o
And more
o-o
centuries
o-o
passed as the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
traveled
o-o
along the
o-o
silk road
o-o
through Muslims
o-o
in the
o-o
Middle East,
o-o
then to
o-o
northern
o-o
Africa,
o-o
then to a
o-o
future Pope
o-o
who overturned
o-o
the previous
o-o
belief
o-o
that using them
o-o
was a sin.
sentence-next
o-o
In a similar way
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
was known
o-o
centuries
o-o
before Condorcet,
o-o
who died
o-o
in the French
o-o
Revolution.
sentence-next
o-o
Humans in the
o-o
distant future
o-o
will marvel that
o-o
it took us
o-o
sooo long
o-o
to adopt a
o-o
well hyphen-here designed
o-o
election system
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So just like we
o-o
don't know what
o-o
we've got til
o-o
it's gone,
o-o
we don't really
o-o
know what's missing
o-o
until it can be
o-o
seen in
o-o
hindsight?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a wise
o-o
insight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I was right.
sentence-next
o-o
You begin-italics are end-italics
o-o
very bright.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's just
o-o
common sense.
sentence-next
o-o
But what you've
o-o
taught us
o-o
are hidden
o-o
secrets.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones those
o-o

sentence-next
o-o
We're grateful
o-o
you've guided
o-o
us through a
o-o
dark long cave
o-o
to a rich
o-o
treasure chest.
sentence-next
o-o
We'll share
o-o
what we've
o-o
learned.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember your
o-o
promise,
o-o
...
o-o
that you won't
o-o
reveal where
o-o
they came from.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, but why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I've got tenure,
o-o
so I'm not likely
o-o
to lose my job.
sentence-next
o-o
But I can
o-o
lose grants for
o-o
my research projects.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Some of your
o-o
funds come from the
o-o
government?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes. Lots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When we bite the hand
o-o
that feeds you
o-o
we won't reveal
o-o
who took us off
o-o
our leashes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We can say we
o-o
learned it from
o-o
Wikipedia.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only bits of it
o-o
are in Wikipedia.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
they require
o-o
academic
o-o
references,
o-o
especially
o-o
for
o-o
mathematical
o-o
topics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I suppose
o-o
those references
o-o
don't exist because
o-o
governments
o-o
don't fund such
o-o
research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is all seeming
o-o
like a giant
o-o
conspiracy,
o-o
except that it's
o-o
in plain view.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's hidden
o-o
behind the
o-o
curtain of
o-o
mathematics,
o-o
under the
o-o
unmarked
o-o
trap door
o-o
of pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Fear of math
o-o
keeps it well hidden.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This makes it
o-o
all the more special
o-o
that you've taken
o-o
the time to explain
o-o
this to us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm extremely
o-o
grateful.
sentence-next
o-o
You've given me,
o-o
us, more than I
o-o
could ever have
o-o
hoped for.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I love these kinds
o-o
of conversations.
sentence-next
o-o
I wish textbooks
o-o
and those dang
o-o
standardized
o-o
tests would allow
o-o
me to teach more
o-o
like this,
o-o
without as much
o-o
notation
o-o
and terminology.
sentence-next
o-o
The joy of math
o-o
is in the concepts.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what counts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I'm
o-o
beginning to see
o-o
a begin-italics fraction end-italics of
o-o
that joy in
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
one more thing.
sentence-next
o-o
Since pairwise counting
o-o
is a few years off,
o-o
what can we do
o-o
in the next
o-o
election
o-o
to fight against
o-o
vote splitting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Tell your friends,
o-o
including the
o-o
ones online,
o-o
that the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot,
o-o
what we use now,
o-o
is not asking
o-o
begin-italics who is your favorite? end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what's it
o-o
asking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Besides
o-o
which loser
o-o
do you want
o-o
to get stuck
o-o
with?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There is no
o-o
easy way
o-o
to say
o-o
what it's
o-o
asking.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's no way
o-o
to mark a
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot to say
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
And choosing
o-o
not to vote
o-o
does not express
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Instead a
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot invites
o-o
tactical
o-o
voting,
o-o
as if the voter
o-o
is choosing
o-o
which army
o-o
to fight with.
sentence-next
o-o
Choosing to join
o-o
a small army
o-o
that will lose
o-o
makes it easier
o-o
for the biggest
o-o
army
o-o
to destroy
o-o
a large army
o-o
you like
o-o
more than
o-o
the biggest
o-o
army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But that means
o-o
never voting
o-o
for a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
No.
sentence-next
o-o
If none of the
o-o
opposition
o-o
candidates
o-o
has a chance
o-o
of winning
o-o
against the one
o-o
you most dislike,
o-o
you can mark your
o-o
favorite
o-o
opposition
o-o
candidate,
o-o
which can be
o-o
a third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So in the next
o-o
presidential
o-o
election,
o-o
if the incumbent
o-o
will easily
o-o
get re hyphen-here elected,
o-o
I can vote
o-o
for a third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's an
o-o
important
o-o
exception
o-o
because of three
o-o
complications.
sentence-next
o-o
The number gap
o-o
between the
o-o
Republican
o-o
and Democrat
o-o
is put under
o-o
a microscope,
o-o
the
o-o
electoral
o-o
vote count
o-o
matters too,
o-o
and the House
o-o
of Representatives
o-o
gets to choose
o-o
who wins if
o-o
neither candidate
o-o
gets half the
o-o
electoral votes.
