With the math
o-o
we've been
o-o
talking about,
o-o
if the winner
o-o
of the first seat
o-o
is backed by
o-o
lots of money
o-o
from business 
o-o
owners,
o-o
the second hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner will
o-o
represent
o-o
employees,
o-o
because they
o-o
outnumber
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
The third seat
o-o
is won by
o-o
whoever
o-o
is not well
o-o
represented
o-o
by the first two
o-o
winners.
sentence-next
o-o
That yields
o-o
representative
o-o
diversity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this protects
o-o
against
o-o
getting just
o-o
males,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If that's
o-o
important
o-o
politically,
o-o
yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Finally!
sentence-next
o-o
Representation
o-o
for more women!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How about
o-o
minorities?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If that's what
o-o
enough
o-o
voters want,
o-o
then yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow.
sentence-next
o-o
Math is
o-o
magical!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you don't
o-o
mind hearing a
o-o
percentage,
o-o
this counting
o-o
guarantees
o-o
representation
o-o
for at least
o-o
sixty six
o-o
percent of
o-o
voters.
sentence-next
o-o
That's much much
o-o
better than
o-o
no guarantee,
o-o
which is what
o-o
we get now with
o-o
plurality.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My ears don't hurt.
sentence-next
o-o
But my brain
o-o
is melting.
sentence-next
o-o
Are we done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute.
sentence-next
o-o
You haven't
o-o
told us how
o-o
to solve the
o-o
gerrymander
o-o
problem.
sentence-next
o-o
How do we avoid
o-o
a district shape
o-o
that looks like a
o-o
balloon animal
o-o
contorted by a
o-o
drunk lawyer?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The statewide seats
o-o
take care of that.
sentence-next
o-o
If a greedy
o-o
political
o-o
party chooses
o-o
biased district
o-o
boundaries,
o-o
the other parties
o-o
win all the
o-o
statewide
o-o
seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a slick
o-o
trick!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's not a trick.
sentence-next
o-o
It's math,
o-o
which can seem
o-o
magical
o-o
to those who
o-o
don't bother
o-o
to learn it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
So now,
o-o
let's suppose
o-o
that elections
o-o
become fair.
sentence-next
o-o
What will change,
o-o
politically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
especially
o-o
for the
o-o
unfortunate
o-o
poor.
sentence-next
o-o
And us college
o-o
grads who failed
o-o
to get to
o-o
the middle
o-o
class.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The answer to that
o-o
I don't know.
sentence-next
o-o
For that you need
o-o
to ask someone
o-o
who understands both
o-o
economics and
o-o
game theory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Video game
o-o
strategy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Game theory
o-o
is an
o-o
academic
o-o
field that
o-o
studies,
o-o
well,
o-o
it's difficult to
o-o
describe.
sentence-next
o-o
But it includes
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
I do know someone
o-o
with those credentials.
sentence-next
o-o
But he's at a
o-o
university
o-o
that's a three hyphen-here hour
o-o
drive away.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do you think he'd
o-o
give us a peek
o-o
into that
o-o
future?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I can ask him
o-o
by email.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be super!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He studies,
o-o
and teaches about,
o-o
economic history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The history
o-o
of economics?
sentence-next
o-o
That sounds like
o-o
a snooze fest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The history
o-o
of economics
o-o
is indeed boring.
sentence-next
o-o
For everyone.
sentence-next
o-o
Even econ
o-o
majors.
sentence-next
o-o
But that's
o-o
different from 
o-o
economic
o-o
history,
o-o
which is what
o-o
he teaches.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the study
o-o
of economies
o-o
during earlier
o-o
times.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I hate
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
As much as
o-o
I did
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This professor
o-o
can make
o-o
history fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm done
o-o
with the past.
sentence-next
o-o
It's gone.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do people
o-o
dwell on that
o-o
old stuffy
o-o
stuff?
sentence-next
o-o
'N economics,
o-o
that's more math.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You seemed to
o-o
understand
o-o
a bit of
o-o
history
o-o
about
o-o
mathematics.
sentence-next
o-o
As for math in
o-o
economics,
o-o
it's just different
o-o
names for money
o-o
categories.
sentence-next
o-o
Like tax, debt,
o-o
interest,
o-o
subsidies,
o-o
and tariffs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Don't forget
o-o
bribes,
o-o
kickbacks,
o-o
and
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And you might
o-o
hear about more
o-o
percentages.
sentence-next
o-o
That just means
o-o
moving the
o-o
decimal point
o-o
right by
o-o
two places,
o-o
to make numbers
o-o
between
o-o
one and zero
o-o
easier to

comprehend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You can

handle it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm a dummy
o-o
but I'll
o-o
try.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
One more tip.
sentence-next
o-o
There's something
o-o
called begin-italics mathiness end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
It's a misuse of
o-o
mathematics.
sentence-next
o-o
Math doesn't lie,
o-o
but some liars
o-o
use numbers
o-o
when they lie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Mathiness
o-o
must be what
o-o
my landlord's
o-o
using

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I admit I tend
o-o
to distrust math
o-o
until I do the
o-o
counting or
o-o
calculations
o-o
myself.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So we've
o-o
learned about
o-o
ranked choice ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
And pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
And
o-o
two or three seats
o-o
per district.
sentence-next
o-o
And statewide
o-o
seats.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what will
o-o
stomp out
o-o
corruption
o-o
in Congress,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've aced
o-o
this course!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But do we need
o-o
to remember
o-o
that guy's name?
sentence-next
o-o
Condolences,
o-o
or something?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Condorcet
o-o
rhymes with

sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
includes
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
methods.
sentence-next
o-o
And some
o-o
non hyphen-here Condorcet
o-o
methods.
sentence-next
o-o
So just remember
o-o
the concept of
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
And needing more
o-o
than half those votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Half's a fraction
o-o
I can recall.
sentence-next
o-o
But I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
why you made a
o-o
big deal out of
o-o
the digit
o-o
zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Zero as a digit
o-o
changed the world
o-o
in marvelous ways.
sentence-next
o-o
Similarly
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
will change the world
o-o
in marvelous ways.
sentence-next
o-o
It took our
o-o
ancestors
o-o
centuries
o-o
to make the leap
o-o
from the abacus
o-o
in China
o-o
to what we see
o-o
as obvious,
o-o
the benefits
o-o
of the digits
o-o
zero through nine.
sentence-next
o-o
In a similar way
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
was known
o-o
centuries
o-o
before Condorcet,
o-o
who died in
o-o
the French
o-o
Revolution.
sentence-next
o-o
Humans in the
o-o
distant future
o-o
will marvel that
o-o
it took us
o-o
sooo long
o-o
to adopt a
o-o
well hyphen-here designed
o-o
election system.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So just like we
o-o
don't know what
o-o
we've got til
o-o
it's gone,
o-o
we don't really
o-o
know what's missing
o-o
until it can be

seen in

hindsight?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a wise

insight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I was right.
sentence-next
o-o
You begin-italics are end-italics

end-lyric

That's just

common sense.

OK, but why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I've got tenure,

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We can say we

learned it from
o-o
Wikipedia.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only bits of it

are in Wikipedia.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o

references.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
for
o-o
mathematical
o-o
topics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I suppose
o-o
those references

don't exist because
o-o
governments

don't fund such

research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is all seeming

like a giant

o-o
Except it's
