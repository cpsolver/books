name-mathprof no-space ,
o-o
we're extremely
o-o
grateful
o-o
you've explained
o-o
all this to us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You've given me,
o-o
us, more than I
o-o
could ever have
o-o
hoped for.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I love these kinds
o-o
of conversations.
sentence-next
o-o
I wish textbooks
o-o
and those dang
o-o
standardized
o-o
tests would allow
o-o
me to teach more
o-o
like this.
sentence-next
o-o
Without as much
o-o
notation
o-o
and terminology.
sentence-next
o-o
The joy of math
o-o
is in the concepts.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what counts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I'm
o-o
beginning to see
o-o
a begin-italics fraction end-italics of
o-o
that joy in
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
one more thing.
sentence-next
o-o
Since pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
is a few years off,
o-o
what can we do
o-o
in the next
o-o
election
o-o
to fight against
o-o
vote splitting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Tell your friends,
o-o
including the
o-o
ones online,
o-o
that the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot,
o-o
what we use now,
o-o
is not asking
o-o
begin-italics who is your favorite? end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what's it
o-o
asking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Besides
o-o
which loser
o-o
do you want
o-o
to get stuck
o-o
with?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There is no
o-o
easy way
o-o
to say
o-o
what it's
o-o
asking.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's no way
o-o
to mark a
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot to say
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
And choosing
o-o
not to vote
o-o
does not express
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Instead a
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot invites
o-o
tactical
o-o
voting.
sentence-next
o-o
As if the voter
o-o
is choosing
o-o
which army
o-o
to join,
o-o
and fight with.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
voting for a
o-o
candidate
o-o
who can't win
o-o
is like
o-o
choosing to join
o-o
a small army
o-o
that watches while
o-o
two big armies
o-o
clash
o-o
without you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But that means
o-o
never voting
o-o
for a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
No.
sentence-next
o-o
You and others
o-o
can mark a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate
o-o
without regret
o-o
if adding your
o-o
bayonets
o-o
to either
o-o
big army
o-o
can't possibly
o-o
change who wins.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So in the next
o-o
presidential
o-o
election,
o-o
if one of the two
o-o
will easily
o-o
get elected,
o-o
I can vote
o-o
for a third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Not there.
sentence-next
o-o
Third hyphen-here party voters
o-o
have been changing
o-o
who wins.
sentence-next
o-o
On top of that,
o-o
state hyphen-here by hyphen-here state
o-o
electoral
o-o
votes
o-o
matter too.
sentence-next
o-o
And the
o-o
nationwide
o-o
number gap
o-o
between the
o-o
Republican
o-o
and Democrat
o-o
is put under
o-o
a microscope.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Can we fix
o-o
presidential
o-o
elections?
sentence-next
o-o
In the good sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Without
o-o
amending the
o-o
Constitution?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I believe so.
sentence-next
o-o
But only if
o-o
first we use
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
vote counting in
o-o
begin-italics congressional end-italics
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
Then an
o-o
interstate
o-o
compact
o-o
probably
o-o
can correct the
o-o
electoral
o-o
college
o-o
mess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
There's already
o-o
an interstate
o-o
compact getting
o-o
adopted.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That one says
o-o
the winner is
o-o
the one with
o-o
the most votes.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you see
o-o
what that means?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's plurality
o-o
voting.
sentence-next
o-o
Yuck!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That can't handle
o-o
a second
o-o
Republican,
o-o
or a second
o-o
Democrat,
o-o
or even one
o-o
popular
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I suppose
o-o
until we get
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
we're stuck with
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
In the meantime,
o-o
the way to
o-o
help defeat
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is to pay
o-o
more attention
o-o
to primary
o-o
elections.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Republicans
o-o
always win here.
sentence-next
o-o
Maybe I should
o-o
register as
o-o
a Republican.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That will give you
o-o
influence
o-o
in the
o-o
primaries
o-o
that matter
o-o
here.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the best way
o-o
to express
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The best way
o-o
is to promote
o-o
ranked choice voting
o-o
in general
o-o
elections
o-o
as the first step
o-o
toward a
o-o
well hyphen-here designed
o-o
election system.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What should
o-o
our protest
o-o
signs say?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a foreign
o-o
world to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
begin-italics
Don't put your
o-o
ballot in the
o-o
shredder,
o-o
we can do better.
sentence-next
o-o
Candidates
o-o
should be
o-o
ranked!
end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We can work
o-o
that out
o-o
later.
sentence-next
o-o
name-mathprof no-space ,
o-o
you're a true
o-o
guru.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Thank you!
sentence-next
o-o
All of this has
o-o
been so
o-o
helpful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yes, thank you!
sentence-next
o-o
Especially,
o-o
thanks for
o-o
teaching me
o-o
my use of
o-o
fractions was
o-o
irrational.
sentence-next
o-o
And that I'm not
o-o
a third hyphen-here wit loser.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're welcome.
sentence-next
o-o
And name-damien no-space ,
o-o
your brain
o-o
does not contain
o-o
an unreal
o-o
number of
o-o
nonsensical
o-o
Tik Tok videos.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Admittedly
o-o
I just try to
o-o
avoid stupidity.
sentence-next
o-o
Thanks again
o-o
for your candid
o-o
clarity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With what
o-o
we have learned,
o-o
I'm ready
o-o
to avenge
o-o
the deaths
o-o
of my mother
o-o
and brother,
o-o
who were killed
o-o
by the corrupt.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's go
o-o
out to
o-o
obstruct
o-o
the
o-o
political
o-o
status quo!
