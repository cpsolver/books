<h1>Scene 5, Math Breakthrough</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De (Desha)<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500000 -->&#160;Hi Professor Mata.&#160; This is Damien.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M (Professor Mata)<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500001 -->&#160;Welcome Desha and Damien.&#160; Welcome to my classroom.&#160; As we get settled I'll ask you Damien, do you like pi?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D (Damien)<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500002 -->&#160;I'll keep things real.&#160; In the morning pie seems so irrational.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500003 -->&#160;So you do like math?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500004 -->&#160;Already I'm confused.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500005 -->&#160;He doesn't know about those special meanings for pi and irrational, and real, in the math world.&#160; Just assume he knows as much about math as Mozart knew about ... computers.&#160; Plus he has a phobia about fractions.&#160; That's Damien.&#160; I don't know if Mozart had that fear.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500006 -->&#160;Classrooms are scary, spooky, 'n terrifyin'.&#160; This one's bringin' back awful memories of bein' teased for gettin' Cs, 'n Ds, 'specially in math 'n history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500007 -->&#160;I bet you're smart.&#160; You just didn't get a good start.&#160; Let's start with magical zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500008 -->&#160;What's so special 'bout zero?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500009 -->&#160;Even more remarkable than the number zero is the <i>digit</i> zero.&#160; There have always been words like none, zilch, empty, vacant, nobody, naked, hungry, and moron.&#160; It's the digit zero that gave math a path away from Roman numerals.&#160; Now instead of writing X X X V I we write three six.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500010 -->&#160;Thank goodness!&#160; Otherwise our bridges would be filled with long lines of accountants.&#160; Waiting for their turn to jump off.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500011 -->&#160;When it was new, the digit zero guided Portuguese sailing ships to Brazil then around Africa to spice-growing islands using longitude calculations.&#160; Now it puts rovers on the planet Mars.&#160; And it prevents hair loss on election night.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500012 -->&#160;If we still used Roman numerals today I would have jumped to first in line at the nearest bridge.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500013 -->&#160;Do you appreciate that the digit zero allows us to quickly calculate?&#160; Without using the fractions you hate?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500014 -->&#160;How so?&#160; I've gotta use fractions every day.&#160; It makes me wacko to add 'n subtract those ...&#160; suckers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500015 -->&#160;If fractions you loathe, then this question I pose.&#160; Why do you use them?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500016 -->&#160;It's part of my job.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500017 -->&#160;Are you a musician?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500018 -->&#160;What's music got to do with fractions?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500019 -->&#160;Musicians cannot avoid fractions.&#160; They count by two, or three, or four, or six, or eight.&#160; But not by five or ten.&#160; Except, I suspect, for some geeky modern jazz.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500020 -->&#160;Now we know Mozart wasn't fraction phobic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500021 -->&#160;I build custom staircases.&#160; Tape measures are marked in halves, quarters, eighths, 'n sixteenths.&#160; Those effin' fractions.&#160; I'd murder those suckers if I knew where to aim.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500022 -->&#160;Use decimal numbers.&#160; That's what the rest of the world uses as part of the metric system.&#160; Except of course here in the states.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500023 -->&#160;I can't use metric units.&#160; That'd get me fired.&#160; Inches and feet are required.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500024 -->&#160;Decimal numbers work with inches too.&#160; Just get a tape measure with decimal markings for inches.&#160; Here, look at this ruler.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500025 -->&#160;Oh, it's marked with ten units per inch!&#160; When I measure I could write the numbers as tenths.&#160; Or hundredths.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500026 -->&#160;And adding and subtracting them is as easy as dollars and cents.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500027 -->&#160;This will elevate my joy when making staircases.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500028 -->&#160;Remember this.&#160; A fraction is just a division problem unfinished.&#160; It's waiting to get diminished to a single number.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500029 -->&#160;How do I get a tape measure with markings like this?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500030 -->&#160;Use the magic math word <i>decimal</i> when you search for <i>tape measure</i>.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500031 -->&#160;Oh, math words can be powerful.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500032 -->&#160;Indeed.&#160; Yet you shouldn't feel alone in fearing fractions.&#160; Ancient Romans had that fear, even though they fearlessly conquered most Mediterranean waterfront property.&#160; That's why they used twelve marks to measure daylight hours on a sundial.&#160; The number twelve is easy to divide by two and three and four and six.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500033 -->&#160;Getting a measurement of thirteen inches sure is unlucky when I want to divide it mentally.&#160; Now I see why time is measured in numbers that aren't, uh, decimal.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500034 -->&#160;Sexagesimal.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500035 -->&#160;We're jumpin' from decimals to sex?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500036 -->&#160;Reciting infinitesimal decimal numbers during ... sensual moments would give us maximal population decline.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500037 -->&#160;Sexagesimal is the name for using sixty as a base.&#160; The ancient Babylonians made that choice to avoid fractions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500038 -->&#160;They're the ones who chose sixty minutes per hour and sixty seconds per minute.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500039 -->&#160;Sixty divides without remainders by two and three and four and five and six and ten and twelve and fifteen and twenty and thirty.&#160; That avoids fractions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500040 -->&#160;Let's demolish those damned fractions!&#160; Along with their doubly damned denominators and numerators.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0500041 -->&#160;Are fractions a bit less creepy now?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520000 -->&#160;Indeed.&#160; Now I know fractions are just a lazy way to handle division.&#160; And a sneaky way to hide division behind a disguise.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520001 -->&#160;Other words that disguise division are the words ratio, rate, proportion, average, percentage, percent, and the word per.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520002 -->&#160;I wish my elementary teachers long ago had taught these concepts so quickly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520003 -->&#160;Alas.&#160; We have to teach what's in textbooks, and what's on standardized exams.&#160; Even though foundational key concepts are more important than memorization.&#160; Especially now that Siri and Alexa can add fractions, win every spelling bee, and ace every geography exam.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520004 -->&#160;I learned to spell <i>hypotenuse</i> before I learned it had nothing to do with hippos.&#160; Does this mean schools are flunking basic education?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520005 -->&#160;Alas, sometimes our education system does seem to teach kids to gargle instead of drink at the fountain of knowledge.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520006 -->&#160;Speaking of which, now can we switch to politics from just mathematics?&#160; I'm dumbfounded to say this, yet I'm eager to learn the math behind voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520007 -->&#160;Now you're ready.&#160; You won't be scared when zero appears.&#160; And only one very simple fraction is involved.&#160; The one called half.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520008 -->&#160;Hurray!&#160; Even a half wit like me can handle a half.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520009 -->&#160;That's one divided by two.&#160; That equals zero point five.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520010 -->&#160;Or fifty percent when we want to avoid the decimal point.&#160; Now you're ready!&#160; So let's explore how votes need to be counted for results to be fair.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520011 -->&#160;Finally!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520012 -->&#160;So how do you think voting should be done?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520013 -->&#160;As you know, I'm not a math wiz.&#160; Or even a nerd.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520014 -->&#160;Damien?&#160; What do you suppose that would look like?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520015 -->&#160;Uh, ...&#160; I reckon, ...&#160; maybe ...&#160; it might use ...&#160; five stars?&#160; ...&#160; Like Amazon does?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520016 -->&#160;That's a good start.&#160; And why is that approach smart?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520017 -->&#160;If Amazon used just one star for each product, like on an 'lection ballot, that wouldn't be enough info.&#160; So what's needed in elections is more info.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520018 -->&#160;Excellent!&#160; Yes indeed!&#160; So if stars were used in elections, and the highest count of stars indicated the winner, how could you, as a voter, get some extra influence?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520019 -->&#160;I'm feelin' like a dunce.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520020 -->&#160;Let's try a different scenario.&#160; Let's suppose you're in the audience at a talent contest, and the emcee announces the loudness of clapping will determine who wins.&#160; How can you get extra influence?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520021 -->&#160;I dunno.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520022 -->&#160;Nor do I.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520023 -->&#160;You could clap really loud for your favorites.&#160; And just pretend to clap for the others, without making any sound.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520024 -->&#160;That'd be cheating.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520025 -->&#160;In a talent contest, maybe, maybe not.&#160; At theater events, that's disrespectful.&#160; But in an election, with money on the line, that's just freedom of expression.&#160; It's voting, but with an unfair kind of vote counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520026 -->&#160;Ah, it's fighting!&#160; Done on ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520027 -->&#160;So when I rate things on Amazon I should only use one star or five stars?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520028 -->&#160;If you do that on Amazon you're being a jerk.&#160; But if that star rating were used in elections, where so much is at stake, that tactic would make your ballot have more impact than ballots marked honestly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520029 -->&#160;I'm curious.&#160; What happens when Amazon customers realize they can get extra influence by skipping the middle ratings?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520030 -->&#160;Amazon stopped using simple counting, so it's less vulnerable to that tactic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520031 -->&#160;It figures Amazon has worked out those details.&#160; The ones I'm only now learnin'.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520032 -->&#160;Before we move on to counting better ballots, here's an interesting simple kind of improvement.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520033 -->&#160;I like simple.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520034 -->&#160;Consider the same kind of ballot we use now.&#160; We can change the instructions to allow the voter to mark more than just one candidate.&#160; That's called approval voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520035 -->&#160;Ah, because you either approve each candidate or leave their name unmarked.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520036 -->&#160;This sounds like Facebook.&#160; Where people upvote entertaining kitten videos and awesome dance moves.&#160; And fail to upvote the real naked truth.&#160; Well, the real truth.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520037 -->&#160;Since you brought it up, I'm guessing, approval voting might be fair?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520038 -->&#160;It's useful as a simple way for friends to choose a movie.&#160; Or a book club to reduce their book choices.&#160; And it would work OK in <i>primary</i> elections because the winner would always be from the correct party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520039 -->&#160;But in general elections the wrong party must not win.&#160; So there it would cause trouble, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520040 -->&#160;Right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520041 -->&#160;Approval voting seems similar to everyone using the clapping tactic.&#160; Where clapping loudly is approval.&#160; And just pretending to clap is disapproval.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520042 -->&#160;Exactly!&#160; You're understanding the concepts without getting distracted by names.&#160; Bravo!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520043 -->&#160;Wouldn't just changing written directions on the ballot be an easy change to make?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520044 -->&#160;I'm not politically savvy.&#160; That's outside my expertise.&#160; I just know the math behind ballot counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520045 -->&#160;On Reddit we can upvote and downvote.&#160; That's more info.&#160; Is that better?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520046 -->&#160;Only if it's counted as three ranking levels.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520047 -->&#160;Three?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520048 -->&#160;Remember zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520049 -->&#160;Ah, an upvote is like plus one.&#160; And a downvote is like minus one.&#160; And neither up nor down is like zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520050 -->&#160;If counted right that could work.&#160; But using five levels collects more information than three.&#160; And when there are lots and lots of candidates then up to about twelve preference levels would work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_desha singer_abbrev">De<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520051 -->&#160;But not unlucky thirteen.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520052 -->&#160;Yet just collecting more information isn't enough.&#160; How the information is counted to identify a winner is so important to get right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520053 -->&#160;So the five star method won't work?&#160; Because of the clapping tactic?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520054 -->&#160;I should clarify.&#160; There are two parts to any voting method.&#160; There's the ballot.&#160; And there's the counting of those ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520055 -->&#160;What kind'a ballot do we use now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520056 -->&#160;Most simple elections in most nations use what's increasingly called the single-choice ballot.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520057 -->&#160;Ah, 'cause we can only mark a single choice.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_mathprof singer_abbrev">M<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0520058 -->&#160;There's just one way to count a single-choice ballot if it's a simple election.&#160; So until recently that ballot didn't have a name.&#160; The counting method has different names.&#160; It's the enemy of fair voting so it's worth learning its names.&#160; In the academic world it's called <i>plurality voting</i>.&#160; In Canada and other British places it's called <i>first past the post</i>.</p>
