<h1>Scene 2, Money Madness</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D (Damien)<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200000 -->&#160;'ello mister Morton.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM (Jordan Morton)<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200001 -->&#160;Welcome to my home.&#160; 'N just call me Jordan.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200002 -->&#160;Mister Hawken, my fiance's father, said you make money dance.&#160; 'N I'd like to advance my state of finance.&#160; Could ya teach me some tricks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200003 -->&#160;Shall we start with some licks?&#160; In the fridge is some mint chocolate chip ice cream.&#160; Want some?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200004 -->&#160;That's too rich a taste for me.&#160; Risin' out of serfdom.&#160; That's my dream.&#160; I wanna pass to the middle class.&#160; I long to be financially secure, as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200005 -->&#160;I applaud your taste for money.&#160; Lots of folks are fond of stuffed bears, warm and fuzzy.&#160; But a wallet that's fat, just like me, what's better than that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200006 -->&#160;Without money my world feels upside down.&#160; Like a turtle on it's back.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200007 -->&#160;With money, my world feels right side up.&#160; I've got a knack for acquiring riches.&#160; Sometimes it seems like obscene amounts.&#160; Almost like payouts spilling onto the floor from a slot machine.&#160; Yet I want more.&#160; I can't afford my own jet.&#160; Or a yacht.&#160; Not there yet.&#160; I've not yet got all I want.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200008 -->&#160;So, what's the trick?&#160; Of gettin' money to fund a life not wrecked?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200009 -->&#160;You've got to treat other people with respect.&#160; <i>Before</i> you step on their toes.&#160; Then anything goes.&#160; That's the <i>trick</i>.&#160; That's how I act like a ... an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200010 -->&#160;So you put Benjamins before humans?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200011 -->&#160;Think about this.&#160; The love of money is built into our language.&#160; We have zillions of words for money.&#160; Besides Benjamins there's cash, wage, tax, price, cost, bonds, shares, rent, free, bribe.&#160; And debit, credit, payment, paycheck, bonus, income, expense, discount, options, pension, rebate, ransom.&#160; And currency, capital, deposit, investment, revenue, subsidy.&#160; And annuities, commodities, expenditures, securities. liabilities, and depreciation.&#160; Plus those awful words like charity and donation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200012 -->&#160;I see.&#160; 'N besides words for mula and dough, there're words like banker, accountant, economist, miser, embezzler, 'n vulture capitalist.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200013 -->&#160;And investor.&#160; And venture capitalist.&#160; And part-time commodity trader.&#160; Plus business owner.&#160; Those are what I am.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200014 -->&#160;Yeah, money's damn important.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200015 -->&#160;Did you know that long ago, when writing was new, writing was used for banking and accounting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200016 -->&#160;That was before my time.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200017 -->&#160;That way money was stored in banks.&#160; Not in pockets nor in bags anymore.&#160; That protected traders from pirates, thieves, and marauding desperadoes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200018 -->&#160;Ah, pirates.&#160; That was a profession back when swashbuckling exams were open to the poor.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200019 -->&#160;Pickpockets, pirates, and highway robbers have become as uncommon as blue-footed boobies.&#160; Now that money travels out of sight at the speed of light.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200020 -->&#160;'N the modern version of pirates is lawyers?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200021 -->&#160;Oh no.&#160; Today's lawyers are like ancient scribes.&#160; But they write documents quickly on computer screens and paper.&#160; Instead of slowly on clay tablets and pyramid walls.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200022 -->&#160;So how do you choose where to put the money you've got?&#160; To get more?&#160; So you don't end up singin' the blues?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200023 -->&#160;Besides side-stepping traps set by gold diggers, I only invest in high-profit deals.&#160; The ones where I become an even bigger winner.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200024 -->&#160;How come you don't invest in businesses that sell products and services that are the best?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200025 -->&#160;The high-profit one has to compensate for the other eight.&#160; The ones that flop.&#160; Like Enron, Theranos, and America Offline diskettes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200026 -->&#160;So you're seekin' the one big standout you can brag about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200027 -->&#160;Ah, yes.&#160; The unicorn.&#160; The one that swells my pockets til they burst.&#160; Missing out on one of those would be the worst.&#160; Yes, one unicorn in the forest is worth more than five zebras in the brush.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200028 -->&#160;Zebras?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200029 -->&#160;Those are the small businesses that march to riches slowly.&#160; By making something that consumers readily want.&#160; And selling a quality version at an affordable price.&#160; They don't need our venture capital for big marketing blitzes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200030 -->&#160;Isn't the whole business scene about selling what customers want?&#160; Or crave?&#160; Like nicotine, 'n chocolate milk with Cheerios?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200031 -->&#160;Sure.&#160; And yet money also can be used to oppose customer resistance.&#160; And even customer dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200032 -->&#160;What I mean is, well, I'd like to find fundin' for a business venture.&#160; I've invented a tool for cleanin' leaf gutters.&#160; Without gettin' on a ladder.&#160; So I'll ask, would ya invest in a business that sells the best kind of tool for that task?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200033 -->&#160;Nah.&#160; That would be harder to advertise than a cordless bungee-jumping franchise.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200034 -->&#160;Lots of people get hurt when they hit the dirt.&#160; From fallin' off a ladder.&#160; While cleanin' a gutter.&#160; Some land on their head, and end up dead.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200035 -->&#160;That's a great spin!&#160; Fear of fallin'.&#160; That's a fear that would sell lots of product.&#160; Do you have a patent?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200036 -->&#160;I can't afford that expense.&#160; At thousands of dollars, that cost is way too immense.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200037 -->&#160;Many tens of thousands of bucks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200038 -->&#160;That sucks.&#160; I couldn't afford even a few hundred dollars to ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200039 -->&#160;Why would I invest?&#160; Not unless there's a barrier against competitors.&#160; There's gotta be a monopoly.&#160; Either a legal monopoly, or some kind of virtual monopoly.&#160; That way my investment doesn't evaporate like a raindrop falling into Death Valley.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200040 -->&#160;So a workin' prototype's not enough?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200041 -->&#160;Sorry to sound tough, but that's too rough.&#160; That's as useless as a machine-gun mount on the back of a golf cart.&#160; What the biz needs to succeed is a big amount of income.&#160; Plus customers and testimonials.&#160; Then we might lay out some funds.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200042 -->&#160;If income I already had, I could self-fund it.&#160; 'N with that I could go to a bank 'n ask for a loan.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200043 -->&#160;Ha!&#160; The bank officials might nod earnestly instead of groan.&#160; Out loud.&#160; They might even encourage you to open an account.&#160; And get you to fill out a few forms.&#160; But after you depart, their surpressed groans will become mischievous laughter.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200044 -->&#160;If I were to buy a house, they'd loan for that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200045 -->&#160;A mortgage, hah.&#160; It doesn't work like that.&#160; Instead the bank buys the house.&#160; Your down payment's big enough to pay for a year of law school.&#160; If soon you lose your job and miss a payment, a remittance, or two, they sell the house.&#160; Then you and a couple of other delinquent homeowners have paid for a banker's kid to become a lawyer.&#160; That path leads to homelessness.&#160; Unless you have trustworthy income.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200046 -->&#160;So banks don't loan money?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200047 -->&#160;They still do a bit.&#160; Occasionally.&#160; Mostly now they're high-rolling gamblers that make casinos look like kids playing the board game Monopoly.&#160; They make big money by buying and selling, ah, another word for money, derivatives.&#160; Big things, not small things.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200048 -->&#160;What're derivatives?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200049 -->&#160;Those are contracts on paper, or the cyberspace equivalent, written by lawyers.&#160; Lots of times they're promises to pay money if something happens.&#160; Like if interest rates rise or fall.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200050 -->&#160;That sounds a lot like gamblin'.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200051 -->&#160;It is.&#160; And gambling, that's what we venture capitalists do too.&#160; We supply capital.&#160; It's like those ancient sea voyages.&#160; Someone had to buy the ship, pay sailors, and stock up on gruel and limes, before they could sail from the dock.&#160; Then, on return, if they returned, the cargo was sold.&#160; That's when the backer got his share of the gold.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200052 -->&#160;'N the captain 'n crew got what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200053 -->&#160;Most of them got just a temporary pass to the middle class.&#160; Until they got swindled or badly beaten in a casino.&#160; Or stuck with child-support and alimony payments that could have bought a nice house on a hilltop.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200054 -->&#160;But the backer got more?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200055 -->&#160;Of course.&#160; 'Cause he took the biggest risk.&#160; Remember there were pirates.&#160; And sometimes the winds were not brisk.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200056 -->&#160;Those times were cruel and barbaric.&#160; And excitin'.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200057 -->&#160;They were.&#160; In those ancient times fighting was done by soldiers.&#160; Now fighting is so much safer.&#160; It's done by lawyers.&#160; They fight with legal documents instead of swords.&#160; And instead of wearing armor, or bullet-proof vests, they wear colorful neckties.&#160; Or Victoria's Secret lingerie.&#160; Quite civilized nowadays.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200058 -->&#160;I think I see how money works.&#160; So how can I switch from bein' an employee to become an employer?&#160; Ownin' a small business, that's my dream.&#160; Some success, financially.&#160; So I can buy a fixer-upper house, pay for ultra-fast access to, er, ..., kitten videos, 'n drive a car that didn't come off Henry Ford's production line.&#160; Not a private jet.&#160; Not even just a log cabin in the woods.&#160; Not yet.&#160; I just want fair rewards for my hard work.&#160; How do I make that leap?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200059 -->&#160;You need to dig deep, to develop a compelling vision.&#160; A lofty one that will inspire.&#160; Then you hire workers who follow your vision like ducklings behind their mom.&#160; You work them hard.&#160; You hire lawyers to sue competitors.&#160; And of course you hire marketing folks who super-size your PR blitzes.&#160; They'll make ads that are so grand that consumers will trust your brand.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200060 -->&#160;So I should start a cult?&#160; 'N of course there'd be an app with that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200061 -->&#160;A cult would put you on the wealthy map.&#160; If you shift the idolatry to money.&#160; Instead of focusing on death, or sex, or fashion color.&#160; In fact, that's not a bad way to say what business leaders really do.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200062 -->&#160;It sounds like makin' money is about lyin' 'n cheatin'.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200063 -->&#160;It's not lying.&#160; That's not cheating.&#160; It's marketing and stepping on toes.&#160; In fact anything goes.&#160; But not lying and cheating.&#160; 'Cause that lands you in the slammer.&#160; That'd be a bummer 'cause your bank accounts in prison are as useless as a light saber against an assault rifle.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200064 -->&#160;To get ahead financially I have to step on people's toes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200065 -->&#160;Or a gentle push to the nose.&#160; Business is all about competition.&#160; It's the very foundation of a free market.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200066 -->&#160;Stomping on toes.&#160; Anything goes.&#160; That's the trick of corporations.&#160; How come they're the winners in the business world?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200067 -->&#160;Ah, the key is politics.&#160; We shareholders and investors give money to politicians.&#160; Then to us they listen.&#160; That's not cheating.&#160; It's not against any law.&#160; I share mula with any politician who passes laws that dump big amounts of golden coins into my bank accounts.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200068 -->&#160;After your money buys you a louder voice, in politics, what do ya get from the politicians you buy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200069 -->&#160;Tax breaks and subsidies.&#160; And sometimes legal monopolies.&#160; Oh I do love these.&#160; With these breaks, my business thrives.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200070 -->&#160;But not so for others' lives.&#160; The customers.&#160; The employees.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200071 -->&#160;If someone else gets beaten, that's their choice.&#160; They need to speak up with a louder voice.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200072 -->&#160;Don't you fear the folks who want to tax the wealthy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200073 -->&#160;The business that I closely own, with more profit it could buy a beach house, or ski lodge, or yacht.&#160; Something I don't yet got.&#160; Besides my timeshare in Hawai'i.&#160; My biz buddies and I would share it.&#160; Or rent it to me for almost free.&#160; That tactic evades hefty income tax rates.&#160; So an extra tax on the rich, it misses me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200074 -->&#160;So the key is ownin' a biz?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200075 -->&#160;Indeed.&#160; And that qualifies me to become a board member at two other businesses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200076 -->&#160;There are places that pay you to work at getting bored?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200077 -->&#160;Not that kind of board.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200078 -->&#160;Is it like redwood or cardboard?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200079 -->&#160;A board of directors is the legal entity that runs a corporation.&#160; We represent the shareholders.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200080 -->&#160;Ah, board is the name of the table where deciders decide.&#160; I mean, where directors direct.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200081 -->&#160;We can even fire the CEO.&#160; That's chief executive officer.&#160; At those board meetings, that's meetings of the board of directors, we vote to reduce labor costs.&#160; Then we vote to give ourselves a huge bonus using the profit from the previous year's labor-cost chop.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200082 -->&#160;That's how come you can afford to live on this hilltop?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200083 -->&#160;Do you like my panoramic view?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200084 -->&#160;I'm seeing lots of stuff I hadn't seen before.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200085 -->&#160;The cost of travel to those board meetings is deductible.&#160; That's another money word that brings me joy.&#160; Plus I lounge for days before and after at a fancy spot with a date who's hot.&#160; Or at least I rent a Beemer convertible and indulge in rich meals with someone like flirty Felicity Dimwittle.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200113 -->&#160;To see what I mean, consider the music industry.&#160; The way it was years ago, before a recording studio got squeezed into a laptop computer.&#160; Back then, cutting a record, literally, meant cutting grooves on a master disk.&#160; That process used very expensive equipment to transform sound waves into vibrations of the cutting needle.&#160; That equipment was so rare that musicians would work for cheap.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200114 -->&#160;Or trade sex for a record deal?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200116 -->&#160;Oh, that's why we can't sing the Beatles song <i>Let It Be</i> in public.&#160; Now I see.&#160; Record labels lost their bottleneck because they used to monopolize the technology that now fits inside a tablet app.&#160; Aren't newspapers losing their grip too?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200118 -->&#160;Doesn't a patent provide a bottleneck?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200119 -->&#160;In theory, yeah.&#160; But really, a patent bottleneck only works for a big big invention.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200122 -->&#160;So the idea behind a monopoly is to block competitors?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200123 -->&#160;That's the key.&#160; A technology monopoly or a legal monopoly are two of the best.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200128 -->&#160;So cookies could be made sweet naturally with less sugar?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0200130 -->&#160;That sounds like an inside scam.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000003 -->&#160;Does that mean food also can't claim health benefits?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000022 -->&#160;That has to be giving campaign contributions to political candidates.&#160; After they get re-elected they protect the laws that give our business tax break after tax break.&#160; And they protect our legal monopolies, and taxpayer-funded subsidies.&#160; That's why big businesses pay six-figure salaries so freely.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000023 -->&#160;Ah yes, money in politics.&#160; I know 'bout that.&#160; But I don't yet understand why us voters, er, ... how it works.&#160; Non-rich voters greatly outnumber the wealthy, so how can money outweigh those votes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000024 -->&#160;We've infiltrated both parties.&#160; This is how we control who wins the primary elections of both parties.&#160; So general elections are between a puppet Republican and a puppet Democrat.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc singer_abbrev">JM<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000026 -->&#160;In the primary, the winner's always from the correct party, so the money bias goes unchallenged.&#160; In the general election, Republican voters assume Democrats are dimwits.&#160; And Democratic voters assume Republicans are dimwits.&#160; But then it's too late.&#160; For added insurance in a tight race we might give a bit of money to an unpopular candidate we hate.&#160; But we give far more to the one we choose.&#160; That way we can't lose.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0000027 -->&#160;How come news reporters don't expose what's behind those magic tricks?</p>
