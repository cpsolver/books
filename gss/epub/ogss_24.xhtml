<h1>About author Richard Fobes</h1>
<p class="para_standard">Richard Fobes is the author of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i> which is a how-to book on creative problem solving.&#160; It has been published around the world in ten languages.</p> <p class="para_standard">The story of <i>The Goat Spitting Secret</i> arose in Richard's mind as a dialog between different voices in his head.&#160; These different voices arose because Richard has experienced, at least briefly, being a corporate CEO, homeless person, commodity trader, manual laborer, business owner, hardware store clerk, landlord, renter, only male or only native English speaker in a household, member of a Christian religion created by a woman, physics student, grad student, atmospheric scientist, software developer, contract technical writer, neighborhood organizer, election-method expert, inventor, dance performance group leader, and dance instructor.</p> <p class="para_standard">Richard does not regard either the Republican party or the Democratic party to be representative of his political views.&#160; He registers with one party or the other just so he can vote for candidates in primary elections.&#160; He switches that registration periodically.</p> <p class="para_standard">Richard's understanding of vote counting started when he was in a small music-and-dance organization that was voting on a new logo design.&#160; Initially there were two designs.&#160; Richard submitted a third design he regarded as an improvement on the better of the two original designs.&#160; Although Richard's design was chosen because it got the most votes, the worst design came close to winning.&#160; This experience triggered his aha moment about vote splitting.&#160; That insight led to creating an innovative vote-counting method and including it in <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>, developing further aspects of VoteFair Ranking and writing a book about it titled <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i>, creating interactive websites at VoteFair.org and NegotiationTool.com, and testifying to the Oregon state legislature and the City of Portland Charter Commission in support of well-chosen ways to count <i>ranked choice ballots</i>.</p> <p class="para_standard">Richard started life in southern California (Oceanside, at the north end of San Diego county), then moved to central California (Davis, a university town), then to mid-valley Oregon (Corvallis, another university town), and finally to northern Oregon (Portland, a big city).</p> <p class="para_standard">To see a list of projects created by Richard Fobes, including books, websites, software, and a new programming language, plus a video of him dancing, point your browser to SolutionsCreative dot com.</p> <p class="para_centered"><img width="200" height="196" src="author.jpg"/></p> <p class="para_standard">This photo of the author was taken in early 1993 while waiting for the first printing of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>.</p>
