<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100024 -->&#160;Yeah.&#160; It's a big kink in democracy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100025 -->&#160;How come laws favor the wealthy?&#160; We make a big fuss.&#160; Yet the few rich outvote us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100026 -->&#160;I wonder what happens to our votes.&#160; Are we just rabbits living near a den of coyotes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100027 -->&#160;I'm beginning to think the only prognosis is hopelessness.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100028 -->&#160;Maybe it's hypnosis.&#160; Or the political ads I suppose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100029 -->&#160;We can see through those.&#160; Something is hidden.&#160; There's got to be another villain.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100030 -->&#160;A conspiracy?&#160; A dark-money tyranny?&#160; Or a Bermuda pentagon with two sides missing?</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100034 -->&#160;On a warpath?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100035 -->&#160;Getting herded.&#160; Their shamans spoke <span class="explain">[speaking clearly]</span> <i>White chieftains are lying wolves who herd us like buffalo.&#160; From our grazing lands to dry deserts where foods don't grow.&#160; They feed their greed beyond their need.</i></p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100038 -->&#160;Financially, our life's so far upside down from where I want it to be.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100041 -->&#160;When dinner's got veggies and meat, our car's gas gauge says stay off the street.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100042 -->&#160;My dental smile gives us cheer.&#160; But now when dining out we can't afford beer.&#160; Our finances are dreadful.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100043 -->&#160;It's ....&#160; What's that word?&#160; Like evil.&#160; Like diablo.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100044 -->&#160;Diabolical?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100045 -->&#160;That's it!&#160; It's diabolical!&#160; It's a shakedown.&#160; The wealthy say that money trickles down.&#160; Maybe it does, temporarily.&#160; But not as fast as it drains from our wallet.&#160; Just for the bare necessities.&#160; They claim that working hard is a good bet.&#160; And yet, Las Vegas has better odds at roulette.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100046 -->&#160;Do you want a chocolate truffle?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100047 -->&#160;Something brown to get me down?&#160; No thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100048 -->&#160;They're delicious.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100049 -->&#160;I'm suspicious.&#160; Something is going on behind our backs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100050 -->&#160;Yes, right in front of our eyes.</p>

<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100051 -->&#160;Work and cash should come as a pair.&#160; But one without the other.&#160; That's not effing fair!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100052 -->&#160;Yeah.&#160; We're indentured to jerks.&#160; And getting only table-scrap perks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100053 -->&#160;It ain't right.&#160; The boss I've got is almost a saint.&#160; Yet he says he's drowning in taxes.&#160; And licenses.&#160; And insurance.&#160; And extra fees.&#160; Just keeping track of these, plus posting the Spanish translation of the pregnancy accommodation rules for dogs brought to work by employees, adds another employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100054 -->&#160;That leaves less money for me.&#160; Your paycheck is like a balloon with a leak.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100055 -->&#160;Times are bleak.&#160; I know how to invent.&#160; But that don't pay the rent.&#160; Not yet.&#160; And it won't if I'm not able to own my own biz.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100056 -->&#160;I get a distressed feeling when I see you leaning over our balcony railing.&#160; I fret.&#160; Because I've read that suicide is done by guys who can't yet find anyone else to blame.&#160; So who do you think has rigged the political game?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100057 -->&#160;I dunno.&#160; Politics's so complex.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100058 -->&#160;Yeah.&#160; Everything interconnects.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100059 -->&#160;Yet surely somewhere, maybe sitting in a yoga pose on a high mountaintop.&#160; Or kneeling at an altar in a Gothic cathedral.&#160; Or standing behind a counter asking <i>Do you want cheesy garlic bread with your pasta?</i>&#160; There's just got to be a geek, or geekette, who knows the secret.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100060 -->&#160;Even Google couldn't find that tiny grain of truth in a pet shop's inventory of cat litter.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100061 -->&#160;Especially because most online search has kickback associations with big corporations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100062 -->&#160;Let's just say you found a guru who knew.&#160; What would be your query?&#160; Specifically.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100063 -->&#160;How can we get better democracy?&#160; ...&#160; Wait.&#160; Not that.&#160; Ah yes.&#160; I would ask <i>What's at the root of unfairness ... in politics and business?</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100064 -->&#160;Bright professors teach at our city's college.&#160; In political science they teach about the electrical, er, electoral college.&#160; And gerrymand ... whatever.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100065 -->&#160;Katerina.&#160; You know I would rather walk into a rattlesnake cage than turn another textbook page.&#160; Those pages shake my eyes faster than the snake's tail.&#160; My brain throbs as weaselly words try to drag me through dates and definitions.&#160; And the names of Thomas Jefferson's pets.&#160; And tests, those effing devils.&#160; They just rat out those of us who didn't read the textbook.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100066 -->&#160;Now that's a real conspiracy.&#160; Textbooks and tests are in bed together.&#160; Making baby test questions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100067 -->&#160;Just being inside a classroom feels like I've stepped into a boxing ring.&#160; Without wearing boxing gloves.&#160; Instead holding pom poms.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100068 -->&#160;Ah yes.&#160; Community college classes already knocked you out for the count.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100069 -->&#160;Does it matter?&#160; History is just fat with notes from the past.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100070 -->&#160;Yup.&#160; Like an Elvis museum.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100071 -->&#160;One math teacher told me one day that a monkey ... with a bad r&#233;sum&#233; ... could have done better than me on his tests.&#160; And fractions.&#160; Those were created by the devil!&#160; When he was in a snit!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100072 -->&#160;I have to admit.&#160; Sometimes I slipped just a bit.&#160; In the academic jungle.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100073 -->&#160;Anyways, do political scientists really understand how come politics's so perverted?&#160; So inverted?&#160; Surely, if they saw clearly, then Congress would better the economy.&#160; And then we wouldn't be stuck in this financial muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100074 -->&#160;I agree.&#160; Political scientists do seem unscientific.&#160; And times seem horrific.&#160; I suppose you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100075 -->&#160;Who should I fight?&#160; Where's that thing?&#160; The tilting place?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100076 -->&#160;The tipping point?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100077 -->&#160;Yeah.&#160; How can we, the majority, get to where we can outvote the endless dollars of one percenters?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100078 -->&#160;Father knows some jet setters.&#160; From a distance.&#160; I'll ask him for assistance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100079 -->&#160;I know I'm not the sharpest banana in the fruit basket.&#160; But if there should be a really sharp banana.&#160; Someone maybe who can tell me, without pointing to a big book, why the world is so upside down, then I'll struggle to learn.&#160; And then I'll struggle to turn things right side up!&#160; So I can earn more dough.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100080 -->&#160;When you find out who's to blame, for corruption in the governmental game, what then?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100081 -->&#160;Then I'll shift from working hard for the masters we serve to earning the money we deserve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100082 -->&#160;If you don't get out of your slump, are you gonna jump?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100083 -->&#160;I won't jump.&#160; I'm not a chump.&#160; It might take awhile.&#160; But I'll jump back on the crocodile.&#160; And keep on riding.&#160; Because I'm dying.&#160; To know how come things are upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100084 -->&#160;As long as you are not dying on me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100085 -->&#160;Some people say this is just the way it'll always be.&#160; But it's not okay.&#160; It's not fair!&#160; Seats in Congress should go to the wise.&#160; Yet sitting there now are selfish liars.&#160; We wanna elect problem-solving leaders.&#160; But what do we get?&#160; Egotistic special-interest puppets.&#160; Whose masters treat us like light bulbs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100086 -->&#160;Yeah, screwed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100087 -->&#160;I wanna change the world and turn it right side up!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100088 -->&#160;The impossible.&#160; That's part of why I love you so.&#160; You want things to be fair.&#160; You really care!&#160; But you'll need lots and lots of luck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100089 -->&#160;Yet with it I hope to discover a way out of this muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance singer_abbrev">K<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100090 -->&#160;Then finally we can reach prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien singer_abbrev">D<span class="singer_colon">:</span></span><!-- 0100091 -->&#160;And suffer less adversity.</p>
