Are you professor
o-o
name-econhist no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist-firstuse amenn
Yes. Are you two
o-o
Demon and Dasha?

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Welcome to my
o-o
classroom.
o-o
Would you like some
o-o
pistachios?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm so
o-o
full of nuts
o-o
I could get a
o-o
dozen squirrels
o-o
through winter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We're wired on
o-o
espresso.
o-o
So let's go!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm hungry
o-o
to learn.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We came to learn
o-o
the dark arts
o-o
of economics.
o-o
Please tell us
o-o
what will happen
o-o
when elections
o-o
are fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
When vote splittin's
o-o
no longer
o-o
skewing
o-o
the outcome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not goat
o-o
spitting.
o-o
It's vote
o-o
splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We know it's
o-o
super
o-o
challengin'
o-o
to predict
o-o
the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's mostly what
o-o
us economists
o-o
are paid to do.
o-o
Predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are they,
o-o
well you too,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
usually right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sometimes yes,
o-o
and then we
o-o
modestly say
o-o
begin-italics I told you so end-italics no-space .
o-o
Sometimes no,
o-o
and then we
o-o
apply for a
o-o
research grant
o-o
to study why
o-o
we were wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you get paid more
o-o
if you're wrong?
o-o
Are economists
o-o
wealthy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
your espresso
o-o
is showing.
o-o
Professor,
o-o
do you have a
o-o
general notion
o-o
'bout what will
o-o
change?
o-o
Especially
o-o
in Washington.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course!
o-o
Lots of new laws
o-o
will be
o-o
passed.
o-o
Then a few
o-o
people who
o-o
greatly profit
o-o
from existing
o-o
conditions might
o-o
temporarily
o-o
earn less money,
o-o
and almost everyone
o-o
else will enjoy
o-o
increased prosperity.
o-o
And that increase
o-o
will feed back to
o-o
the ones who
o-o
temporarily
o-o
lost some of their
o-o
income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's your
o-o
justification?
o-o
For that prediction?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That trend has been
o-o
going on throughout
o-o
civilization
o-o
and history.
o-o
Not counting
o-o
setbacks
o-o
caused by
o-o
warfare.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can you
o-o
explain why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Imagine the economy
o-o
as a strawberry pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not fond of
o-o
strawberry pie.
o-o
Can we call it
o-o
a cherry pie?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course. Now
o-o
imagine the economy
o-o
is a cherry pie.
o-o
If some people
o-o
cut themselves
o-o
a slice that is
o-o
too big, then other
o-o
people end up with
o-o
smaller slices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm following this.
o-o
Wow!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What would you like
o-o
to call the people
o-o
who take too big
o-o
of a slice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
People in the
o-o
political down.
o-o
As opposed to the
o-o
political left
o-o
'n political
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'N the people
o-o
who get too little
o-o
would be people
o-o
in the political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Bravo!
o-o
I'll bet you
o-o
had to struggle
o-o
to get your
o-o
bearings
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
jungle.
o-o
So,
o-o
the way I see it,
o-o
if elections
o-o
were fair,
o-o
then elected
o-o
leaders
o-o
would care
o-o
more about
o-o
the people
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up,
o-o
where most
o-o
of us are,
o-o
get too little
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the part
o-o
we've figured
o-o
out.
o-o
And the fact that
o-o
the replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
wouldn't lie
o-o
...
o-o
as much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Those replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
would pass laws
o-o
that give bigger
o-o
slices of
o-o
economic
o-o
pie
o-o
to the
o-o
majority
o-o
of voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So far
o-o
this is
o-o
easier
o-o
than playing
o-o
air guitar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When I took
o-o
economics
o-o
one oh one,
o-o
it wasn't
o-o
this fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We'll get to some
o-o
complicated
o-o
bits swiftly,
o-o
and they involve
o-o
bits of
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o
not silly
o-o
wonky
o-o
history.
o-o
I learned some.
o-o
But I'm done
o-o
with the past.
o-o
It's gone.
o-o
Why do people
o-o
dwell on that
o-o
old stuffy
o-o
stuff?
o-o
Other than
o-o
using it
o-o
to play
o-o
trivia
o-o
games.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here I'm walking
o-o
backwards.
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
this is like
o-o
moving forward
o-o
in time.
o-o
The future
o-o
is behind me
o-o
where I
o-o
cannot see.
o-o
So I look
o-o
where I've been.
o-o
That's the past.
o-o
The patterns
o-o
give me clues
o-o
about
o-o
that which is
o-o
yet to be.
o-o
So history
o-o
is like a
o-o
crystal ball.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I see!
o-o
History
o-o
is a preview
o-o
of the future.
o-o
Who knew?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Many people
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
focus on
o-o
history
o-o
as recalling
o-o
facts about
o-o
the past.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In a history
o-o
trivia contest
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would beat me
o-o
like the loudest
o-o
drum in a
o-o
marchin' band.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would be
o-o
a great way
o-o
to learn
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My eyes are
o-o
cryin'
o-o
just thinkin'
o-o
about reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
so much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said that
o-o
reading glasses
o-o
with a blue tint
o-o
helps with books.
o-o
A good browser
o-o
can change
o-o
Wikipedia's
o-o
white background
o-o
to blue.
o-o
See how that looks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll give that
o-o
trick a try.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Rather than facts,
o-o
what's more useful
o-o
regarding
o-o
history
o-o
is causation.
o-o
Cause and effect.
o-o
Especially
o-o
when it involves
o-o
a surprise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can ya translate
o-o
that into a
o-o
for instance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If that's
o-o
what it takes,
o-o
here's one that
o-o
involves snakes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The political kind?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Cobras.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I like them,
o-o
at a distance.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A city in
o-o
India
o-o
had a problem
o-o
with too many
o-o
cobra snakes.
o-o
So they put
o-o
a bounty
o-o
on the snakes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize bounty
o-o
as another word
o-o
for money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the cause.
o-o
So what would you
o-o
expect
o-o
to be the
o-o
effect?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Fewer cobra snakes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You mentioned
o-o
surprises.
o-o
So I'll guess the
o-o
number of snakes
o-o
increased.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed, the cobra
o-o
population increased.
o-o
So the test question
o-o
is: why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I hate tests.
o-o
They are
o-o
rodent pests
o-o
that scare my wits
o-o
into a
o-o
dark corner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Flunk!
o-o
With your brain,
o-o
try to maintain
o-o
your focus on
o-o
the topic,
o-o
the subject,
o-o
the concept.
o-o
Don't try to push
o-o
away the fear.
o-o
Figure out why
o-o
you still cling
o-o
to the fear.
o-o
Then just let go
o-o
of the fear.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Got it.
o-o
I'll let go of
o-o
the scare.
o-o
I'll focus on
o-o
the snake.
o-o
There's less fear there.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So why did the
o-o
cobra population
o-o
increase?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When money gets
o-o
offered for something
o-o
then people do
o-o
what it takes to
o-o
get that money.
o-o
Enterprising city
o-o
residents went into
o-o
the cobra snake
o-o
breeding business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess that
o-o
after realizing
o-o
what was going on,
o-o
the bounty was ended
o-o
and those extra
o-o
snakes got released?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus!
o-o
That's what happened.
o-o
This historical
o-o
event reminds
o-o
us to consider
o-o
otherwise
o-o
unexpected
o-o
consequences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
There are lots of
o-o
awful unfair
o-o
consequences
o-o
of Congress and
o-o
its corruption,
o-o
but those shouldn't
o-o
be unexpected.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's look
o-o
at one of the
o-o
problems that
o-o
economists face.
o-o
You've heard of
o-o
the gross domestic
o-o
product,
o-o
the GDP?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah, it measures,
o-o
well, when it goes
o-o
up, that's good.
o-o
'N when it goes
o-o
down, that's bad.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
So here's the next
o-o
test question.
o-o
Does the GDP
o-o
go up or down
o-o
when a family's
o-o
house burns down?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This seems like
o-o
another trick
o-o
question so I'll
o-o
say GDP
o-o
goes up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
C plus.
o-o
For an A you need
o-o
to tell me why.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because building the
o-o
replacement house,
o-o
or more likely the
o-o
selling of the property
o-o
to a developer who
o-o
builds a condominium,
o-o
is business activity,
o-o
and that's what GDP
o-o
measures.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
Yes, GDP just
o-o
measures transfers
o-o
of money.
o-o
When nothing is
o-o
bought or sold
o-o
there's no change
o-o
in gross domestic
o-o
product.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That is gross.
o-o
But what's this
o-o
got to do with
o-o
election
o-o
vote hyphen-here counting
o-o
reform?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When people are
o-o
optimistic about
o-o
the future,
o-o
GDP goes up
o-o
because people
o-o
buy more products,
o-o
pay for more
o-o
services,
o-o
eat out, and
o-o
make babies.
o-o
But when people
o-o
are pessimistic
o-o
about the future,
o-o
they fearfully cling
o-o
to their money,
o-o
so there are
o-o
fewer transfers
o-o
of money.
o-o
And when
o-o
they postpone
o-o
making babies,
o-o
there are fewer
o-o
future
o-o
customers.
o-o
All that pulls
o-o
down GDP.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
N' you think
o-o
people will become
o-o
optimistic when
o-o
fairer voting
o-o
methods are
o-o
adopted?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The short answer
o-o
is yes.
o-o
The fuller answer
o-o
involves what's
o-o
happening now in
o-o
the economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I keep hearing
o-o
the economy's
o-o
on the climbing
o-o
path of a
o-o
roller coaster.
o-o
But I'm in
o-o
one of the cars
o-o
that's derailed,
o-o
and I'm
o-o
plunging
o-o
fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The stock market
o-o
keeps going up and up
o-o
because people
o-o
with money have
o-o
few other places
o-o
to invest it.
o-o
Specifically
o-o
certificates
o-o
of deposit
o-o
don't yield much
o-o
interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
o-o
That gives the stock
o-o
market sort of a
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So stocks are
o-o
like an
o-o
over-inflated
o-o
balloon.
o-o
Does that mean our
o-o
roller coaster
o-o
ride will soon
o-o
plummet?
o-o
And the poor
o-o
will all die?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's difficult
o-o
to predict when
o-o
it will drop
o-o
from its
o-o
recent
o-o
top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You said
o-o
economists
o-o
predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Knowing begin-italics what end-italics will
o-o
happen is
o-o
different
o-o
from knowing begin-italics when end-italics
o-o
those whats will
o-o
happen.
o-o
Professors
o-o
of economics
o-o
focus on
o-o
rational
o-o
behavior.
o-o
But successful
o-o
investors earn
o-o
lots of money
o-o
by knowing the
o-o
stock market
o-o
can stay
o-o
irrational
o-o
longer than
o-o
investors
o-o
can stay
o-o
solvent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
o-o
Economists
o-o
assume people
o-o
are smart.
o-o
This explains why
o-o
they,
o-o
and you,
o-o
aren't wealthy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Our math proofs
o-o
do have
o-o
some goofs.
o-o
After all,
o-o
measuring
o-o
stupidity
o-o
is tricky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of
o-o
morons,
o-o
why doesn't
o-o
the economy
o-o
work for
o-o
hard workers
o-o
like me?
o-o
The numbers lie.
o-o
They say
o-o
everything's
o-o
hunky dory.
o-o
Is this an example
o-o
of mathiness?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I don't know what
o-o
mathiness is.
o-o
But numbers can
o-o
be deceptive.
o-o
What many people
o-o
overlook is that
o-o
the unemployment
o-o
rate that's in the news
o-o
just counts people
o-o
who are now getting
o-o
unemployment
o-o
benefits.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Those benefits
o-o
run out after a
o-o
few months of having
o-o
no job. I've learned
o-o
that from
o-o
experience.
o-o
So unemployment
o-o
is actually higher,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, it's higher.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why don't economists
o-o
measure that?
o-o
The real unemployment
o-o
rate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The government
o-o
does measure that
o-o
as well.
o-o
But most
o-o
newspapers and
o-o
TV stations
o-o
report the
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate
o-o
that
o-o
government
o-o
officials call
o-o
attention to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since wealthy
o-o
business owners
o-o
own news sources,
o-o
they probably
o-o
tell their
o-o
reporters
o-o
to report the
o-o
lower rate.
o-o
That gives
o-o
consumers
o-o
the confidence
o-o
to spend dollars
o-o
more freely.
o-o
And that gives
o-o
the wealthy
o-o
more sales,
o-o
more money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought it was
o-o
just the
o-o
government
o-o
being sneaky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's both.
o-o
The government
o-o
knows that if they
o-o
call attention
o-o
to the higher
o-o
unemployment rate,
o-o
then some of the
o-o
optimism
o-o
disappears.
o-o
Then the economy
o-o
and the GDP
o-o
would trend
o-o
downward.
o-o
And that would
o-o
activate a
o-o
bad feedback loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's a
o-o
weed black poop?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Get your head
o-o
out of that
o-o
gloomy
o-o
pot smoker's
o-o
toilet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A feedback loop.
o-o
When you're in
o-o
an auditorium
o-o
and the sound
o-o
system squeals,
o-o
that's a
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh yeah.
o-o
That's when
o-o
...
o-o
a tiny sound
o-o
at the microphone
o-o
...
o-o
gets amplified
o-o
...
o-o
'n comes out the
o-o
speakers
o-o
...
o-o
'n gets
o-o
back to the
o-o
microphone
o-o
...
o-o
just slightly
o-o
louder than
o-o
before.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It becomes
o-o
as loud as possible
o-o
as fast as
o-o
possible.
o-o
And a feeback loop
o-o
is what makes a
o-o
hurricane
o-o
so powerful.
o-o
There are lots of
o-o
feedback loops.
o-o
That's what's
o-o
behind
o-o
economic
o-o
inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

o-o
then gets a raise
o-o
to afford rising
o-o
toy prices.
o-o
Then the
o-o
grocery store
o-o
slightly raises
o-o
its prices
o-o
to cover that
o-o
cost increase.
o-o
Then that feeds back
o-o
to the original
o-o
employee who
o-o
shops at that
o-o
grocery store.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's inflation,
o-o
when salaries
o-o
and prices
o-o
increase
o-o
together.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That feedback loop
o-o
has to be slowed down
o-o
by doing something
o-o
that decouples
o-o
at least one
o-o
of the links
o-o
in the loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So announcing
o-o
a higher rate of
o-o
unemployment
o-o
would undermine
o-o
optimism.
o-o
And that would
o-o
bring down
o-o
the economy.
o-o
And that would
o-o
cause more
o-o
layoffs.
o-o
And that would
o-o
speed up
o-o
how fast the
o-o
economy
o-o
goes down.
o-o
This makes sense.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Governments
o-o
try to make the
o-o
economy
o-o
grow fast.
o-o
And yet also
o-o
keep inflation
o-o
slow.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the concept.
o-o
Of course
o-o
my students
o-o
have to say it
o-o
with the right
o-o
terminology.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Otherwise they'd
o-o
get bad grades
o-o
on standardized
o-o
tests, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes.
o-o
I have to teach
o-o
to the tests.
o-o
Yet the important
o-o
parts of economics
o-o
are the concepts,
o-o
and that's why it's
o-o
a delight to get
o-o
to explain them
o-o
to you two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
I'm thinkin'
o-o
here the
o-o
concept is
o-o
...
o-o
your poop
o-o
scooper loop's
o-o
a feedback
o-o
loop?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's different.
o-o
Dog owners
o-o
have to care
o-o
about the health
o-o
of other dogs
o-o
to protect
o-o
their own dog's
o-o
health.
o-o
Here, in
o-o
economic
o-o
kinds of
o-o
feedback loops,
o-o
begin-italics self hyphen-here interest end-italics
o-o
is the
o-o
motivation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, the
o-o
employees
o-o
ask for a
o-o
higher salary
o-o
for selfish
o-o
reasons.
o-o
'N the business
o-o
owners sell
o-o
at higher
o-o
prices
o-o
for selfish
o-o
reasons.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Right.
o-o
In economic
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
the changes
o-o
happen because
o-o
each person
o-o
focuses on
o-o
what they
o-o
themselves
o-o
want.
o-o
Without caring
o-o
about what
o-o
others want.
o-o
Like with those
o-o
cobra snake
o-o
breeders.
o-o
They didn't
o-o
much care
o-o
how many
o-o
cobra snakes
o-o
are in the
o-o
city.
o-o
Their actions
o-o
were just based on
o-o
monetary
o-o
self hyphen-here interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
o-o
Dog owners,
o-o
the pooper
o-o
scooper ones,
o-o
care how many
o-o
piles of dog poop
o-o
their dog
o-o
can sniff.
o-o
But that's
o-o
affected by
o-o
other dog
o-o
owners.
o-o
There's no
o-o
benefit
o-o
to poop
o-o
scooping
o-o
if other
o-o
dog owners
o-o
don't scoop
o-o
too.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You've got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey!
o-o
...
o-o
Wait a moment.
o-o
...
o-o
Feedback loops
o-o
are what rich
o-o
business owners
o-o
use to get
o-o
oversized slices
o-o
of economic pie!
o-o
They use lawyers.
o-o
And they control
o-o
news sources.
o-o
And they control
o-o
politicians.
o-o
They use
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to give themselves
o-o
bigger
o-o
and bigger
o-o
slices of
o-o
cherry pie.
o-o
No wonder
o-o
I'm hungry,
o-o
economically.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yet why
o-o
does it seem
o-o
that rent
o-o
'n food
o-o
'n ice cream
o-o
are going up
o-o
and up fast
o-o
while salaries
o-o
stay stuck?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not your
o-o
imagination.
o-o
The cost of living
o-o
is going up
o-o
faster than
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
which is the
o-o
official
o-o
measurement
o-o
of inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's another
o-o
corrupt
o-o
measurement.
o-o
The consumer
o-o
price index.
o-o
But I forgot
o-o
why it's corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You didn't forget.
o-o
We can't teach why
o-o
to undergrads.
o-o
Part of the why
o-o
is because
o-o
back when the price
o-o
of food items
o-o
were quickly
o-o
rising,
o-o
some food items
o-o
were replaced by
o-o
items whose cost
o-o
were declining.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's declining
o-o
in cost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The per hyphen-here pixel cost
o-o
of digital
o-o
cameras.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize
o-o
that word begin-italics per end-italics no-space .
o-o
It means division.
o-o
And the number
o-o
of pixels in
o-o
a camera
o-o
are going up,
o-o
so dividing by
o-o
that bigger number
o-o
makes the result
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So that's another way
o-o
the government
o-o
is hiding the real
o-o
cost of living.
o-o
I can guess why
o-o
they're not being
o-o
transparent.
o-o
But something else
o-o
is going on, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Some government
o-o
expenses
o-o
are matched to the
o-o
consumer price
o-o
index.
o-o
Such as
o-o
retirement
o-o
pensions for
o-o
government
o-o
employees,
o-o
and social
o-o
security
o-o
benefits.
o-o
And that index's
o-o
linked to the
o-o
interest
o-o
they pay for
o-o
borrowed
o-o
money.
o-o
So the
o-o
government
o-o
wants inflation
o-o
to stay low.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the government
o-o
saves lots of money
o-o
by pretending
o-o
inflation
o-o
is low,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
And as another
o-o
trick they
o-o
get to exclude
o-o
rent and fuel,
o-o
which are rising
o-o
quickly.
o-o
They're
o-o
excluded
o-o
from that index
o-o
because they're
o-o
too volatile.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means they
o-o
go up and down
o-o
like a nervous
o-o
kangaroo rat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is anything else
o-o
being fudged?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Besides hot
o-o
sundaes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
do you
o-o
remember from
o-o
econ one oh one
o-o
what determines
o-o
interest rates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The federal
o-o
reserve chooses
o-o
when to increase
o-o
and decrease the
o-o
interest rate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the rate
o-o
talked about
o-o
in the news,
o-o
but more important
o-o
is the rate
o-o
determined by
o-o
auctioning
o-o
treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I don't remember
o-o
learning about
o-o
those actions,
o-o
I mean,
o-o
auctions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not taught to
o-o
undergrads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll bet textbooks
o-o
don't include it
o-o
because schools
o-o
are funded by
o-o
the government.
o-o
So textbooks can't
o-o
reveal secrets
o-o
the government
o-o
wants to hide.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, that's another
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
All these feedback
o-o
loops!
o-o
They make math seem
o-o
simple.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I agree.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
U.S. treasuries
o-o
are sold in
o-o
auctions.
o-o
In economically
o-o
optimistic
o-o
times those
o-o
treasuries
o-o
sell for
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
closer to the
o-o
amount the
o-o
government pays
o-o
when they reach their
o-o
redemption date.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but in
o-o
economically
o-o
pessimistic
o-o
times the buyers
o-o
pay much less.
o-o
That increases
o-o
the gap between
o-o
purchase price
o-o
and redemption
o-o
payment. So that
o-o
brings up rates
o-o
of interest,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, I think I'm
o-o
following.
o-o
Since interest
o-o
rates are low,
o-o
that means there's
o-o
lots of buyers
o-o
for those
o-o
...
o-o
things?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
Yes, normally.
o-o
But China and
o-o
Russia stopped
o-o
buying them so
o-o
lately the
o-o
federal reserve
o-o
has been buying
o-o
lots of them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would be like
o-o
the plush toy
o-o
dinosaur
o-o
business
o-o
buying its own
o-o
dinos to give
o-o
the appearance
o-o
of extra customers
o-o
and income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's partly
o-o
why the deficit
o-o
is so huge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so the U.S.
o-o
government has
o-o
increased its debt
o-o
to compensate
o-o
for rough times
o-o
economically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a moment.
o-o
Our economy's
o-o
like a stack of
o-o
wood blocks in a
o-o
teetering tower
o-o
that's ready to
o-o
fall?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Almost all
o-o
nations and all
o-o
big businesses
o-o
are in debt.
o-o
So are farmers.
o-o
They all have to
o-o
borrow first
o-o
before they can
o-o
grow crops or
o-o
manufacture
o-o
or whatever to
o-o
get income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So being in debt
o-o
is not a big deal,
o-o
but a growing
o-o
deficit, that's
o-o
bad, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Relatively
o-o
speaking, yes.
o-o
But as long as
o-o
the government
o-o
is keeping its
o-o
citizens happy,
o-o
and happier than
o-o
in other nations,
o-o
problems can be
o-o
hidden behind
o-o
curtains of
o-o
distraction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The number of
o-o
people trying
o-o
to immigrate
o-o
into the U.S.
o-o
is still high,
o-o
right?
o-o
So that
o-o
suggests
o-o
success.
o-o
Yet things
o-o
are a mess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what should be
o-o
going on instead?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
History tells us
o-o
that prosperity
o-o
happens when a
o-o
city, nation,
o-o
or region
o-o
sells something
o-o
that people outside
o-o
the region
o-o
either need or
o-o
strongly desire.
o-o
And it's not
o-o
available from
o-o
anywhere else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
because,
o-o
well,
o-o
it helps.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Do you know what
o-o
the silk road was?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
Marco Polo
o-o
and lots of
o-o
caravans
o-o
traveled along
o-o
it to get silk
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
China was getting
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
things flowing
o-o
into their country
o-o
to pay for the silk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that made
o-o
China rich?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
China wisely
o-o
kept their special
o-o
silkworms within
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City to
o-o
protect their
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
Protecting a
o-o
monopoly
o-o
through secrecy
o-o
is an important
o-o
way for a
o-o
region or a
o-o
business to
o-o
dramatically
o-o
gain economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Forbidden
o-o
City's the fortress
o-o
where the emperor
o-o
of China
o-o
lived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Be the
o-o
only source
o-o
of something
o-o
valuable.
o-o
That's a
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
Hmm,
o-o
this seems
o-o
familiar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Another way
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity
o-o
is to increase
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How come
o-o
prosperity
o-o
increases
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No,
o-o
you've got it
o-o
backwards
o-o
in your head.
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
increases
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
again.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Consider the
o-o
Roman empire.
o-o
They wrote laws
o-o
to control
o-o
business and
o-o
commerce,
o-o
including setting
o-o
standards for
o-o
weights and sizes.
o-o
And they used
o-o
soldiers and
o-o
courts to
o-o
enforce those laws.
o-o
And they built roads
o-o
and patroled them
o-o
with soldiers.
o-o
They built aqueducts
o-o
to channel water
o-o
to cities.
o-o
All of that
o-o
greatly increased
o-o
the efficiency
o-o
of their economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
o-o
Economic
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Economic
o-o
efficiency
o-o
means something
o-o
different.
o-o
Here I'm talking
o-o
about efficiency
o-o
as a general
o-o
concept,
o-o
where profits
o-o
go up
o-o
when costs
o-o
go down.
o-o
Costs went down
o-o
when those
o-o
Romans wasted
o-o
less time
o-o
fetching water,
o-o
getting sick
o-o
because of not
o-o
having water
o-o
to wash
o-o
their hands,
o-o
breaking
o-o
ox hyphen-here cart wheels
o-o
on bad roads,
o-o
getting cheated
o-o
by merchants
o-o
who used short
o-o
yardsticks,
o-o
and getting robbed
o-o
by bad
o-o
Samaritans.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Less time wasted.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Especially
o-o
important
o-o
is for there
o-o
to be less
o-o
fighting.
o-o
Not only
o-o
physical
o-o
fighting,
o-o
but fewer
o-o
business disputes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since efficiency
o-o
is so important,
o-o
economists
o-o
measure it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
They think they do.
o-o
They have
o-o
something called
o-o
economic
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
but that's more like
o-o
the gain and loss
o-o
of a cherry pie.
o-o
And they have
o-o
something called the
o-o
productivity
o-o
index.
o-o
But it's flawed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
You do remember
o-o
some economics.
o-o
The productivity
o-o
index
o-o
is supposed to
o-o
measure
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which is similar
o-o
to efficiency.
o-o
Yet that index
o-o
increases
o-o
when a house
o-o
burns down
o-o
and then
o-o
inexpensively
o-o
gets rebuilt.
o-o
Of course it
o-o
would be even
o-o
more efficient
o-o
if the house
o-o
never burned down.
o-o
But measuring
o-o
non hyphen-here destruction,
o-o
alas that's not
o-o
a sexy topic
o-o
that attracts
o-o
economists'
o-o
attention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it fails
o-o
to account for
o-o
the benefits
o-o
of some kinds
o-o
of socialism,
o-o
like public
o-o
libraries,
o-o
and better
o-o
public
o-o
education.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if efficiency
o-o
is what made the
o-o
Roman empire
o-o
great,
o-o
why did it
o-o
decline?
o-o
In just a
o-o
sentence or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If all the books
o-o
on this subject
o-o
fell on you,
o-o
you'd get buried
o-o
in an avalanche
o-o
ten feet high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'll give you just
o-o
the relevant part.
o-o
After the years of
o-o
good governance
o-o
and
o-o
prosperity,
o-o
corruption grew.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This is going
o-o
to take awhile.
o-o
What I'm wearing
o-o
might go
o-o
out of style.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Actually
o-o
it's simple.
o-o
You know what the
o-o
free market is,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In an ideal free market,
o-o
there are no barriers.
o-o
People can choose
o-o
what to buy,
o-o
what to sell,
o-o
how much to charge,
o-o
and whatever else,
o-o
without fighting.
o-o
That's a fluid,
o-o
flexible,
o-o
and efficient,
o-o
economy.
o-o
But corruption?
o-o
That puts up barriers
o-o
that are chosen
o-o
to channel money
o-o
into specific pockets.
o-o
Those corrupt
o-o
barriers
o-o
reduce
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I've
o-o
got it.
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
and selling what's
o-o
desirable is
o-o
what brings money
o-o
into a region.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which causes
o-o
economic
o-o
decline.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In ancient Rome
o-o
a bigger source
o-o
of wealth was
o-o
through conquest.
o-o
That means stealing.
o-o
That's what brought
o-o
lots of
o-o
valuable
o-o
stuff into Rome,
o-o
from other
o-o
regions.
end-lyric

But that ends
o-o
when there's
o-o
no more regions
o-o
to conquer
o-o
and plunder,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Basically
o-o
that's the kids' book
o-o
version of the
o-o
Roman empire.
o-o
A similar kind of
o-o
rise and fall
o-o
pattern happened
o-o
later with the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
o-o
It started with
o-o
efficient banking.
o-o
Plus improved ships
o-o
using technology
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The compass, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the ship's
o-o
rudder.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the digit zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You're astute!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No my ass
o-o
didn't toot!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Astute.
o-o
It means your brain
o-o
just did the
o-o
equivalent of
o-o
a gymnastics
o-o
triple twist
o-o
vault
o-o
with a perfect
o-o
landing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh thanks!
o-o
And gunpowder
o-o
too?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Certainly
o-o
gunpowder
o-o
enabled seagoing
o-o
people to exploit
o-o
other regions
o-o
and their resources.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now that I
o-o
recognize
o-o
that using
o-o
big tall ships
o-o
to transport
o-o
silk and
o-o
other stuff
o-o
between
o-o
Asia and
o-o
Europe
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The other stuff
o-o
included
o-o
gold, salt,
o-o
ivory,
o-o
frankincense,
o-o
toga fabric,
o-o
and their
o-o
equivalent
o-o
of Reeses
o-o
peanut butter
o-o
cups.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
...
o-o
I realize that
o-o
running into
o-o
America and
o-o
taking land from
o-o
the natives,
o-o
and enslaving
o-o
Africans to work
o-o
on plantations
o-o
in the Caribbean,
o-o
was an
o-o
economic
o-o
bonus.
o-o
And giving
o-o
religious folks
o-o
a place where they
o-o
could escape
o-o
competing
o-o
religions
o-o
was just, for us,
o-o
a lucky byproduct?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Basically, yes.
o-o
And it gave
o-o
democracy
o-o
a place to grow,
o-o
far away from
o-o
big armies
o-o
and navies.
o-o
The resulting
o-o
cooperation
o-o
among U.S. states
o-o
led to immense
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
It was so much
o-o
more efficient
o-o
than
o-o
hereditary
o-o
court appointments,
o-o
political
o-o
patronage,
o-o
guilds,
o-o
secret
o-o
societies,
o-o
and fraternal
o-o
organizations
o-o
that even then
o-o
did teamwork
o-o
building
o-o
through
o-o
drinking binges.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Corruption!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
those barbaric
o-o
traditions
o-o
can be seen as
o-o
corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And inefficient,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Very much so.
o-o
That's why
o-o
a couple
o-o
centuries later
o-o
Europeans
o-o
formed the
o-o
European
o-o
Union.
o-o
They abandoned
o-o
fighting between
o-o
Catholics and
o-o
Protestants.
o-o
They abandoned
o-o
fighting over
o-o
language
o-o
differences.
o-o
And they stopped
o-o
having food fights
o-o
about table
o-o
etiquette.
o-o
Instead they are
o-o
copying
o-o
the clear
o-o
success of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
that works so well
o-o
in the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said fighting
o-o
undermines the
o-o
economy.
o-o
Yet political hawks,
o-o
who are mostly
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
promote warfare
o-o
as a way to
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
And competition
o-o
between
o-o
nations,
o-o
and between
o-o
businesses,
o-o
is the basis
o-o
of prosperity
o-o
in a free market,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm lost.
o-o
I feel like I'm
o-o
in a maze and
o-o
someone turned off
o-o
the lights.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Competition
o-o
between
o-o
businesses
o-o
provides
o-o
motivation
o-o
to work hard.
o-o
But what gets
o-o
overlooked is
o-o
the teamwork,
o-o
the
o-o
cooperation,
o-o
between
o-o
employees.
o-o
And the
o-o
cooperation
o-o
between
o-o
citizens
o-o
within the same
o-o
nation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hmm.
o-o
So teamwork
o-o
is more than
o-o
touchy hyphen-here feely
o-o
games?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, employees
o-o
getting along,
o-o
who wouldn't
o-o
normally get along.
o-o
Like employees
o-o
ignoring
o-o
racial differences,
o-o
religious
o-o
differences,
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, and Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
ignoring their
o-o
differences
o-o
while at work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When these
o-o
conflicts
o-o
are ignored,
o-o
that's cooperation.
o-o
Ah, that increases
o-o
efficiency
o-o
begin-italics within end-italics the business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So cooperation
o-o
within a business
o-o
makes the business
o-o
strong,
o-o
so it can better
o-o
compete against
o-o
other
o-o
businesses?
o-o
The lights are
o-o
coming back on.
o-o
I think I see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So fighting
o-o
between groups
o-o
of people
o-o
inspires,
o-o
motivates,
o-o
cooperation
o-o
within each
o-o
group?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not a bad
o-o
simplification.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So a free market
o-o
is a good thing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A fully free
o-o
market is
o-o
impossible,
o-o
yet it gets tried
o-o
repeatedly,
o-o
and it fails.
o-o
Like the
o-o
Articles of
o-o
Confederation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Basically the U.S.
o-o
Constitution
o-o
is version two point oh.
o-o
The Articles of
o-o
Confederation
o-o
was version one point oh.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It failed
o-o
partly because
o-o
it asked each
o-o
colony to supply
o-o
soldiers and
o-o
weapons and such,
o-o
but there was no
o-o
negative
o-o
consequence
o-o
for the colonies
o-o
that didn't.
o-o
So the
o-o
Constitution,
o-o
among other
o-o
changes,
o-o
taxed the
o-o
colonies
o-o
to pay for one
o-o
big army
o-o
and navy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And air force?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wake up!
o-o
Time travel
o-o
hadn't been
o-o
invented yet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That cooperation,
o-o
among the
o-o
colonies,
o-o
was the opposite
o-o
of what
o-o
European
o-o
nations were doing,
o-o
which was fighting
o-o
each other
o-o
endlessly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that if there was
o-o
a fully free
o-o
market then we
o-o
wouldn't have things
o-o
like a military?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Or public schools,
o-o
food for the poor,
o-o
hospitals, or
o-o
orphanages
o-o
for little
o-o
orphan
o-o
Annies.
o-o
Those things
o-o
were created
o-o
by churches,
o-o
and promoted by
o-o
religions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Religion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Ancient priests
o-o
in Egypt earned
o-o
their grain and beer
o-o
by predicting
o-o
eclipses
o-o
so their boss,
o-o
the pharaoh,
o-o
could pretend
o-o
to be powerful.
o-o
And they
o-o
predicted
o-o
when the Nile
o-o
River would
o-o
flood and recede.
o-o
Plus each year
o-o
priests used
o-o
mathematics
o-o
and surveying
o-o
to lay out the
o-o
new farming
o-o
boundaries.
o-o
All of that was
o-o
like magic
o-o
to people who
o-o
didn't understand
o-o
astronomy,
o-o
weather, and
o-o
geometry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Galileo
o-o
was a threat to the
o-o
Catholic Church.
o-o
He showed that
o-o
science
o-o
was better than
o-o
priests
o-o
at those
o-o
brainy
o-o
skills.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And priests lost
o-o
lots of
o-o
credibility,
o-o
plus their lives,
o-o
during the
o-o
European
o-o
black death
o-o
by praying
o-o
for the dying.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And by failing
o-o
to cure the sick.
o-o
They prescribed
o-o
holy water,
o-o
prayers, and
o-o
a pilgrimage
o-o
to kneel before
o-o
the pelvic
o-o
girdle
o-o
of Saint Bernard
o-o
of Piddlesbourough.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those priests
o-o
would have flunked
o-o
out of
o-o
medical
o-o
school.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of what
o-o
was once done by
o-o
religion
o-o
has split into
o-o
science,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
public
o-o
education,
o-o
and
o-o
government.
o-o
Now,
o-o
as I see it,
o-o
the big barrier
o-o
against progress
o-o
for civilization
o-o
is our use of
o-o
very primitive
o-o
voting methods.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what would
o-o
happen if we,
o-o
the majority
o-o
of voters,
o-o
could elect
o-o
leaders who care?
o-o
How would those
o-o
leaders
o-o
change the U.S.
o-o
economy?
o-o
To make it fair.
o-o
I assume they would
o-o
increase our
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes they would
o-o
want to increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
As a start,
o-o
they would avoid
o-o
making big mistakes
o-o
other nations
o-o
have made.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Stupidity
o-o
at the national
o-o
level.
o-o
I don't feel
o-o
so alone.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When England
o-o
was prosperous
o-o
they raised tariffs
o-o
as a way to increase
o-o
their income,
o-o
or so they thought.
o-o
But
o-o
higher tariffs,
o-o
just like
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
only work if
o-o
there's a
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
That new barrier
o-o
gave Dutch people
o-o
a trading advantage,
o-o
because they had
o-o
lower tariffs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So higher tariffs
o-o
on English goods
o-o
motivated
o-o
other nations
o-o
to trade with the Dutch
o-o
instead of the
o-o
English?
o-o
Isn't that when
o-o
Dutch business
o-o
owners grew so
o-o
wealthy they bid up
o-o
the price of
o-o
tulip bulbs to
o-o
sub hyphen-here orbital
o-o
highs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And isn't that when
o-o
the Pilgrims
o-o
moved to Holland,
o-o
where the Dutch live,
o-o
so they could
o-o
escape religious
o-o
persecution
o-o
from the state hyphen-here run
o-o
church in
o-o
England?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If free
o-o
markets are great,
o-o
why don't we
o-o
have more of that?
o-o
'N fewer
o-o
monopolies?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Great question.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A free market
o-o
saves money for
o-o
lots of people.
o-o
But it decreases
o-o
income for
o-o
people who cling
o-o
to outdated ways
o-o
of doing business.
o-o
So naturally
o-o
wealthy business
o-o
owners pay
o-o
politicians
o-o
to keep the
o-o
status quo.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Status quo ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Means keepin' things
o-o
as they are.
o-o
I've been doing
o-o
some cramming.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
On the flip side,
o-o
a free market
o-o
increases wealth
o-o
for people who
o-o
innovate
o-o
instead
o-o
of cling.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is this why
o-o
Amazon

o-o
And why retail

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I've worked in

o-o
I had to

o-o
We wasted time
o-o
watching

suspicious

in case they did
o-o
petty theft.
o-o
And countless
o-o
customers
o-o
interrupted
o-o
me because
o-o
they were too

lazy to read

o-o
Especially

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Makes sense.
o-o
Amazon
o-o
eliminates

cash,

o-o
And looking at
o-o
the city

o-o
people driving
o-o
from houses
o-o
to restaurants
o-o
and back
o-o
to pick up

o-o
wastes lots of time

right?

Here in the U.S.
o-o
we have to buy sugar

we're wasting

o-o
So we should

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Monopolies
o-o
do reduce
o-o
this general

kind of

efficiency.
o-o
But some
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are needed,
o-o
such as for

making
o-o
strategic

things.
o-o
Like bombs,
o-o
social media

o-o
and animated

o-o
Decades ago
o-o
sugar was

a strategic

advantage.
o-o
That's why it's

got a monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Getting fat
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So goods and

There's something else

that shouldn't be

o-o
It's difficult
o-o
to measure,
o-o
so it's easily
o-o
overlooked.
o-o
Consider what

happened in Britain

o-o
It was popular for

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
They got slaughtered

o-o
Lots of knowledge

died with them.
o-o
What a waste.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And that caused a

bad feedback loop.
o-o
It reduced the

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so that's why
o-o
men in college

get excluded
o-o

o-o
I see.
o-o
Knowledge and skills

o-o
During the

o-o
lots of blacksmiths

died.
o-o
With them died
o-o
lots of valuable

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Jesters

In those times

What's that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's when Bagdad
o-o
was the center
o-o
of an empire
o-o
of people who
o-o
spoke Arabic
o-o
and followed
o-o
the religion
o-o
of Islam.
o-o
A wise ruler,
o-o
whose name I don't
o-o
remember ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
...
o-o
Harun al hyphen-here Rashid,
o-o
at the end of
o-o
the seven hundreds ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
...
o-o
collected books
o-o
and gathered
o-o
wise scholars
o-o
from around the world,
o-o
and paid smart people
o-o
to develop things
o-o
like algebra,
o-o
geometry,
o-o
and ...,
o-o
I forget what else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Medicine,
o-o
three D drawings,
o-o
robotic mechanisms,
o-o
papermaking,
o-o
and much more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that when
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
made its way
o-o
closer to Europe?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes, and why
o-o
Europeans
o-o
and we refer
o-o
to the digits
o-o
zero through nine
o-o
as Arabic
o-o
numerals.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus plus.
o-o
And that empire
o-o
became weak
o-o
as a result
o-o
of what?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Corruption
o-o
I'll bet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, including
o-o
a dismissal
o-o
of science.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
People who
o-o
dismiss science
o-o
are doubly stupid.
o-o
And I'll bet
o-o
some of them
o-o
are capitalists
o-o
who fail to see
o-o
that the loss of
o-o
science leads the
o-o
economy
o-o
into a death
o-o
spiral.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another bad
o-o
feedback loop.
o-o
Got it.
o-o
About
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
how come it
o-o
so often wins
o-o
against
o-o
knowledge?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Dictators
o-o
and wannabe
o-o
dictators
o-o
outlaw or
o-o
monopolize
o-o
knowledge.
o-o
When Mao Zedong
o-o
led China
o-o
he destroyed books
o-o
and banished
o-o
intellectuals
o-o
to manual hyphen-here labor
o-o
jobs.
o-o
That undermined
o-o
the economy.
o-o
After Mao died
o-o
the brightest
o-o
compliant ones
o-o
were allowed back
o-o
into science and
o-o
business,
o-o
and that shift
o-o
paid off.
o-o
But it didn't
o-o
restore all of
o-o
what was lost.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since
o-o
Europeans
o-o
got lots of
o-o
inventions
o-o
from China,
o-o
did earlier
o-o
Chinese rulers
o-o
do better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Chinese emperors
o-o
feared losing
o-o
what they called
o-o
the mandate
o-o
of heaven.
o-o
What we call
o-o
the right to rule.
o-o
Especially
o-o
they feared
o-o
natural
o-o
disasters.
o-o
That's because
o-o
too many deaths
o-o
caused by flood,
o-o
or pandemic,
o-o
or crop failure,
o-o
would lead to
o-o
rebellion and
o-o
revolution.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
Congress lost
o-o
the mandate
o-o
of heaven
o-o
long ago.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To prevent
o-o
catastrophes
o-o
Chinese leaders
o-o
hired and
o-o
promoted
o-o
based on
o-o
competence
o-o
instead of
o-o
nepotism
o-o
and favoritism.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's nepo...
o-o
whatever.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hiring family members.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't that a
o-o
no hyphen-here brainer?
o-o
Hiring based on
o-o
skills and
o-o
a good
o-o
word-resume no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Alas,
o-o
hiring
o-o
relatives
o-o
and friends
o-o
channels wealth
o-o
selfishly
o-o
for short hyphen-here term gains.
o-o
Instead of
o-o
wisely
o-o
for long hyphen-here term
o-o
gains.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Another
o-o
big loss of
o-o
efficiency is
o-o
mismanagement.
o-o
That's partly why
o-o
NASA lost
o-o
its ability
o-o
to make rockets
o-o
that can take
o-o
astronauts
o-o
to the space station.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And why now
o-o
NASA has to buy
o-o
passage for
o-o
astronauts on
o-o
Russian rockets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
On the topic
o-o
of Russia,
o-o
socialism
o-o
is what some folks
o-o
think would be
o-o
better than
o-o
capitalism,
o-o
but it's not.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I learned that once.
o-o
But when I try
o-o
to remember why,
o-o
what comes up
o-o
is something
o-o
about
o-o
chocolate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's because
o-o
free markets
o-o
more quickly
o-o
arrive at the
o-o
most efficient
o-o
networks and
o-o
interdependencies.
o-o
In contrast,
o-o
socialism
o-o
attempts to
o-o
control
o-o
markets
o-o
from the top down,
o-o
using quotas,
o-o
and penalties,
o-o
and fixing
o-o
prices,
o-o
such as the price
o-o
of sugar and
o-o
chocolate.
o-o
But those rules
o-o
can't change as fast
o-o
as what happens
o-o
at the bottom
o-o
of the economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wanna see
o-o
if I'm
o-o
understanding.
o-o
...
o-o
A free and
o-o
efficient
o-o
market's like
o-o
letting water
o-o
find its own way
o-o
to the ocean?
o-o
Instead of
o-o
trying to
o-o
redirect
o-o
rivers.
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a useful
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
And now,
o-o
finally,
o-o
you're ready to
o-o
understand
o-o
something
o-o
important
o-o
that doesn't have
o-o
a name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Bring it on!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's a very
o-o
effective
o-o
way for a
o-o
government
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
The first half
o-o
is to begin-italics decrease
o-o
taxes end-italics on
o-o
begin-italics business end-italics
o-o
activities
o-o
that are efficient
o-o
and bring a net flow
o-o
of money into
o-o
the region.
o-o
The second half
o-o
is to begin-italics increase
o-o
taxes end-italics on
o-o
begin-italics business end-italics
o-o
activities
o-o
that are
o-o
inefficient,
o-o
wasteful, or
o-o
plunder
o-o
the locals
o-o
in the style of
o-o
New Jersey
o-o
lawyers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So,
o-o
besides lawyers,
o-o
which
o-o
business
o-o
activities
o-o
are which?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's consider
o-o
some different
o-o
kinds of businesses.
o-o
How about farming?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That brings money in.
o-o
If the crops are sold
o-o
outside the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Which is part of
o-o
why farmers get
o-o
lots of special
o-o
government
o-o
subsidies.
o-o
How about manufacturing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That brings money in,
o-o
when the products 
o-o
are sold outside
o-o
the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought that
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses
o-o
were bad.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when the
o-o
industrial
o-o
revolution
o-o
began,
o-o
that was common.
o-o
Owners used
o-o
greedy shortcuts.
o-o
And still
o-o
there are some
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses
o-o
that treat laws
o-o
as if they're
o-o
optional
o-o
suggested
o-o
guidelines.
o-o
But today's
o-o
transgressions
o-o
are mild compared
o-o
to earlier times.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
A
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
business
o-o
doesn't need to be
o-o
bad.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If there were
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
for good
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses,
o-o
that would reward
o-o
them for
o-o
efficiently
o-o
hiring skilled
o-o
workers who
o-o
transform raw
o-o
materials
o-o
into valuable
o-o
products worth
o-o
lots of money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So software
o-o
businesses
o-o
would get lower
o-o
taxes too?
o-o
They bring lots of money
o-o
into the United States
o-o
from other nations,
o-o
and they just consume
o-o
electricity.
o-o
And they hire highly
o-o
skilled software
o-o
developers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great example.
o-o
How about mining
o-o
companies?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They bring lots of
o-o
money into the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But the U.S.
o-o
loses lots of
o-o
natural
o-o
resources
o-o
that future
o-o
generations
o-o
will come to miss,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Like Japan,
o-o
where they cut down
o-o
their forests for
o-o
firewood.
o-o
Now they buy
o-o
lots of timber
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
Or did back when
o-o
massive logging
o-o
was done in the
o-o
Pacific
o-o
Northwest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So mining and
o-o
timber businesses
o-o
deserve to pay
o-o
higher taxes,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics deserve end-italics
o-o
is judgemental,
o-o
so that's a matter
o-o
of opinion.
o-o
There might be times
o-o
when name-desha thinks
o-o
you deserve to be
o-o
spanked with a
o-o
wet towel,
o-o
but that would be
o-o
a judgement,
o-o
not a fact.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In this case
o-o
it's a fact.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
But, yes, if
o-o
mining and timber
o-o
industries export
o-o
lots of materials
o-o
now, then future
o-o
generations
o-o
will not have those
o-o
resources to
o-o
use, sell,
o-o
or waste.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Short hyphen-here sighted capitalists.
o-o
Speaking of that,
o-o
what's capitalism?
o-o
It's confusing to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's because
o-o
the word really
o-o
has different
o-o
meanings
o-o
in different
o-o
situations.
o-o
Of course textbooks
o-o
carefully
o-o
define it,
o-o
but those
o-o
definitions
o-o
use words that
o-o
don't fully capture
o-o
exactly
o-o
what it means
o-o
every time
o-o
it's used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which explains why
o-o
so much of what I
o-o
learned in school
o-o
now seems like snow
o-o
on a sunny
o-o
hillside.
o-o
It's long gone.
o-o
But this,
o-o
what you're
o-o
teaching us,
o-o
reveals
o-o
so many
o-o
secrets
o-o
that lie beneath
o-o
puzzling
o-o
mysteries,
o-o
of why things are
o-o
the way they are.
o-o
So I think
o-o
I'll remember
o-o
most of it
o-o
for a long time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's a joy to
o-o
really get to teach
o-o
what's important!
o-o
Now, back to what
o-o
doesn't have an
o-o
official name.
o-o
How about artists,
o-o
writers, composers,
o-o
and other people
o-o
who create things
o-o
that can be sold
o-o
for way more than
o-o
the cost of electricity
o-o
and art supplies
o-o
and creative software?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Clearly they deserve,
o-o
er, should get,
o-o
lower taxes on their
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's this called?
o-o
This thing of
o-o
imposing
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
on businesses
o-o
that efficiently
o-o
create things of value.
o-o
And imposing
o-o
higher taxes
o-o
on businesses
o-o
that waste resources.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Or don't attract
o-o
as much money
o-o
into the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The only name
o-o
I've heard is
o-o
begin-italics tax the takers
o-o
more than the
o-o
makers. end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I like that.
o-o
People like me
o-o
who wanna make things
o-o
would earn higher
o-o
wages because
o-o
of those lower
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And corporations
o-o
would pay much
o-o
higher taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some corporations
o-o
would pay higher
o-o
taxes.
o-o
Other corporations
o-o
create lots of
o-o
valuable products
o-o
and services,
o-o
and they would pay
o-o
lower taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which corporations
o-o
create value?
o-o
I thought that big
o-o
corporations
o-o
are predatory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Admittedly
o-o
big corporations
o-o
do tend to be
o-o
greedy.
o-o
Yet when a biz
o-o
is young
o-o
and small
o-o
and sparsely
o-o
funded,
o-o
it can't grow
o-o
if it doesn't
o-o
offer something
o-o
that benefits
o-o
lots of people.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I have my doubts
o-o
about that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are there
o-o
examples?
o-o
Something from
o-o
history?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when Google
o-o
started out,
o-o
it gave better
o-o
search results,
o-o
and fewer ads,
o-o
compared to
o-o
other search
o-o
engines.
o-o
Amazon
o-o
started as
o-o
a bookstore
o-o
that gave
o-o
beginning
o-o
book authors
o-o
a way to
o-o
bypass the
o-o
monopolistic
o-o
New York City
o-o
book publishers
o-o
who were
o-o
inefficiently
o-o
renting
o-o
New York City
o-o
office space.
o-o
Bank of
o-o
America,
o-o
when it was
o-o
started in San
o-o
Fransisco,
o-o
it catered to
o-o
the special needs
o-o
of wealthy
o-o
Chinese
o-o
Americans
o-o
in Chinatown
o-o
back when
o-o
other banks
o-o
shunned those
o-o
people as
o-o
customers.
o-o
What's important
o-o
to realize
o-o
is there are lots
o-o
of begin-italics small end-italics
o-o
corporations
o-o
you've never
o-o
heard of
o-o
that benefit
o-o
lots of people
o-o
in lots of
o-o
wonderful
o-o
ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like with
o-o
rich people?
o-o
Some are good,
o-o
and some are bad?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
o-o
And I'm glad
o-o
you see that
o-o
simply taxing
o-o
wealthy individuals
o-o
isn't the key.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I learned
o-o
they can hide
o-o
vacation
o-o
homes,
o-o
ego hyphen-here inflating
o-o
yachts,
o-o
and
o-o
rendevouz
o-o
condos
o-o
in the
o-o

o-o
n' trusts
o-o
they own.
o-o
So they can evade
o-o
individual
o-o
taxation.
o-o
'N exploit tax
o-o
deductions
o-o
in their
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it's harder
o-o
to figure out
o-o
which rich folks
o-o
deserve to be
o-o
wealthy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
None of them!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Can you not think
o-o
of any wealthy
o-o
people who deserve
o-o
to earn lots of
o-o
money for their work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My boss,
o-o
and other
o-o
owners of small
o-o
construction
o-o
businesses
o-o
like the one
o-o
I work in.
o-o
And maybe
o-o
Elon Musk
o-o
because he's
o-o
rocketizing cars
o-o
and car hyphen-here izing rockets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But he's a jerk.
o-o
And probably
o-o
his real reason
o-o
for going to Mars
o-o
is to evade
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
So was Bill Gates
o-o
in his early years.
o-o
Being a jerk,
o-o
I mean.
o-o
But here we're
o-o
just talking
o-o
about whether
o-o
they've done things
o-o
that strengthen the
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
Oprah Winfrey
o-o
deserves
o-o
her wealth.
o-o
And Stephen
o-o
Colbert
o-o
does because
o-o
he makes me
o-o
laugh about
o-o
the crazy
o-o
antics in
o-o
politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They're all
o-o
in the political
o-o
up, along with
o-o
us voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's hard to judge
o-o
which individuals
o-o
are in what
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up versus down.
o-o
It's easier to do
o-o
with businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With individuals
o-o
we just need to look
o-o
at how much they give
o-o
to politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Following the
o-o
flow of money
o-o
in politics
o-o
is like slicing
o-o
an onion.
o-o
There are lots
o-o
of layers
o-o
to cut through,
o-o
and it becomes
o-o
hard to see
o-o
because
o-o
tears come to
o-o
your eyes.
o-o
It's easier to
o-o
separate the
o-o
takers from the makers
o-o
in businesses.
o-o
We look at
o-o
what the biz
o-o
does.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What if the biz
o-o
does both?
o-o
Making and
o-o
taking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We can prorate it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Get professionals
o-o
to rate the
o-o
business?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Prorating.
o-o
It's another
o-o
kind of
o-o
division.
o-o
The math kind.
o-o
It involves
o-o
percentages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, OK.
o-o
But my brain's
o-o
startin' to drain
o-o
'cause this seems like
o-o
sorting peaches
o-o
from apricots.
o-o
Is there some
o-o
pattern?
o-o
I mean
o-o
for sorting
o-o
takers from
o-o
makers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In general the
o-o
spectrum from
o-o
makers to takers
o-o
would be something
o-o
like this.
o-o
It starts with
o-o
farming and ranching.
o-o
Then to manufacturing,

cooking, brewing,

software developing,
o-o
oil refining,
o-o
research if it isn't
o-o
market research,
o-o
and other such
o-o
making activities.
o-o
Then to

teaching and training.
o-o
Then to healthcare,
o-o
grocery sales,

meat packing,

canning,
o-o
and maintenance.
o-o
Then to shipping,
o-o
retail stores,
o-o
hospitality,
o-o
and more.
o-o
Then to advertising
o-o
and marketing.
o-o
Then finally to
o-o
banking, insurance,
o-o
legal services,
o-o
real estate developers,
o-o
logging, mining,
o-o
casinos,
o-o
alcohol
o-o
businesses,
o-o
and the
o-o
tobacco

industry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
o-o
Especially because
o-o
sleazy
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers
o-o
would be at the bottom
o-o
paying the highest
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
Now it's finally
o-o
so much clearer
o-o
who I should fight!
o-o
And how I can fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that better
o-o
voting methods
o-o
would allow us
o-o
voters to elect
o-o
politicians
o-o
who'd pass laws
o-o
that change business
o-o
taxes?
o-o
In ways that
o-o
would lead to
o-o
a stronger
o-o
economy?
o-o
So there's
o-o
a big flow of
o-o
money into the
o-o
United States?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And higher taxes
o-o
for businesses
o-o
that mostly earn
o-o
their money from
o-o
customers
o-o
inside the
o-o
U.S.?
o-o
Like law firms,
o-o
Wall Street banks,
o-o
and insurance
o-o
companies?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm not saying
o-o
what should be done,
o-o
or will be done.
o-o
I'm saying that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
would increase
o-o
if those changes
o-o
were made.
o-o
It would make
o-o
the cherry pie
o-o
so much
o-o
bigger!
o-o
Then everyone
o-o
can get
o-o
a bigger
o-o
slice.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N it would only
o-o
decrease
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for a few people
o-o
who earn their money
o-o
by owning
o-o
taker businesses?
o-o
That sounds great!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm ready for this fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey! I see a pattern.
o-o
The owners of
o-o
taker businesses
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
o-o
'N currently
o-o
their businesses
o-o
get so many tax breaks
o-o
they pay low
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
'N the owners
o-o
of maker businesses,
o-o
like the one
o-o
I work in,
o-o
'n the one
o-o
I'd like to build,
o-o
they're in the
o-o
political up.
o-o
Yet they pay high
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
'N get
o-o
few tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hey!
o-o
The economy's
o-o
like a bat
o-o
takin' a nap.
o-o
It's upside down!
o-o
We're taxin' the
o-o
fruitful makers
o-o
more than the
o-o
vulture takers!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes,
o-o
in some ways
o-o
the economic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see something
o-o
else!
o-o
Suppose law
o-o
offices
o-o
were taxed more.
o-o
Then lawyers
o-o
would earn less
o-o
than they do now.
o-o
That means some smart
o-o
pre hyphen-here law students
o-o
would abandon
o-o
their path to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs as lawyers,
o-o
and instead choose
o-o
career paths
o-o
that lead to
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
where their
o-o
salaries would be
o-o
better than now
o-o
because maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
would be taxed less.
o-o
That job migration
o-o
would use U.S.
o-o
brainpower
o-o
more efficiently,
o-o
for better
o-o
widespread
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the same thing
o-o
would happen with
o-o
people being
o-o
less attracted
o-o
to soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs on Wall Street.
o-o
But wait a
o-o
minute.
o-o
...
o-o
I think that might
o-o
mean a lower
o-o
salary for me
o-o
'cause I'm not
o-o
a smart guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Does this guy
o-o
really not know how
o-o
smart he is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He hasn't done
o-o
much reading so
o-o
he's not book smart.
o-o
But he's very smart
o-o
in common sense.
o-o
Which is all too
o-o
uncommon,
o-o
alas.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I'm so smart,
o-o
why'd I flunk
o-o
out of community
o-o
college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because you've got
o-o
a reading
o-o
disability
o-o
that schools
o-o
don't test for.
o-o
That makes schools
o-o
stupid.
o-o
Not you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My world's
o-o
so upside down.
o-o
In so many ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's fix that.
o-o
What's still
o-o
confusing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I still don't know
o-o
why so many
o-o
people say
o-o
it's easy to
o-o
earn lots of money
o-o
just by workin'
o-o
extra hard.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That was true
o-o
back in the
o-o
nineteen fifties,
o-o
sixties, and
o-o
into the
o-o
seventies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What changed?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Remember that
o-o
a big part of
o-o
World War Two,
o-o
in the nineteen
o-o
fourties, was
o-o
the bombing
o-o
of factories
o-o
and power plants.
o-o
That destroyed
o-o
lots of the
o-o
efficiency
o-o
that had been built
o-o
in industrial
o-o
nations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't feel
o-o
brainy,
o-o
'cause I don't
o-o
see your point.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here's a question.
o-o
Which nations
o-o
did not get
o-o
their factories
o-o
destroyed by
o-o
bombs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And Canada.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That gave the
o-o
United States
o-o
and Canada
o-o
a monopoly.
o-o
A huge monopoly.
o-o
What was it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Factories!
o-o
Manufacturing!
o-o
The entire world
o-o
had to buy
o-o
manufactured
o-o
goods
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
and Canada?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Right.
o-o
So what's
o-o
that mean?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Huge amounts
o-o
of money,
o-o
to buy those goods,
o-o
flowed into
o-o
North America.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N that
o-o
monopoly
o-o
ended when
o-o
other nations
o-o
built new factories
o-o
to replace
o-o
the ones that were
o-o
bombed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus again!
o-o
That's why U.S.
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
peaked in the
o-o
fifties and sixties.
o-o
That's when the idea
o-o
arose,
o-o
well resurfaced,
o-o
that anyone
o-o
could get rich by
o-o
working hard.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like when
o-o
there's a strong
o-o
enough updraft,
o-o
even slugs
o-o
can fly?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Be careful
o-o
where you're
o-o
standing when
o-o
that updraft
o-o
ends.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the
o-o
basic
o-o
idea.
o-o
When a nation
o-o
has lots of
o-o
money
o-o
coming in then
o-o
unemployment
o-o
is low
o-o
and wages
o-o
are high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So during
o-o
the fifties
o-o
and sixties
o-o
the middle class
o-o
was bigger.
o-o
That fits with
o-o
what I've heard.
o-o
Now that the
o-o
middle class
o-o
has shrunk,
o-o
working hard
o-o
to earn wealth
o-o
is just bunk?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's something
o-o
called the Gini
o-o
coefficient
o-o
that measures
o-o
income
o-o
inequity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It measures
o-o
wickedness?
o-o
I love it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You're thinking
o-o
of iniquity.
o-o
This is inequity.
o-o
As in
o-o
inequality.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The Gini
o-o
coefficient
o-o
started rising
o-o
in the late
o-o
nineteen seventies.
o-o
That's when getting
o-o
to the middle
o-o
class became
o-o
a tighter
o-o
squeeze.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's when
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics elections
o-o
became common!
o-o
'N that's when
o-o
more rich
o-o
Republicans
o-o
infiltrated
o-o
Democratic
o-o
primaries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's not just
o-o
a coincidence
o-o
is it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Now you're getting
o-o
to something I
o-o
don't know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So rising to
o-o
the middle class
o-o
based on hard work
o-o
is something
o-o
from the past?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because of
o-o
increased
o-o
corruption!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm not a
o-o
political scientist,
o-o
yet I can see
o-o
there's lots
o-o
and lots of
o-o
corruption in
o-o
the U.S.
o-o
And it's been
o-o
increasing.
o-o
But please
o-o
appreciate
o-o
that most other nations
o-o
are even more corrupt.
o-o
And never forget
o-o
that corruption
o-o
was worse in the past.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I need some
o-o
optimism.
o-o
Is there any hope
o-o
that the big
o-o
problems we face
o-o
can be solved?
o-o
Like global
o-o
climate change?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when horses
o-o
pulled wagons,
o-o
big cities faced
o-o
a big environmental
o-o
dilemma.
o-o
They predicted
o-o
that soon cities
o-o
would be knee high
o-o
in horse shit.
o-o
Yet that didn't
o-o
happen.
o-o
Not one bit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They failed
o-o
to predict
o-o
automobiles
o-o
would take over.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So our current
o-o
climate crisis
o-o
is like being
o-o
ankle hyphen-here deep in
o-o
horse shit?
o-o
Except it's
o-o
invisible?
o-o
This is
o-o
optimistic?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What
o-o
predictions
o-o
are we failing
o-o
to see?
o-o
What
o-o
solutions
o-o
can solve
o-o
our huge
o-o
crises?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Perhaps
o-o
the biggest
o-o
overlooked
o-o
solution
o-o
is pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
You already
o-o
know that
o-o
will fix
o-o
lots of
o-o
bad feedback
o-o
loops.
o-o
And that will
o-o
increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
Yet I've also
o-o
read about
o-o
some other
o-o
promising
o-o
solutions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What are those?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I've read
o-o
about fully
o-o
synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon
o-o
fuel,
o-o
thorium
o-o
nuclear
o-o
reactors,
o-o
a fully
o-o
phonetic
o-o
writing system
o-o
that will reduce
o-o
illiteracy,
o-o
new programming
o-o
languages
o-o
that will
o-o
simplify
o-o
automating
o-o
things online,
o-o
open patents
o-o
as an aternative
o-o
to monopoly
o-o
patents,
o-o
dishwasher hyphen-here sized
o-o
kitchen
o-o
appliances
o-o
that will do
o-o
food prep using
o-o
robotics
o-o
controlled by
o-o
workers in
o-o
distant countries,
o-o
and a
o-o
years hyphen-here in hyphen-here prison
o-o
movie and game
o-o
rating that
o-o
will reduce crime.
o-o
Plus I've got
o-o
some personal
o-o
guesses.
o-o
There will be
o-o
better
o-o
micropayment
o-o
systems that help
o-o
individual
o-o
entrepreneurs.
o-o
And there'll be
o-o
higher
o-o
taxes on
o-o
businesses
o-o
that have more
o-o
salary
o-o
inequity
o-o
between
o-o
executives
o-o
and workers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
o-o
It makes my
o-o
gutter cleaning
o-o
tool seem
o-o
smaller than
o-o
a bikini
o-o
on a beach
o-o
in Rio.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
How do you know
o-o
about these things?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I've seen some
o-o
movies about
o-o
...
o-o
oh.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I read.
o-o
It's a form of
o-o
time travel.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I read too,
o-o
but this is all
o-o
news to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I mostly read
o-o
non hyphen-here fiction.
o-o
I skip over
o-o
articles that
o-o
are judgements,
o-o
such as who's to blame,
o-o
or what begin-italics should end-italics be done,
o-o
or what celebrities
o-o
are promoting.
o-o
Instead I like
o-o
to read about
o-o
why things are
o-o
the way they are,
o-o
which includes
o-o
lots of
o-o
history.
o-o
And when there's
o-o
a claim for a
o-o
solution,
o-o
I just focus
o-o
on its
o-o
advantages
o-o
and
o-o
disadvantages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's blocking
o-o
those future
o-o
solutions from
o-o
happening?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Let me guess.
o-o
Feedback loops are
o-o
keeping those things
o-o
from getting
o-o
developed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus again!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So there's lots
o-o
of feedback loops
o-o
blocking progress.
o-o
What's the
o-o
feedback loop
o-o
that blocks us
o-o
from election
o-o
reform?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are many.
o-o
As you've discovered,
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is just one part
o-o
of a feedback loop
o-o
that keeps owners
o-o
of many big
o-o
businesses
o-o
in political power.
o-o
And they oppose
o-o
solutions
o-o
such as fully
o-o
synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon
o-o
fuel.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's synthetic
o-o
whatever?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
o-o
refers to gases
o-o
and liquids that
o-o
are chemically
o-o
manufactured
o-o
for use as
o-o
fuel.
o-o
The process
o-o
would use sunlight
o-o
as the
o-o
energy source.
o-o
It would get
o-o
carbon from
o-o
carbon dioxide
o-o
in the atmosphere ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which we have too much of.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
... and it would get 
o-o
hydrogen
o-o
from water.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So doing what plants do?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, but much more
o-o
efficiently.
o-o
Especially
o-o
compared to
o-o
using crops to
o-o
generate ethanol,
o-o
which involves
o-o
a few wealthy
o-o
people who
o-o
have a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
on ethanol.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If synthetic hydro ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
... is such a good thing,
o-o
what's blocking that
o-o
from happening?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's no
o-o
economic
o-o
incentive.
o-o
The people who
o-o
have the skills
o-o
to figure it out
o-o
cannot get paid
o-o
to do that
o-o
research.
o-o
And oil
o-o
companies
o-o
can earn more
o-o
money by
o-o
blocking that
o-o
research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, more
o-o
feedback loops.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Instead it's
o-o
the lack of a
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there something
o-o
from history that
o-o
would reveal
o-o
how to make
o-o
good changes
o-o
happen sooner?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When Kodak tried to
o-o
develop, so to speak,
o-o
color film for cameras,
o-o
their research labs
o-o
were only making slow
o-o
progress.
o-o
But two young
o-o
chemistry graduates
o-o
were making better
o-o
progress, so Kodak
o-o
hired them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What was the secret
o-o
that gave them an
o-o
advantage?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They were singers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The secret was singing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
At that time
o-o
color darkrooms
o-o
were completely dark,
o-o
so there was no way
o-o
to see a timer.
o-o
Yet the chemistry
o-o
was very time hyphen-here critical.
o-o
So they sang songs together
o-o
and used the timing of songs
o-o
as their timer
o-o
for chemical reactions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're saying
o-o
we need to
o-o
take up singing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It illustrates
o-o
that breakthroughs
o-o
often require
o-o
sub hyphen-here breakthroughs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So this means we
o-o
need to figure out
o-o
some kind of
o-o
innovation
o-o
that will help spread
o-o
the bigger
o-o
innovation
o-o
of fairer voting
o-o
methods?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Look for a way
o-o
to break the
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
that block fairer
o-o
voting.
o-o
Drill a hole through
o-o
the dam that
o-o
holds back
o-o
the flood of
o-o
fairness and
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
that
o-o
civilization
o-o
is waiting for.
o-o
Then voters
o-o
can elect
o-o
leaders who will
o-o
be begin-italics their end-italics puppets.
o-o
Until then
o-o
politicians
o-o
are the puppets
o-o
of the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
o-o
And typically
o-o
they earn their
o-o
money in ways
o-o
that've become
o-o
obsolete.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Any more tips?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
One way to fight
o-o
against bad
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
is to create
o-o
opposing
o-o
good feedback loops.
o-o
Especially
o-o
ones that increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
again.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Democracy
o-o
itself is a
o-o
feedback loop.
o-o
It yields
o-o
far better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
compared to
o-o
monarchy and
o-o
dictatorship.
o-o
That makes
o-o
oppressed people
o-o
jealous.
o-o
That jealousy
o-o
brought down the
o-o
Berlin wall,
o-o
toppled the
o-o
dictators in
o-o
eastern Europe,
o-o
and ended
o-o
the Cold War
o-o
against the
o-o
Soviet
o-o
Union.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow!
o-o
Jealousy
o-o
isn't always
o-o
a bad thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Feedback loops
o-o
are not always
o-o
bad?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good and bad
o-o
are just shortcut
o-o
ways to say
o-o
something
o-o
has lots of
o-o
advantages
o-o
or lots of
o-o
disadvantages.
o-o
But it depends
o-o
on who you are
o-o
as to whether
o-o
a change is an
o-o
advantage
o-o
or disadvantage.
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
that helps big
o-o
businesses
o-o
get richer
o-o
is good for
o-o
business owners
o-o
but bad for
o-o
their customers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, this is the
o-o
cherry pie
o-o
slicing
o-o
concept.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And a feedback
o-o
loop can be
o-o
both good and bad
o-o
for the same
o-o
person.
o-o
It's like when
o-o
Henry Ford
o-o
paid his workers
o-o
higher than
o-o
usual salaries.
o-o
That increased
o-o
his labor costs,
o-o
but those
o-o
employees
o-o
could then afford
o-o
to buy Ford cars,
o-o
which brought in
o-o
more profits.
o-o
And something
o-o
similar
o-o
happens when
o-o
employees
o-o
can afford
o-o
to buy shares
o-o
of stock in
o-o
the company
o-o
they work for.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So shareholders
o-o
are shooting
o-o
themselves
o-o
in the feet
o-o
by not
o-o
realizing
o-o
that the
o-o
employees
o-o
and customers
o-o
can be,
o-o
or are,
o-o
also
o-o
shareholders
o-o
of their
o-o
company.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow, so many
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to learn about.
o-o
And yet
o-o
I've played
o-o
computer games
o-o
that took longer
o-o
to learn about
o-o
than what
o-o
I've learned
o-o
today.
o-o
About the
o-o
real hyphen-here world
o-o
economic
o-o
game.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your insights
o-o
are amazing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But my head is full!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To help you see
o-o
how it all fits
o-o
together,
o-o
here's a thought.
o-o
Voting,
o-o
and taxes,
o-o
and subsidies,
o-o
and legal
o-o
monopolies,
o-o
and even jail time,
o-o
are all forms of
o-o
communication.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can see that
o-o
voters try to
o-o
use their ballot
o-o
to say we want
o-o
more of this,
o-o
and less of that.
o-o
Alas, it's still
o-o
at the
o-o
mumbling stage
o-o
of communication.
o-o
But taxes,
o-o
how is that
o-o
communication?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see!
o-o
It's a way
o-o
government
o-o
can use lower
o-o
taxes to say
o-o
let's have
o-o
more farming,
o-o
more stockpiled
o-o
emergency
o-o
supplies,
o-o
and more
o-o
international
o-o
sales of apps that
o-o
play stupidly
o-o
funny games
o-o
with pigs.
o-o
Higher taxes
o-o
on some
o-o
businesses
o-o
could say we need
o-o
fewer pirates
o-o
on Wall Street,
o-o
and fewer
o-o
businesses
o-o
that overpay
o-o
executives
o-o
while
o-o
underpaying
o-o
workers.
o-o
And Wall Street
o-o
executives
o-o
never going
o-o
to jail
o-o
gives the thumbs up
o-o
to financial
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, that makes sense.
o-o
Now hopefully
o-o
I can better
o-o
figure out how
o-o
to earn money
o-o
as an entrepreneur.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To do that
o-o
you need to
o-o
understand
o-o
an important
o-o
business
o-o
concept.
o-o
So here's a test.
o-o
But don't
o-o
get stressed.
o-o
It'll
o-o
stretch
o-o
your mind.
o-o
What do these
o-o
people have
o-o
in common?
o-o
Steve Jobs,
o-o
Bill Gates,
o-o
Elon Musk,
o-o
Thomas Edison,
o-o
George Westinghouse,
o-o
and
o-o
Giovanni Marconi.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They are, or were,
o-o
rich entrepreneurs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They got rich
o-o
through tech.
o-o
Technology.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's all my brain
o-o
can guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This isn't something
o-o
I ever learned.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They profited
o-o
from technology
o-o
that was created
o-o
by creative
o-o
geniuses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah yes.
o-o
Steve Jobs
o-o
co hyphen-here founded
o-o
Apple with
o-o
another guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Steve Wozniak,
o-o
who designed
o-o
and built
o-o
the circuit board
o-o
for what could
o-o
have been called the
o-o
Apple One.
o-o
And Apple hired
o-o
Jony Ive
o-o
who is a design
o-o
genius.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Bill Gates
o-o
co hyphen-here founded
o-o
Microsoft with
o-o
another guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, Paul Allen.
o-o
They bought code
o-o
and renamed it
o-o
Microsoft
o-o
DOS,
o-o
so there were
o-o
creators
o-o
behind that
o-o
product.
o-o
Later there were
o-o
more creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
behind
o-o
Microsoft
o-o
Windows.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But not the
o-o
stupid ones
o-o
who put gaping
o-o
security holes
o-o
in it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Elon Musk
o-o
has hired lots
o-o
and lots of
o-o
really smart
o-o
engineers and
o-o
software coders.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And now the
o-o
trick part of
o-o
the question.
o-o
Who are the
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who created
o-o
amazing
o-o
technology
o-o
breakthroughs for
o-o
Thomas Edison,
o-o
and George
o-o
Westinghouse,
o-o
and
o-o
Giovanni
o-o
Marconi?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I only know
o-o
one of those.
o-o
Nikola Tesla.
o-o
He helped
o-o
Westinghouse
o-o
with electrical
o-o
power stuff.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed,
o-o
he almost
o-o
single hyphen-here handedly
o-o
designed our
o-o
electrical
o-o
power grid system.
o-o
Yet Tesla also
o-o
invented
o-o
key parts of
o-o
radio
o-o
technology
o-o
that Marconi
o-o
commercialized.
o-o
And Tesla
o-o
also did some
o-o
inventing for
o-o
Thomas Edison.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So why doesn't
o-o
history
o-o
teach more about
o-o
people like
o-o
Tesla?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Who's got the
o-o
money it takes
o-o
to erect statues,
o-o
produce
o-o
biographic
o-o
documentaries,
o-o
and archive
o-o
the person's
o-o
scribbled
o-o
notes on
o-o
napkins?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The people
o-o
who win
o-o
economically.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who do the work
o-o
get left out.
o-o
Both from profits
o-o
and historical
o-o
recognition.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's why I said
o-o
the important
o-o
part of history
o-o
is understanding
o-o
cause and effect.
o-o
And now do you see
o-o
what you should know
o-o
about entrepreneurs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Alongside,
o-o
or behind,
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Or underneath,
o-o
getting stepped on.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK,
o-o
underneath
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
are the
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who create things
o-o
of value that
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
sell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
And after
o-o
creating the
o-o
innovation
o-o
that starts the
o-o
business,
o-o
those creators
o-o
need to
o-o
create yet more
o-o
innovations.
o-o
That keeps the
o-o
business
o-o
ahead of
o-o
copycat
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is this like
o-o
Walt Disney?
o-o
He created
o-o
lots of
o-o
innovations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Excellent
o-o
example.
o-o
In his case his
o-o
brother Roy
o-o
handled the
o-o
money biz.
o-o
So having
o-o
a source of
o-o
great ideas
o-o
that become
o-o
innovations
o-o
can be a
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
Especially
o-o
if competing
o-o
businesses
o-o
don't have
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
working
o-o
for them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, the
o-o
ethical
o-o
kind of
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe now you can
o-o
figure out how
o-o
you can make
o-o
money from your
o-o
invention.
o-o
Maybe by teaming up
o-o
with an entrepreneur.
o-o
You would be
o-o
the creative
o-o
genius.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I could get
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It takes
o-o
lots of money
o-o
to protect
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought
o-o
getting a patent
o-o
was the hard part.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's just a start.
o-o
If it's a
o-o
valuable
o-o
idea
o-o
then other
o-o
businesses
o-o
will infringe on
o-o
your patent.
o-o
So you have to
o-o
take them to court
o-o
to protect your
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
And patent laws
o-o
favor big
o-o
corporations.
o-o
And China
o-o
mostly
o-o
ignores
o-o
patents.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sucks.
o-o
Is there a way
o-o
to ...,
o-o
I don't know,
o-o
to win in
o-o
the business
o-o
world?
o-o
For someone
o-o
like me?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The open patent
o-o
I mentioned
o-o
would help.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If it existed
o-o
you could afford
o-o
to register
o-o
your idea with
o-o
the patent office
o-o
without mortgaging
o-o
your house to pay
o-o
for a patent
o-o
attorney.
o-o
You'd get a
o-o
patent number.
o-o
You'd add it to
o-o
your LinkedIn
o-o
profile.
o-o
Then
o-o
corporations
o-o
would compete
o-o
to hire you
o-o
to invent
o-o
yet more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
At a big salary!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That path doesn't
o-o
yet exist.
o-o
So what should
o-o
I do?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Currently
o-o
corporations
o-o
don't know how to
o-o
hire, or even
o-o
recognize,
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses.
o-o
Not until
o-o
after they've
o-o
been the
o-o
co hyphen-here founder of
o-o
a wildly
o-o
successful
o-o
start up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a very
o-o
tall wall
o-o
to climb.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, alas.
o-o
Under current
o-o
conditions
o-o
only hindsight
o-o
reveals who's
o-o
a creative
o-o
genius.
o-o
When that
o-o
inefficiency
o-o
gets solved,
o-o
that will increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
so dramatically
o-o
that it will change
o-o
the economy
o-o
from a roller
o-o
coaster ride
o-o
into a rocket
o-o
ship blasting
o-o
into outer
o-o
space.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't most people
o-o
creative?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's like with art.
o-o
Thousands of
o-o
painters
o-o
have painted
o-o
portraits in
o-o
very creative
o-o
styles.
o-o
But the
o-o
Mona Lisa
o-o
stands out
o-o
as a style
o-o
that's not just
o-o
different.
o-o
It's also widely
o-o
appreciated
o-o
by millions
o-o
of people.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, that's why
o-o
you use the word
o-o
genius
o-o
after the word
o-o
creative?
o-o
'Cause the word
o-o
creative just
o-o
means different?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
alas,
o-o
most business
o-o
managers
o-o
don't understand
o-o
the different
o-o
meanings of
o-o
the word
o-o
creative.
o-o
And the word
o-o
innovation
o-o
also gets
o-o
misunderstood.
o-o
The value
o-o
of a product
o-o
or a person
o-o
becomes clear
o-o
only in hindsight,
o-o
not at the time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So solutions
o-o
are waiting
o-o
for when there's less
o-o
stupidity
o-o
in politics,
o-o
business, and
o-o
management.
o-o
That's a
o-o
zit hyphen-here sized
o-o
light
o-o
at the end of
o-o
a marathon hyphen-here long
o-o
tunnel.
o-o
Is there any hope?
o-o
For a fairer
o-o
economy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Look at history.
o-o
Civilization
o-o
has increased
o-o
efficiency
o-o
so much that
o-o
us average
o-o
folks don't waste
o-o
big parts of

our day
o-o
hauling water,
o-o
gathering firewood,
o-o
tending horses,
o-o
and pounding
o-o

o-o
Now we waste
o-o
too much time
o-o
sitting in cars,
o-o
working in the
o-o
kitchen,
o-o
watching
o-o

o-o
Those time wasters
o-o
and other
o-o
inefficiencies
o-o
in the economy
o-o
will disappear
o-o
after we adopt

o-o
But that requires

better

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm discouraged

by the setbacks.
o-o
The ones going on

o-o
politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In the past
o-o
there've been
o-o
huge setbacks too.
o-o
Much bigger ones.
o-o
The ancient Greeks

One of those

o-o
Antikythera.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Who was the
o-o
creative genius
o-o
behind that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Probably either
o-o
Posidonius
o-o
or Hipparchus.
o-o
Sadly,
o-o
warfare killed
o-o
their knowledge.
o-o
Those kinds of
o-o
mechanisms
o-o
weren't

developed

again
o-o
until the

Islamic

Golden Age.
o-o
In a similar way,
o-o
the footsteps

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's so sad.

Yet when times

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Solutions

o-o
World war three
o-o
is widely
o-o

o-o
a very stupid

idea,
o-o
for self hyphen-here interest
o-o
reasons.
o-o
So there's time
o-o
to get
o-o
pairwise
o-o

elections.
o-o
And doing that
o-o
should be
o-o
easier than
o-o
what early
o-o
North American
o-o
colonists
o-o
had to do
o-o
to get
o-o
democracy.
o-o
They had to fight
o-o
with physical
o-o
weapons.
o-o
And they won
o-o
mostly because
o-o
France and Spain
o-o
and the Dutch
o-o
all fought against
o-o
England at
o-o
the same time
o-o
the thirteen

o-o
Now the fights

occur in

o-o
Those fights
o-o
don't risk

o-o
And they're

winnable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I think I see

some light ahead.
o-o
You've shown us

o-o
I guess we just

o-o
The ones that

so much wisdom.

Ah, if only
o-o
more people
o-o
were anxious
o-o
to learn like
o-o
you two are.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What a pleasure!
o-o
So how can we
o-o
repay you?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Make the world
o-o
a better place
o-o
for my grandchildren.
o-o
And get it right!
o-o
Less corruption
o-o
would help
o-o
nearly everyone.
o-o
And the few who
o-o
lose will still
o-o
have their huge
o-o
bank accounts,
o-o
so they and their
o-o
families won't
o-o
suffer.
o-o
And then it will
o-o
spread to other
o-o
countries around
o-o
the world where
o-o
suffering is
o-o
even worse.
o-o
And that will help
o-o
the children of
o-o
my nieces and
o-o
nephews.
o-o
They live in India.
o-o
In advance
o-o
thank you for
o-o
helping their
o-o
offspring
o-o
and mine.

We will fight
o-o
to turn the world
o-o
rightside up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yes,
o-o
we'll do our best
o-o
to turn the worlds
o-o
of politics
o-o
and economics
o-o
and business
o-o
rightside up.

This was well worth
o-o
the three hyphen-here hour drive
o-o
to come meet
o-o
with you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good luck!
o-o
You'll need it.
o-o
And remember that
o-o
you didn't learn
o-o
any of this from me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We know how this works,
o-o
so we promise!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for the
o-o
master class
o-o
in restoring
o-o
the middle class.
o-o
And name-desha no-space ,
o-o
let's talk this stuff over
o-o
on the ride back home,
o-o
shall we?
o-o
So it remains
o-o
inside
o-o
our brains.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That plus more
o-o
espresso
o-o
should keep us
o-o
sleepless.
o-o
And what else
o-o
would we want
o-o
to discuss?
