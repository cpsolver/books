Hi professor
o-o
name-mathprof no-space .
o-o
This is name-damien no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof-firstuse amenn
Welcome name-desha
o-o
and name-damien no-space .
o-o
Let's go into
o-o
the classroom
o-o
to talk.
o-o
By the way,
o-o
name-damien no-space ,
o-o
do you like
o-o
pi?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien-firstuse amenn
In the morning
o-o
pie seems so
o-o
irrational.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So you do like math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Already I'm confused.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Let's keep it real.
o-o
He doesn't know
o-o
about those
o-o
special meanings
o-o
for pi and
o-o
irrational
o-o
in the
o-o
math world.
o-o
Just assume
o-o
he knows
o-o
as much
o-o
about math
o-o
as Mozart
o-o
knew about
o-o
...
o-o
electronics.
o-o
Plus he has
o-o
a phobia
o-o
about
o-o
fractions.
o-o
That's
o-o
name-damien no-space .
o-o
I don't know
o-o
if Mozart
o-o
had that fear.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Classrooms
o-o
are scary,
o-o
spooky, 'n
o-o
terrifyin'.
o-o
This one's bringin'
o-o
back awful
o-o
memories
o-o
of bein' teased
o-o
for gettin' Cs,
o-o
'n Ds,
o-o
'specially
o-o
in math 'n
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I bet you're smart.
o-o
You just didn't
o-o
get a good start.
o-o
Can you count?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
One two three four
o-o
'n of course there's more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Can you go
o-o
the other way?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Four three two one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What comes after
o-o
one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Nothin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a way you're
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
bein' polite
o-o
in sayin' I'm wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What's nothing called
o-o
in math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah yes, wonderful
o-o
magical zero!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's so special
o-o
'bout zero?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Zero as a digit
o-o
was not known in
o-o
ancient Egypt,
o-o
Babylon, Greece,
o-o
and Rome.
o-o
But in ancient
o-o
China they put
o-o
their counting marks
o-o
inside a square.
o-o
So when no marks
o-o
are there,
o-o
it's an empty
o-o
square.
o-o
That changed to
o-o
a circle as
o-o
the idea spread
o-o
to India then
o-o
Arabic-speaking
o-o
universities.
o-o
And then a student
o-o
took it to Rome
o-o
and became pope.
o-o

combee ************
Pope Sylvestor II aka Gerbert of Aurillac brought decimal notation and calculation procedures to Europe, and he became pope in year 999.
************ comenn

He could
o-o
calculate
o-o
faster than the
o-o
Italians who
o-o
still used
o-o
counting marks,
o-o
the ones we call
o-o
Roman numerals.
o-o
That's how the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
became part
o-o
of the Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's when
o-o
Leonardo
o-o
painted the
o-o
Mona Lisa,
o-o
and Michelangelo
o-o
carved the
o-o
rock hyphen-here hard
o-o
anatomy of
o-o
David.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lisa and David.
o-o
I think I've
o-o
heard about
o-o
those two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With that
o-o
digit zero,
o-o
sailors made
o-o
realistic maps,
o-o
and navigated
o-o
far out into
o-o
the Atlantic.
o-o
That avoided
o-o
the north hyphen-here bound winds
o-o
that block the path
o-o
along the south coast
o-o
of Africa.
o-o
That path,
o-o
which bumped
o-o
into Brazil,
o-o
took them around
o-o
the southern tip
o-o
of Africa.
o-o
With that sea route
o-o
Europeans
o-o
bypassed the
o-o
monopoly that
o-o
Arabic-speaking
o-o
Muslims had
o-o
on the land hyphen-here based
o-o
silk road to China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So it was
o-o
the digit zero,
o-o
not Columbus,
o-o
that got us
o-o
to North
o-o
and South
o-o
America?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes, in fact,
o-o
the Portuguese
o-o
discovered
o-o
Brazil before
o-o
fourteen ninety two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so that's why
o-o
people in Brazil
o-o
speak Portuguese
o-o
instead of Spanish.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Interesting!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, zero's
o-o
a big hyphen-here deal number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The digit zero.
o-o
Not just zero.
o-o
There have always
o-o
been words like
o-o
none, empty,
o-o
nobody,
o-o
ziltch, naked,
o-o
hungry, and
o-o
moron.
o-o
But writing
o-o
four zero zero
o-o
instead of
o-o
C C C C,
o-o
that's magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the digit zero's
o-o
a big deal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Without it
o-o
bridges would
o-o
be filled with
o-o
long lines of
o-o
accountants
o-o
...
o-o
waiting for
o-o
their turn to
o-o
jump off.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Without it,
o-o
scientists
o-o
and engineers
o-o
couldn't have put
o-o
a man on the moon,
o-o
or put rovers
o-o
on the
o-o
planet Mars,
o-o
or photographed
o-o
the rings of Saturn
o-o
from within
o-o
those rings.
o-o
And those are just
o-o
a few of the things
o-o
that make
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
so incredibly
o-o
fantastic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think my
o-o
confusions
o-o
'bout zero
o-o
are gone.
o-o
But how's that
o-o
relate to
o-o
what happens
o-o
in gettin' fair
o-o
elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's something
o-o
in math that's
o-o
still very new.
o-o
It's not yet taught
o-o
in public schools.
o-o
Yet it can take
o-o
civilization,
o-o
humanity,
o-o
us,
o-o
to the next level
o-o
where elections
o-o
are fair.
o-o
But to get there
o-o
you need to
o-o
appreciate
o-o
the power of a
o-o
name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, what's the name?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A name without
o-o
it's meaning is
o-o
useless.
o-o
Concepts come first.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Every test I took
o-o
cared more about
o-o
the names than the
o-o
concepts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I learned to spell
o-o
begin-italics hypotenuse end-italics
o-o
before I learned
o-o
it had nothing
o-o
to do with
o-o
hippos.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's because names
o-o
and dates and such
o-o
are easier to test.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't that upside
o-o
down? Testin'
o-o
what's less
o-o
important?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You seem to me
o-o
to be quite
o-o
intelligent.
o-o
So let's
o-o
eliminate
o-o
your fear of
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there a
o-o
rattlesnake
o-o
cage or
o-o
fallin' tree
o-o
nearby?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
also disliked
o-o
fractions.
o-o
And so did
o-o
the Romans.
o-o
It's because
o-o
they lacked the
o-o
digit zero.
o-o
That's no big deal
o-o
for addition
o-o
and subtraction
o-o
and multiplication.
o-o
Those are just
o-o
shortcuts for
o-o
counting up,
o-o
counting down,
o-o
and a skipping
o-o
version of
o-o
counting up.
o-o
But division,
o-o
without the
o-o
big hyphen-here deal zero,
o-o
that's muddled and
o-o
befuddled
o-o
confusion.
o-o
So leaving
o-o
numbers as
o-o
fractions,
o-o
without doing the
o-o
division it
o-o
signifies,
o-o
that's what they did
o-o
until the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
arrived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now we've got
o-o
zero,
o-o
the digit.
o-o
Yet I've gotta
o-o
use fractions
o-o
every day.
o-o
It makes me
o-o
wacko to
o-o
add 'n subtract
o-o
those
o-o
...
o-o
suckers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If fractions you
o-o
loathe, then this
o-o
question I pose.
o-o
Why do you use them?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's part of
o-o
my job.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Are you a musician?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's music
o-o
got to do with
o-o
fractions?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Musicians
o-o
cannot avoid
o-o
fractions.
o-o
They count
o-o
by two, or three,
o-o
or four, or six,
o-o
or eight.
o-o
But not by
o-o
five or ten.
o-o
Except,
o-o
I suspect,
o-o
for some
o-o
geeky
o-o
modern
o-o
jazz.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now we know
o-o
Mozart wasn't
o-o
fraction
o-o
phobic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I build custom
o-o
staircases.
o-o
Tape measures
o-o
are marked in
o-o
halves, quarters,
o-o
eighths, 'n
o-o
sixteenths.
o-o
Those effin'
o-o
fractions.
o-o
I'd murder
o-o
those suckers
o-o
if I knew
o-o
where to aim.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use decimal numbers.
o-o
That's what the whole
o-o
world uses, as part of
o-o
the metric system.
o-o
Except of course
o-o
here in the states.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can't use
o-o
metric units.
o-o
That'd get
o-o
me fired.
o-o
Inches and feet
o-o
are required.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Decimal
o-o
numbers work
o-o
with inches too.
o-o
Just get a
o-o
tape measure with
o-o
decimal
o-o
markings for
o-o
inches!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, if only
o-o
I could do so.
o-o
That'd be great!
o-o
I could avoid
o-o
the fractions
o-o
I hate!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here, look at this
o-o
tape measure.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, it's marked
o-o
with ten units
o-o
per inch!
o-o
When I measure
o-o
I could write the
o-o
numbers as tenths
o-o
or hundredths.
o-o
'N it shows
o-o
eighths as well.
o-o
This is, well,
o-o
swell!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And adding and
o-o
subtracting them
o-o
is as easy as
o-o
dollars and cents.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So a fraction
o-o
is a
o-o
division
o-o
problem
o-o
unfinished.
o-o
It's waiting
o-o
to get
o-o
diminished
o-o
to a single
o-o
number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Using this
o-o
tape measure
o-o
would be a
o-o
pleasure.
o-o
How do I get
o-o
one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use the magic
o-o
math word
o-o
begin-italics decimal end-italics
o-o
when you search for
o-o
begin-italics tape measure end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
words can be
o-o
powerful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You learn fast!
o-o
Now about your
o-o
fear of
o-o
fractions.
o-o
Ancient Romans,
o-o
even though they
o-o
fearlessly
o-o
conquered most
o-o
Mediterranean
o-o
waterfront
o-o
property,
o-o
they too had
o-o
that fear.
o-o
They liked the
o-o
number twelve.
o-o
That's why sundials
o-o
have twelve marks
o-o
for the day.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So that's why we have
o-o
twenty four hours
o-o
per day?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
o-o
The number twelve
o-o
can be divided
o-o
by two and three
o-o
and four and six,
o-o
and yield a nice
o-o
result of
o-o
six or four or
o-o
three or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wondered why
o-o
time is measured
o-o
in numbers that
o-o
aren't in
o-o
multiples
o-o
of ten.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sexagesimal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We're jumpin'
o-o
from fractions
o-o
to sex?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Using fractions
o-o
as foreplay
o-o
would solve
o-o
the world's
o-o
overpopulation
o-o
problem.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sexagesimal
o-o
is the name for
o-o
using sixty
o-o
as a base.
o-o
That's what the
o-o
ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
chose.
o-o
Sixty divides
o-o
without remainders
o-o
by two and three and
o-o
four and five and six
o-o
and ten and twelve
o-o
and fifteen and twenty
o-o
and thirty.
o-o
That's why an hour
o-o
has sixty minutes.
o-o
And why a minute
o-o
has sixty seconds.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So we could ditch
o-o
fractions?
o-o
That's a world
o-o
I'd like to see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So are fractions
o-o
a bit less
o-o
scary?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
my fraction
o-o
phobia's
o-o
takin'
o-o
a siesta.
o-o
But sometimes
o-o
I get stuck
o-o
not knowing when
o-o
to do division,
o-o
in the right
o-o
sequence with
o-o
addition 'n
o-o
subtraction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's just the trick
o-o
of algebra.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear lord
o-o
please forget
o-o
I said that!
o-o
From what I've heard,
o-o
algebra's
o-o
the fifth horseman
o-o
of the apocalypse.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Albert Einstein,
o-o
when he was young,
o-o
also had trouble
o-o
with algebra.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But he was a
o-o
genius.
o-o
And best known
o-o
for E equals
o-o
M C squared,
o-o
the ultimate
o-o
celebrity
o-o
math equation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He struggled
o-o
until his
o-o
uncle told him
o-o
to think of
o-o
algebra as
o-o
a whodunnit
o-o
mystery.
o-o
Where the
o-o
identity
o-o
of mister X
o-o
is unknown, and
o-o
the facts are clues,
o-o
and the goal is
o-o
to figure out
o-o
who is mister X?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Why didn't my
o-o
algebra teacher
o-o
teach that trick?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Because donning
o-o
a Sherlock Holmes
o-o
cap in class
o-o
would get you sent
o-o
to the principal's
o-o
office.
o-o
And writing
o-o
begin-italics whodunnit end-italics
o-o
on a
o-o
standardized
o-o
test would
o-o
get you sent to
o-o
the circus
o-o
as a clown.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, I think
o-o
I'm seein'
o-o
your point.
o-o
Division
o-o
asks the question:
o-o
begin-italics What number
o-o
needs to be
o-o
multiplied
o-o
times the number
o-o
on the bottom
o-o
of a fraction
o-o
to get the
o-o
number on the
o-o
top of the
o-o
fraction? end-italics
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes!
o-o
Excellent!
o-o
Now you
o-o
understand
o-o
some key ideas
o-o
of math.
o-o
Not enough
o-o
for me to
o-o
be inclined
o-o
to drive over
o-o
a bridge you
o-o
designed.
o-o
There's lots more.
o-o
And yet,
o-o
so much of it
o-o
would make sense
o-o
if math history
o-o
were taught
o-o
with a
o-o
focus on
o-o
concepts.
o-o
It even explains
o-o
why we say
o-o
fourteen and
o-o
thirteen but not
o-o
two hyphen-here teen
o-o
and one hyphen-here teen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I suppose
o-o
this explains
o-o
why hotel
o-o
elevators
o-o
can't count to
o-o
thirteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I sure feel
o-o
unlucky
o-o
when I'm stuck with
o-o
a measurement
o-o
of thirteen
o-o
instead of
o-o
twelve 'n have to
o-o
divide it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here's another
o-o
useful secret.
o-o
Division is
o-o
disguised under
o-o
other names.
o-o
Like ratio,
o-o
rate,
o-o
proportion,
o-o
average,
o-o
percentage,
o-o
percent, and
o-o
the word per.
o-o
And of course
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So a fraction's
o-o
just a lazy
o-o
way to deal with
o-o
division?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It sounds like we
o-o
need a revolution
o-o
in how math is taught.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another revolution?
o-o
How many do you want?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As many as it takes
o-o
to get things
o-o
right side up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh I do wish
o-o
there was more time
o-o
so we could talk
o-o
about beautiful
o-o
balanced equations,
o-o
and what's behind
o-o
calculus, and
o-o
why quadratic equations
o-o
....
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Fortunately
o-o
we don't have
o-o
that much time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course,
o-o
of course!
o-o
And anyway,
o-o
computers can do
o-o
math better than
o-o
students.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute!
o-o
Math textbooks
o-o
and math professors
o-o
are teaching us
o-o
thinking skills
o-o
that computers
o-o
can easily handle?
o-o
Why is that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ironic isn't it?
o-o
Computers are better
o-o
than humans
o-o
at spelling,
o-o
grammar,
o-o
arithmetic,
o-o
algebra,
o-o
trigonometry,
o-o
calculus,
o-o
historical facts,
o-o
geography,
o-o
map reading, and
o-o
diplomatically
o-o
insulting you
o-o
for missing a
o-o
right turn.
o-o
Yet we try to teach
o-o
all that in school.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What're computers
o-o
not good at doing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Inventing,
o-o
creating new
o-o
solutions to
o-o
real hyphen-here life
o-o
problems,
o-o
writing books
o-o
worth reading,
o-o
composing
o-o
beautiful music,
o-o
scripting videos
o-o
worth watching,
o-o
graphic design,
o-o
software development,
o-o
extracting meaning
o-o
from data,
o-o
creative things like that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Would that include
o-o
designing
o-o
custom staircases?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those are the skills
o-o
that employers
o-o
desire.
o-o
My boss says
o-o
it's hard to hire
o-o
workers who
o-o
can do much more
o-o
than loiter
o-o
in the general
o-o
vicinity
o-o
of a staircase.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So schools teach
o-o
what computers
o-o
can do better?
o-o
And schools fail
o-o
to teach the skills
o-o
that computers
o-o
are not good at,
o-o
but that
o-o
businesses
o-o
really want?
o-o
Wow!
o-o
The academic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
the
o-o
academic
o-o
world,
o-o
the one based on
o-o
standardized tests,
o-o
is upside down
o-o
for students
o-o
and teachers
o-o
and employers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No wonder I often
o-o
recall so little
o-o
of what I learned
o-o
in college.
o-o
Computers
o-o
do it better.
o-o
We really ought
o-o
to have a
o-o
revolution
o-o
in how math,
o-o
and more,
o-o
is taught.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Computers
o-o
lack the ability
o-o
to understand
o-o
concepts.
o-o
Yet too often
o-o
that's what's
o-o
academia
o-o
fails to teach.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So schools
o-o
deserve a
o-o
failing grade!
o-o
I love it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitions,
o-o
terminology,
o-o
memorization
o-o
of facts,
o-o
grammar rules,
o-o
math rules,
o-o
etcetera
o-o
are what professors
o-o
teach because
o-o
textbooks focus
o-o
on them.
o-o
And standardized
o-o
tests test
o-o
those things.
o-o
But really it's
o-o
the concepts
o-o
that schools
o-o
most need
o-o
to teach.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So schools are
o-o
trying to
o-o
begin-italics program end-italics students,
o-o
as if we were
o-o
computers.
o-o
While businesses
o-o
are trying to
o-o
begin-italics teach end-italics computers
o-o
how to think
o-o
like humans.
o-o
They're both
o-o
as stupid as
o-o
someone who brings
o-o
a kitchen knife
o-o
to a gun
o-o
battle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a dead end.
o-o
Now can we switch
o-o
to politics
o-o
from just
o-o
mathematics?
o-o
I'm eager
o-o
to learn the
o-o
math behind
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you're ready.
o-o
You won't be scared
o-o
when zero
o-o
pops up.
o-o
And only one
o-o
very simple
o-o
fraction
o-o
is involved.
o-o
The one called
o-o
half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hurray!
o-o
Even a half wit
o-o
like me
o-o
can handle
o-o
a half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's one
o-o
divided
o-o
by two.
o-o
That equals
o-o
zero point five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or fifty
o-o
percent.
o-o
Now you're ready!
o-o
So let's explore
o-o
how votes need to
o-o
be counted for
o-o
results to be
o-o
fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So how do you think
o-o
voting should be done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As you know,
o-o
I'm not a
o-o
math wiz.
o-o
Or even a nerd.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
name-damien no-space ?
o-o
What do you
o-o
suppose
o-o
that would
o-o
look like?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Uh,
o-o
...
o-o
I reckon,
o-o
...
o-o
maybe
o-o
...
o-o
it might use
o-o
...
o-o
five stars?
o-o
...
o-o
Like
o-o
Amazon does?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a good start.
o-o
And why is that
o-o
approach smart?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If Amazon used
o-o
just one star
o-o
for each product,
o-o
like on an
o-o
'lection ballot,
o-o
that wouldn't be
o-o
enough info.
o-o
So what's needed
o-o
in elections
o-o
is more
o-o
info.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Yes indeed!
o-o
So if stars were
o-o
used in elections,
o-o
and the highest
o-o
count of stars
o-o
indicated
o-o
the winner,
o-o
how could you,
o-o
as a voter,
o-o
get some extra
o-o
influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm feelin'
o-o
like a dunce.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's try a
o-o
different
o-o
scenario.
o-o
Let's suppose
o-o
you're in the
o-o
audience at
o-o
a talent contest,
o-o
and the emcee
o-o
announces that
o-o
the loudness
o-o
of clapping
o-o
will determine
o-o
who wins.
o-o
How can you get
o-o
extra influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nor do I.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You could clap
o-o
really loud for
o-o
your favorites,
o-o
and just pretend
o-o
to clap for the
o-o
others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be
o-o
cheating.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a talent
o-o
contest, maybe,
o-o
maybe not.
o-o
At theater
o-o
events, that's
o-o
disrespectful.
o-o
But in an
o-o
election, with
o-o
money on the line,
o-o
that's just freedom
o-o
of expression.
o-o
It's voting,
o-o
but with an unfair
o-o
kind of vote
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, it's fighting!
o-o
Done on ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So when I rate
o-o
things on Amazon
o-o
I should only
o-o
use one star
o-o
or five stars?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you do that
o-o
on Amazon
o-o
you're being a
o-o
jerk.
o-o
But if that star
o-o
rating were used
o-o
in elections,
o-o
where so much
o-o
is at stake,
o-o
that tactic
o-o
would make
o-o
your ballot
o-o
have more impact
o-o
than ballots
o-o
marked
o-o
honestly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm still following
o-o
things to here.
o-o
Too bad I can't
o-o
celebrate with
o-o
a beer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Bravo!
o-o
You see that
o-o
just collecting
o-o
more information
o-o
isn't enough.
o-o
How the information
o-o
is counted to
o-o
identify a
o-o
winner is so
o-o
important to
o-o
get right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the five star
o-o
method won't work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, I should
o-o
take a step back.
o-o
There are two parts
o-o
to any voting method.
o-o
There's the ballot
o-o
and there's the
o-o
counting of those
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What kind'a ballot
o-o
do we use
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost
o-o
every nation in the
o-o
world uses what's
o-o
now called the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'Cause we can
o-o
only mark a
o-o
single choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
o-o
And there's just
o-o
one way to count
o-o
that kind of ballot.
o-o
Which is why
o-o
until recently
o-o
that ballot didn't
o-o
have a name.
o-o
The counting method
o-o
has different names.
o-o
It's the enemy
o-o
of fair voting
o-o
so it's worth
o-o
learning its names.
o-o
In the academic
o-o
world it's called
o-o
begin-italics plurality voting end-italics no-space .
o-o
In Canada
o-o
and other
o-o
British places
o-o
it's called
o-o
begin-italics first past the post end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it called
o-o
here in the states?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's just called
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah! With no name
o-o
it becomes harder
o-o
to fight against!
o-o
Imagine protesting
o-o
with a sign that says
o-o
begin-italics End That Unnamed
o-o
Bad Kind Of
o-o
Vote Counting end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that's the
o-o
enemy?
o-o
Plurality?
o-o
And it uses
o-o
the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
It is to
o-o
democracy
o-o
what a string
o-o
and two old hyphen-here style
o-o
tin cans
o-o
are to the
o-o
telephone.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's so
o-o
primitive.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the name
o-o
of a ballot where
o-o
each candidate
o-o
can be ranked at
o-o
a different level,
o-o
like on Amazon?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Academically
o-o
that's called a
o-o
ranked ballot,
o-o
or a score ballot,
o-o
depending on
o-o
how it's counted.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain freeze
o-o
big time!
o-o
Is that difference
o-o
really of prime
o-o
importance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To get the math
o-o
right, yes.
o-o
But both types
o-o
are better than
o-o
what we use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't anything
o-o
better than what
o-o
we use now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost anything.
o-o
There's one
o-o
seductive
o-o
exception.
o-o
That's using points,
o-o
where each voter
o-o
is given a limited
o-o
number of points
o-o
to distribute
o-o
among the choices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that because
o-o
a jerk could give
o-o
all his points
o-o
to a single
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's one
o-o
of its flaws.
o-o
If vote counting
o-o
methods
o-o
competed in
o-o
a limbo contest,
o-o
the points approach
o-o
would win
o-o
the limbo
o-o
contest,
o-o
as the
o-o
lowest.
o-o
Anything else
o-o
is like
o-o
pole vaulting
o-o
over what we
o-o
use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So using ballots
o-o
that are like
o-o
Amazon stars ....
o-o
Wait a moment.
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
voting has to be
o-o
done electronically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That wouldn't
o-o

Of course

columns of ovals

Let's say there's

o-o
If everyone is

o-o
simple counting

works fine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Simple counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If there are five columns,
o-o
a marked oval
o-o
in the begin-italics first choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
five Amazon stars,
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics second choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
four Amazon stars,
o-o
and so on down to
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics fifth choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
one Amazon star.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's simple?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A computer
o-o
would take care of doing
o-o
that counting.
o-o
You would just mark
o-o
the correct column
o-o
for each
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Even hand counting
o-o
the ballots
o-o
that way
o-o
would be easy.
o-o
For simple counting
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the highest
o-o
such count
o-o
would win.
o-o
If everyone
o-o
is honest,
o-o
and ranks just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
at each level,
o-o
then that
o-o
works fine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Fat chance of that!

It seems to be

in business

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes when money
o-o
is involved,
o-o
as in politics,
o-o
then that simple
o-o
way of counting
o-o
ratings is
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to strategic
o-o
voters.
o-o
They can get
o-o
extra
o-o
influence
o-o
using the
o-o
clapping tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm curious.
o-o
What happens
o-o
when Amazon
o-o
customers
o-o
realize they
o-o
can get extra
o-o
influence by
o-o
skipping the
o-o
middle ratings?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Then Amazon
o-o
can move the
o-o
goalposts.
o-o
They can count
o-o
differently.
o-o
Actually
o-o
they already do.
o-o
They can get even
o-o
more sophisticated
o-o
if that's needed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

o-o
I understand

o-o
is such a
o-o
big deal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly!
o-o
A plus again!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how should we
o-o
be countin'
o-o
ballots?
o-o
For elections.
o-o
Where voters
o-o
will try
o-o
to increase
o-o
their influence.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Before we
o-o
move on to what
o-o
I think is the
o-o
best kind of
o-o
vote counting,
o-o
here's an
o-o
interesting
o-o
simple kind of
o-o
improvement.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Consider the same
o-o
kind of ballot
o-o
we use now, the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballot.
o-o
But change the
o-o
instructions
o-o
and allow the voter
o-o
to mark more than
o-o
just one candidate.
o-o
That's called
o-o
approval
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, because you
o-o
either approve
o-o
each candidate or
o-o
leave their name
o-o
unmarked.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This sounds like
o-o
Facebook,
o-o
where people can
o-o
upvote
o-o
anything and
o-o
everything.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're getting this!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On Reddit
o-o
we can upvote
o-o
and downvote.
o-o
That's more
o-o
info.
o-o
Is that
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only if it's
o-o
counted as
o-o
three ranking
o-o
levels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Three?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, an upvote
o-o
is like plus one.
o-o
And a downvote
o-o
is like minus one.
o-o
And neither
o-o
up nor down
o-o
is like zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If counted right
o-o
that could work.
o-o
But using
o-o
five levels
o-o
collects more
o-o
information
o-o
than three.
o-o
And when there are
o-o
lots and lots of candidates
o-o
then up to about twelve
o-o
levels would work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But not
o-o
unlucky thirteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since you
o-o
brought it up,
o-o
I'm guessing,
o-o
approval voting
o-o
might be fair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It would work OK in
o-o
begin-italics
primary
end-italics
elections
o-o
because the winner
o-o
would always be from
o-o
the correct party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But in general
o-o
elections,
o-o
the wrong party
o-o
must not win.
o-o
So there it
o-o
would cause
o-o
trouble,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
o-o
We need more
o-o
than just one
o-o
column of
o-o
ballot ovals
o-o
to avoid
o-o
criticism
o-o
of the results.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wait a moment!
o-o
Just changing
o-o
written
o-o
directions
o-o
on the ballot
o-o
would be
o-o
an easy change
o-o
to make,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I'm not
o-o
politically
o-o
savvy.
o-o
That's outside
o-o
my expertise.
o-o
I just know
o-o
the math behind
o-o
ballot counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If we're gonna
o-o
fight,
o-o
let's get it
o-o
right!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what's the best
o-o
way to count
o-o
votes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're finally
o-o
ready to
o-o
learn about 
o-o
ranking.
o-o
It uses
o-o
ranked ballots.
o-o
They look the same
o-o
as score ballots
o-o
with ovals,
o-o
but they're counted
o-o
differently.
o-o
It defeats the tactic
o-o
of just marking
o-o
the highest levels
o-o
and lowest levels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-explain Speaks to himself. end-explain
o-o
That's ranking.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
How can those marks
o-o
be counted
o-o
in a way
o-o
that holds up
o-o
under
o-o
scrutiny,
o-o
without
o-o
mutiny?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's harder than
o-o
any jigsaw
o-o
puzzle
o-o
I've ever
o-o
seen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Admittedly,
o-o
if I asked this
o-o
on a test
o-o
I might soon
o-o
be under
o-o
arrest
o-o
for cerebral
o-o
torment
o-o
without written
o-o
consent.
o-o
But take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Maybe
o-o
...
o-o
we could start
o-o
by looking at
o-o
...
o-o
just the top
o-o
part.
o-o
The top hyphen-here most
o-o
candidate
o-o
on each
o-o
ballot.
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Side step the fear
o-o
and persevere.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who gets the
o-o
fewest
o-o
top marks
o-o
...
o-o
gets
o-o
tossed aside?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Then the ballots
o-o
are modified
o-o
to hide the
o-o
one dismissed.
o-o
Then the process
o-o
repeats.
o-o
Until just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
remains?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That counting
o-o
method has
o-o
many
o-o
different names.
o-o
Here let's call it
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting.
o-o
Among friends,
o-o
or when a smartphone
o-o
isn't handy,
o-o
that method
o-o
is dandy.
o-o
It works well
o-o
enough that it's
o-o
been used in real
o-o
elections.
o-o
In fact it's used
o-o
in Maine, Alaska,
o-o
and Australia,
o-o
in San Francisco,
o-o
and a few
o-o
other places.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So I didn't
o-o
guess right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This is hard stuff.
o-o
Although
o-o
not as hard
o-o
as using an
o-o
abacus
o-o
to calculate
o-o
the square root
o-o
of your social
o-o
security
o-o
number.
o-o
Yet you deserve
o-o
another
o-o
A plus.
o-o
For the basic
o-o
idea of
o-o
using something
o-o
besides counting
o-o
marks and looking
o-o
for the biggest
o-o
count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Your reactions
o-o
are such a
o-o
contrast
o-o
to what
o-o
in the past
o-o
would have been
o-o
kicks in the
o-o
ass.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet this
o-o
counting method
o-o
is flawed.
o-o
Instant
o-o
runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
was used in
o-o
the city of
o-o
Burlington,
o-o
in Vermont,
o-o
and it failed.
o-o
And it failed again
o-o
in Alaska.
o-o
In those two
o-o
elections
o-o
the candidate
o-o
who won
o-o
was not
o-o
the one
o-o
who deserved
o-o
to win.
o-o
We can do
o-o
better.
o-o
So which
o-o
candidate
o-o
should be the
o-o
first to be
o-o
eliminated?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm stumpified.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've heard of the
o-o
electoral college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's garbage!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, but one thing
o-o
it gets quite right.
o-o
The winner
o-o
of the
o-o
electoral
o-o
fight
o-o
has to get
o-o
more than half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Here's the fraction.
o-o
A half.
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
my fraction fears
o-o
have disappeared,
o-o
...
o-o
for now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
More than half,
o-o
that's called a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If a
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a
o-o
majority,
o-o
then vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
o-o
That's so important
o-o
that Roberts
o-o
Rules of Order
o-o
have always
o-o
insisted
o-o
on getting
o-o
majority
o-o
support
o-o
to declare
o-o
a winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So getting more
o-o
than half the votes
o-o
is a must.
o-o
But how can
o-o
there always
o-o
be a
o-o
majority?
o-o
Especially
o-o
when there are
o-o
more than two
o-o
candidates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is hard.
o-o
Is it time
o-o
for recess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Remember that
o-o
business success
o-o
is your reward
o-o
for
o-o
sorting
o-o
this out.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In sports,
o-o
how are teams ranked?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't teams ranked
o-o
based on,
o-o
... well, ...
o-o
I think they get
o-o
points,
o-o
or maybe lose points,
o-o
from each game.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
How many teams
o-o
compete in each game?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Just two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And what's that called,
o-o
two at a time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Two at a time,
o-o
that's a pair
o-o
at a time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise.
o-o
That's the name.
o-o
So how would
o-o
that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Pairwise, ...
o-o
ah, counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
pairwise counting.
o-o
It's a very important
o-o
thing.
o-o
How would that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's counting,
o-o
but it's beyond
o-o
what my brain
o-o
can handle
o-o
begin-highlight
without an assist
o-o
from some
o-o
Brainiac
o-o
Elixer.
end-highlight
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If it were
o-o
sports teams,
o-o
then,
o-o
...
o-o
well,
o-o
a team would be
o-o
the worst
o-o
loser if
o-o
it lost all
o-o
its pairwise
o-o
matches.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Keep going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So the loser
o-o
of all the
o-o
pairwise contests
o-o
would get
o-o
eliminated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N then we'd
o-o
look for the
o-o
next loser,
o-o
from the remaining
o-o
teams, er,
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And when there's
o-o
just one team,
o-o
or candidate,
o-o
remaining, that
o-o
would be the
o-o
winner, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
That pairwise
o-o
elimination
o-o
process would work,
o-o
up to a point.
o-o
A better shortcut
o-o
approach is to
o-o
look for the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who wins all
o-o
of their pairwise
o-o
contests.
o-o
The academic
o-o
world calls that a
o-o
Condorcet
begin-explain pronounced cone-dor-SAY end-explain
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Condorcet,
o-o
that sounds stuffy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's named after
o-o
a French guy
o-o
whose title was the
o-o
Marques de
o-o
Condorcet.
o-o
For a long time
o-o
Europeans
o-o
thought he was the
o-o
first person to
o-o
publish a
o-o
description
o-o
of that method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I can see,
o-o
as you say,
o-o
the concept
o-o
is the key.
o-o
Yet on a test,
o-o
students would be
o-o
asked to recall,
o-o
or recognize,
o-o
his name.
o-o
That's dumb.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see.
o-o
A Condorcet winner
o-o
would get more than
o-o
half the votes,
o-o
a majority,
o-o
without any
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this is the
o-o
best way to make
o-o
selections
o-o
in elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sometimes
o-o
there's no
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner.
o-o
Using the elimination
o-o
approach, it can
o-o
reach a point where
o-o
none of the candidates
o-o
loses all its
o-o
pairwise contests.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Partial losers.
o-o
But no total
o-o
losers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what?
o-o
Count how many
o-o
losses?
o-o
Or measure
o-o
how big the
o-o
losses are?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A plus
o-o
for thinking
o-o
of those
o-o
ideas!
o-o
Actually
o-o
there are many
o-o
ways to resolve
o-o
those cases.
o-o
Even better,
o-o
there are methods
o-o
that don't first
o-o
look for Condorcet
o-o
winners or losers.
o-o
Instead they use
o-o
the pairwise counts
o-o
in ways that
o-o
don't need to do
o-o
anything
o-o
special.
o-o
Yet they find the
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner when
o-o
one exists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's
o-o
beautiful
o-o
advanced
o-o
mathematics.
o-o
After all,
o-o
magic is a
o-o
word for what
o-o
we don't yet
o-o
fully
o-o
comprehend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like how
o-o
my landlord
o-o
calculates my
o-o
utility
o-o
bill.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is there some
o-o
method you like,
o-o
that you could
o-o
explain,
o-o
in a way that
o-o
makes that magic
o-o
understandable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
But before that
o-o
will make sense
o-o
I should ask you
o-o
how many pairwise
o-o
counts are involved
o-o
in each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess two.
o-o
If the two
o-o
candidates are
o-o
named Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
there's the count
o-o
for how many voters,
o-o
well, support,
o-o
uh, Pinoke
o-o
over Oscar.
o-o
And there's
o-o
the other count,
o-o
of how many voters
o-o
prefer Oscar
o-o
over Pinoke.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And will those two
o-o
numbers always
o-o
add up to the
o-o
total number
o-o
of voters?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think so.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but what if
o-o
some voters rank
o-o
Pinoke and Oscar
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, that means
o-o
there will be
o-o
a third number.
o-o
The number of voters
o-o
who rank them
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Yes there are
o-o
three numbers
o-o
for each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
o-o
But when summarized,
o-o
the third count
o-o
can be omitted.
o-o
This means the
o-o
pairwise numbers
o-o
can be put into
o-o
a table, a square grid.
o-o
And each row
o-o
would be labelled
o-o
with the name
o-o
of a candidate.
o-o
And the columns
o-o
would be labelled
o-o
with the same
o-o
names in the same
o-o
sequence.
o-o
And each cell
o-o
would contain
o-o
a count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So if the
o-o
candidates
o-o
are named
o-o
Pinoke, Oscar,
o-o
Barack, and
o-o
Hypatia,
o-o
it would be
o-o
a four by four
o-o
grid, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
o-o
Now you're ready
o-o
to see the magic
o-o
of the counting
o-o
method I like
o-o
best.
o-o
It re hyphen-here arranges
o-o
the sequence of
o-o
candidates,
o-o
in the rows
o-o
and columns.
o-o
The goal is to
o-o
re hyphen-here arrange
o-o
the sequence
o-o
until the biggest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
upper hyphen-here right
o-o
triangular area
o-o
of the grid,
o-o
and the smallest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
other half,
o-o
the lower hyphen-here left
o-o
triangular area.
o-o
Then we look at
o-o
that sequence.
o-o
It indicates
o-o
not only who is
o-o
most popular,
o-o
but who is second
o-o
most popular,
o-o
who is third most
o-o
popular, and
o-o
so on down to
o-o
who is least
o-o
popular.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that method
o-o
called?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The Condorcet
o-o
Kemeny
o-o
method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That method
o-o
sounds more
o-o
complicated
o-o
than building
o-o
a staircase
o-o
down to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe that's the
o-o
kind of math
o-o
your landlord
o-o
uses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that the
o-o
fairest method?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Not always.
o-o
The very fairest
o-o
vote hyphen-here counting
o-o
system would be
o-o
even more complex.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So math
o-o
really is
o-o
the stairway
o-o
to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do math
o-o

o-o

mathematical

proof that proves
o-o
it's not possible

o-o
So it's complicated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Sounds like life and
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There are some
o-o
fairness
o-o
characteristics,

criteria,
o-o
that voting methods
o-o
pass or fail.
o-o
Math geeks know which
o-o

can sometimes

fail which criteria.
o-o
But there has been

no research

o-o
how begin-italics often end-italics
o-o
each method fails,
o-o
or rather
o-o
passes,

each one.

Of course the
o-o
people who have
o-o
power
o-o
don't want to pay
o-o
for research
o-o
that reveals the
o-o
unfairness
o-o
that underpins
o-o
their power.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A black widow
o-o
spider's web of
o-o
corruption!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think we've
o-o
learned what's
o-o
needed.
o-o
Ranked hyphen-here choice ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
counting.
o-o
So are we done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now math
o-o
is feeling like
o-o
a boa constrictor
o-o
wrapping around
o-o
my lungs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Take a deep breath.
o-o
This will be
o-o
easier.
o-o
So far we've
o-o
been talking
o-o
about how to
o-o
choose a
o-o
mayor,
o-o
governor,
o-o
or president
o-o
with fairness.
o-o
That's the first half.
o-o
But what happens
o-o
when there are
o-o
lots of seats
o-o
to fill,
o-o
like in
o-o
Congress?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain overload!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh right.
o-o
Instead, try this.
o-o
Imagine a
o-o
group of friends
o-o
choosing a
o-o
second
o-o
pizza
o-o
topping
o-o
for a pizza
o-o
they will share.
o-o
How would the
o-o
second topping
o-o
be chosen?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't the
o-o
second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate,
o-o
er, topping,
o-o
be elected,
o-o
er,
o-o
selected?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular has
o-o
more than one
o-o
meaning.
o-o
So let's try
o-o
yet another
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
five wolves and
o-o
four sheep vote
o-o
on what to eat
o-o
for dinner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ha! The five wolves
o-o
would eat the
o-o
four sheep!
o-o
And claim it's fair
o-o
because it's
o-o
democracy!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So us
o-o
minorities,
o-o
like the sheep,
o-o
need a way to
o-o
fight against a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Bill of Rights
o-o
is nice,
o-o
but that's
o-o
not enough
o-o
to protect us
o-o
minorities
o-o
from whites.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
As you see,
o-o
just getting a
o-o
majority
o-o
is not a
o-o
fully
o-o
zoomed out
o-o
view.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see somethin'
o-o
else too.
o-o
If districts
o-o
were filled with
o-o
wolves 'n sheep,
o-o
'n each district
o-o
had slightly more
o-o
wolves than sheep,
o-o
then every
o-o
district would
o-o
elect a wolf.
o-o
Then congress would
o-o
be nothin' but wolves.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's not far from
o-o
what are now
o-o
mostly
o-o
white males.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In Europe,
o-o
instead of just
o-o
wolves and sheep,
o-o
they have a
o-o
handful of
o-o
political parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like wolves and sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sure.
o-o
On the ballot
o-o
each voter marks their
o-o
favorite
o-o
political party.
o-o
Let's say
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
mark their
o-o
ballot for
o-o
the Pirate
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'd join that one.
o-o
It sounds like
o-o
they're against
o-o
puppets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do they slash
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
with their
o-o
swords?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They don't carry
o-o
swords,
o-o
or dress like
o-o
pirates.
o-o
But they do
o-o
oppose
o-o
what they think is
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Go pirates!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In some
o-o
European
o-o
countries,
o-o
adjustments
o-o
are done to
o-o
ensure the
o-o
Pirate party,
o-o
and every
o-o
other party,
o-o
gets their fair share
o-o
of seats in
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It hides the
o-o
unfairness of
o-o
still using
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballots.
o-o
Yet there are
o-o
lots of people
o-o
who like it.
o-o
That's because
o-o
they can point to
o-o
someone in
o-o
parliament
o-o
and claim their vote
o-o
helped elect
o-o
that MP,
o-o
er,
o-o
member of
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
From reading
o-o
news about
o-o
Europe those
o-o
governments
o-o
have as much
o-o
corruption
o-o
as us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Back to
o-o
voting here
o-o
in the United States,
o-o
suppose each district
o-o
filled two seats
o-o
in the house of
o-o
representatives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means districts
o-o
would be twice the
o-o
size of existing
o-o
districts, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Very good!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, half as many
o-o
districts,
o-o
and two seats
o-o
per district.
o-o
Sounds slick.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course the
o-o
most popular
o-o
candidate wins
o-o
the first seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So how's the
o-o
second seat filled?
o-o
In a way that's fair.
o-o
For the sheep,
o-o
and goats,
o-o
and pigs?
o-o
Or maybe I should say,
o-o
for women to get
o-o
the representation
o-o
we deserve.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Using simple math,
o-o
a computer can
o-o
calculate which
o-o
voters are 
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
by the first hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since that math
o-o
is simple,
o-o
I don't need to
o-o
hear about it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sweet!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The ballots
o-o
of those
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
voters
o-o
would have their
o-o
influence
o-o
greatly reduced.
o-o
Often all the
o-o
way to zero.
o-o
The remaining
o-o
voters still have
o-o
full influence
o-o
for their ballots.
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
is done again,
o-o
and the most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
wins the
o-o
second seat.
o-o
In this
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm guessing the
o-o
effect would be
o-o
to elect one
o-o
Republican
o-o
and one
o-o
Democrat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Typically yes,
o-o
assuming both
o-o
parties offer
o-o
good candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That means
o-o
there would be
o-o
more than just
o-o
one
o-o
Republican
o-o
'n one
o-o
Democrat
o-o
in the race?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes because
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
o-o
So we need
o-o
to allow
o-o
for the
o-o
possibility
o-o
that one
o-o
of the
o-o
parties
o-o
only offers
o-o
disliked
o-o
candidates,
o-o
while the other
o-o
party offers
o-o
better
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, if, say,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party only
o-o
offered puppet
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Pinoke
o-o
'n Oscar,
o-o
'n the Democratic
o-o
party offered
o-o
anti hyphen-here corruption
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Barack
o-o
'n Hypatia,
o-o
then both winners
o-o
could be Democrats?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This seems like a
o-o
winning
o-o
pole vault
o-o
over our low
o-o
limbo bar,
o-o
where we
o-o
are now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But if every district
o-o
elects one
o-o
Republican and
o-o
one Democrat,
o-o
then Congress
o-o
would be tied.
o-o
That's cockeyed.
o-o
The population
o-o
is not
o-o
evenly
o-o
divided
o-o
between the
o-o
two parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To fix that
o-o
unfair balance,
o-o
we make the
o-o
districts a little
o-o
bigger. And we
o-o
reserve a few
o-o
extra seats.
o-o
Statewide seats.
o-o
Then we can do
o-o
the party hyphen-here based
o-o
adjustment to
o-o
figure out which
o-o
party deserves to win
o-o
each of those
o-o
statewide seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the party
o-o
leaders,
o-o
like the
o-o
insiders
o-o
in the Pirate
o-o
Party,
o-o
would get to
o-o
decide who should
o-o
fill those seats?
o-o
That seems
o-o
not right.
o-o
That would be
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Lots of
o-o
European
o-o
nations
o-o
do it that way.
o-o
Yet you're right.
o-o
It's not fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why are those
o-o
voters so
o-o
stupid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people
o-o
in power
o-o
are the ones who
o-o
have to approve
o-o
any change.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
o-o
The members of
o-o
parliament
o-o
only embrace
o-o
a change if it's
o-o
likely to get
o-o
themselves
o-o
re hyphen-here elected.
o-o
Otherwise it
o-o
would be as
o-o
unlikely as
o-o
turkeys voting
o-o
in favor of
o-o
Thanksgiving.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another barrier!
o-o
Political
o-o
turkeys.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Far fairer is
o-o
to look at the
o-o
ballots again
o-o
to identify
o-o
the most popular
o-o
of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
would fill that
o-o
party's
o-o
extra seat.
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each next seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That sounds like
o-o
it would rip
o-o
control away from
o-o
party insiders.
o-o
And empower
o-o
the voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much much
o-o
fairer than what
o-o
we've got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With no
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
elections
o-o
would no
o-o
longer be
o-o
limited
o-o
to just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
per party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
no more blocking,
o-o
like how
o-o
Hillary
o-o
Clinton
o-o
got blocked
o-o
in two thousand eight.
o-o
Right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha
o-o
you're bright.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's just counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And that's what the
o-o
important parts of
o-o
mathematics
o-o
are mostly about,
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how can the
o-o
ballot handle
o-o
lots of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from lots
o-o
of parties?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A separate
o-o
ballot question
o-o
can ask voters
o-o
to rank the
o-o
political parties.
o-o
That gives us the
o-o
info we need
o-o
to calculate
o-o
the popularity
o-o
of the
o-o
parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting for parties?
o-o
Is that really
o-o
a thing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's what lots of
o-o
people in lots
o-o
of nations do
o-o
on their ballots.
o-o
Using that info,
o-o
the most popular
o-o
parties can be
o-o
allowed to have
o-o
two or three of
o-o
their candidates
o-o
in each race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the least popular
o-o
parties get excluded?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That makes sense to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the biggest
o-o
third parties
o-o
get one candidate
o-o
each, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That gives small
o-o
parties an
o-o
opportunity
o-o
to grow.
o-o
And even to
o-o
overtake
o-o
big parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't like names,
o-o
but this is
o-o
getting
o-o
complex.
o-o
Is there a name
o-o
for all of
o-o
this mess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It is sort of like
o-o
a jigsaw puzzle
o-o
with lots of pieces,
o-o
and different
o-o
pieces would work,
o-o
and they have lots
o-o
of names.
o-o
The method
o-o
that reaches farthest
o-o
toward what
o-o
I've described
o-o
is called
o-o
VoteFair Ranking.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
VoteFair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
FairVote?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
VoteFair
o-o
is a ranking
o-o
method I like.
o-o
FairVote is an
o-o
organization
o-o
that promotes
o-o
what they call
o-o
begin-italics ranked choice end-italics
o-o
voting,
o-o
but that name
o-o
actually
o-o
covers two methods,
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting and
o-o
something called
o-o
the single
o-o
transferable
o-o
vote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's confusing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's overwhelming
o-o
to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
It's another
o-o
reason we
o-o
don't teach
o-o
this stuff,
o-o
even in
o-o
college courses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
OK, you like
o-o
VoteFair something.
o-o
Is there a
o-o
less hyphen-here specific
o-o
name?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
That's the most
o-o
important part.
o-o
Because pairwise counts
o-o
reveal not just support
o-o
but opposition.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
that you
o-o
recommend?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Plus adjustments
o-o
we've discussed that
o-o
give fuller
o-o
representation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
To the sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs
o-o
defending
o-o
themselves against
o-o
the wolves.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how hard's it
o-o
to do pairwise
o-o
counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
All the counting
o-o
is done by computer,
o-o
so a tap on the screen
o-o
is all you need
o-o
in a real
o-o
election.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the
o-o
barrier against
o-o
using ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Up until a few
o-o
decades ago, when
o-o
computers came along,
o-o
doing the math by hand
o-o
was the big barrier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But now we have
o-o
computers, so
o-o
what's stopping us
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fear.
o-o
Especially
o-o
a fear of math.
o-o
Officially
o-o
that's called
o-o
mathematical
o-o
anxiety.
o-o
Lots of people
o-o
have it 'cause
o-o
most people
o-o
don't trust what
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Math
o-o
anxiety.
o-o
That's what I
o-o
was infected
o-o
by.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
don't want
o-o
anyone
o-o
to cut the
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
they use to
o-o
control
o-o
politicians.
o-o
And their minions,
o-o
the insiders
o-o
within the two
o-o
political
o-o
parties,
o-o
don't want to
o-o
get fired.
o-o
Or lose their
o-o
perks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why isn't the
o-o
benefit
o-o
of greater
o-o
fairness
o-o
attracting
o-o
voters like a
o-o
magnet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You are so
o-o
na&#239;ve.
o-o
Greedy folks
o-o
are in control
o-o
and they don't want
o-o
fairness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those of us
o-o
who are
o-o
workin' hard
o-o
yet sufferin'
o-o
want our fair share
o-o
of the
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And rich people
o-o
want to protect
o-o
their too hyphen-here big slice
o-o
of economic pie,
o-o
probably with
o-o
vanilla
o-o
ice cream and
o-o
three cherries
o-o
on top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Speaking of that,
o-o
here are colored blocks
o-o
that represent
o-o
nine ballots,
o-o
and the colors
o-o
represent
o-o
ice cream flavors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Pretty colors!
o-o
Which flavors?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Dark brown is
o-o
chocolate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yum!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pink is for
o-o
strawberry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not a fan
o-o
of pink.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This color represents
o-o
mint chocolate
o-o
chip.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I presume
o-o
the last color
o-o
is vanilla.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But you haven't
o-o
explained why
o-o
you're pointing
o-o
out these
o-o
colored blocks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With these
o-o
ballot preferences
o-o
the winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla,
o-o
depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so the counting
o-o
method does
o-o
matter!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
o-o
And yet,
o-o
almost any
o-o
method is better
o-o
than what we've
o-o
got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So now
o-o
do we know
o-o
all about voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's one
o-o
more bit.
o-o
But you can learn
o-o
about it
o-o
later,
o-o
when you're ready.
o-o
It will be
o-o
improvements
o-o
in how members
o-o
of Congress
o-o
vote to decide
o-o
which bills
o-o
should pass
o-o
to become
o-o
laws.
o-o
But getting
o-o
that math right
o-o
is too advanced
o-o
for you now.

If elections were fair,
o-o
what would change,
o-o
politically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
especially
o-o
for the
o-o
unfortunate
o-o
poor.
o-o
And us college
o-o
grads who failed
o-o
to get to
o-o
the middle
o-o
class.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The answer to that
o-o
I don't know.
o-o
For that you need
o-o
to ask someone
o-o
who understands both
o-o
economics and
o-o
game theory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Game theory?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
o-o
Voting's a game!
o-o
That makes sense.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's an academic field
o-o
that studies, well,
o-o
it's difficult to
o-o
describe.
o-o
But it includes
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
I do know someone
o-o
with those credentials.
o-o
But he's at a
o-o
university
o-o
that's a three hyphen-here hour
o-o
drive away.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do you think he'd
o-o
give us a peek
o-o
into that
o-o
future?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I can ask him
o-o
by email.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be super!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He studies,
o-o
and teaches about,
o-o
economic history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The history
o-o
of economics?
o-o
That sounds like
o-o
a waste.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The history
o-o
of economics
o-o
would be boring
o-o
for the two of you.
o-o
But that's
o-o
different from 
o-o
economic
o-o
history,
o-o
which is what
o-o
he teaches.
o-o
That's the study
o-o
of economies
o-o
during earlier
o-o
times.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I hate
o-o
history.
o-o
As much as
o-o
I did
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This professor
o-o
can make
o-o
history fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can that be done?
o-o
'N economics,
o-o
that's more math.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You did great
o-o
understanding
o-o
some history about
o-o
mathematics.
o-o
As for math in
o-o
economics,
o-o
it's just different
o-o
names for money.
o-o
Like tax, debt,
o-o
interest,
o-o
subsidies,
o-o
and tariffs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And bribes,
o-o
and kickbacks,
o-o
and [?].
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm a dummy
o-o
but I'll
o-o
try.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
One more tip.
o-o
There's something
o-o
called begin-italics mathiness end-italics no-space .
o-o
It's a misuse of
o-o
mathematics.
o-o
Math doesn't lie,
o-o
but some liars
o-o
use numbers
o-o
when they lie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Mathiness
o-o
must be what
o-o
my landlord's
o-o
usin'
o-o
on me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I admit I tend
o-o
to distrust math
o-o
until I do the
o-o
counting or
o-o
calculations
o-o
myself.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So, we've
o-o
learned that
o-o
ranked choice ballots
o-o
and
o-o
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
is the key
o-o
to less corruption
o-o
in Washington
o-o
DC.
o-o
But do we need
o-o
to remember
o-o
that guy's name?
o-o
Condolences,
o-o
or something?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
includes
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
methods,
o-o
and some
o-o
non hyphen-here Condorcet
o-o
methods.
o-o
So just remember
o-o
the concept of
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
And needing more
o-o
than half those votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Half's a fraction
o-o
I can recall.
o-o
But I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
why you made a
o-o
big deal out of
o-o
the digit
o-o
zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It took our
o-o
ancestors
o-o
hundreds of years
o-o
to make the leap
o-o
from the number
o-o
zero
o-o
to the digit
o-o
zero.
o-o
To us,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
that's slow.
o-o
In a similar way
o-o
folks in the
o-o
distant future
o-o
will marvel that
o-o
it took so long
o-o
for us to use
o-o
pairwise counting
o-o
for counting votes.
o-o
Zero as a digit
o-o
changed the world
o-o
in marvellous ways.
o-o
Similarly
o-o
pairwise vote counting
o-o
will change the world
o-o
in marvellous ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So just like we
o-o
don't know what
o-o
we've got til
o-o
it's gone,
o-o
we don't really
o-o
know what's missing
o-o
until it can be
o-o
seen in
o-o
hindsight?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I was right.
o-o
You
begin-italics are end-italics
very bright.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a wise
o-o
insight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's just
o-o
common sense.
o-o
But what you've
o-o
taught us
o-o
are hidden
o-o
secrets.
o-o
The ones those
o-o
greedy
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Money
o-o
worshippers
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
...
o-o
business owners
o-o
...
o-o
don't want us
o-o
to find out.
o-o
We're grateful
o-o
you've guided
o-o
us through a
o-o
dark long cave
o-o
to a rich
o-o
treasure chest.
o-o
We'll share
o-o
what we've
o-o
learned.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember your
o-o
promise,
o-o
...
o-o
that you won't
o-o
reveal where
o-o
they came from.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, but why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I've got tenure,
o-o
so I'm not likely
o-o
to lose my job.
o-o
But I can
o-o
lose grants for
o-o
my research projects.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, 'n some of your
o-o
funds come from the
o-o
government, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes. Lots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When we bite the hand
o-o
that feeds you
o-o
we won't reveal
o-o
who took us off
o-o
our leashes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We can say we
o-o
learned it from
o-o
Wikipedia.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only bits of it
o-o
are in Wikipedia.
o-o
That's because
o-o
they require
o-o
academic
o-o
references,
o-o
especially
o-o
for
o-o
mathematical
o-o
topics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I suppose
o-o
those references
o-o
don't exist because
o-o
governments
o-o
don't fund such
o-o
research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is all seeming
o-o
like a giant
o-o
conspiracy,
o-o
except that it's
o-o
in plain view.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's hidden
o-o
behind the
o-o
curtain of
o-o
mathematics,
o-o
under the
o-o
unmarked
o-o
trap door
o-o
of pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Fear of math
o-o
keeps it well hidden.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This makes it
o-o
all the more special
o-o
that you've taken
o-o
the time to explain
o-o
this to us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm extremely
o-o
grateful.
o-o
You've given me,
o-o
us, more than I
o-o
could ever have
o-o
hoped for.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I love these kinds
o-o
of conversations.
o-o
I wish textbooks
o-o
and those dang
o-o
standardized
o-o
tests would allow
o-o
me to teach more
o-o
like this,
o-o
without as much
o-o
notation
o-o
and terminology.
o-o
The joy of math
o-o
is in the concepts.
o-o
That's what counts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I'm
o-o
beginning to see
o-o
a begin-italics fraction end-italics of
o-o
that joy in
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, one more thing.
o-o
Since pairwise counting
o-o
is a few years off,
o-o
what can we do
o-o
in the next
o-o
election
o-o
to fight against
o-o
vote splitting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Tell your friends,
o-o
including the
o-o
ones online,
o-o
that the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot,
o-o
what we use now,
o-o
is not asking
o-o
begin-italics who is your favorite? end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what's it
o-o
asking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Besides
o-o
which loser
o-o
do you want
o-o
to get stuck
o-o
with?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There is no
o-o
easy way
o-o
to say
o-o
what it's
o-o
asking.
o-o
And there's no way
o-o
to mark a
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot to say
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
o-o
And choosing
o-o
not to vote
o-o
does not express
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
o-o
Instead a
o-o
voter needs to
o-o
hold their nose
o-o
and mark a
o-o
candidate
o-o
who has a chance
o-o
of winning.
o-o
Otherwise
o-o
they weaken
o-o
the candidate
o-o
they prefer
o-o
who does have
o-o
a chance of
o-o
winning.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But that means
o-o
never voting
o-o
for a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
No.
o-o
You can vote for
o-o
a third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate
o-o
if the
o-o
candidate
o-o
you most despise
o-o
will easily
o-o
win.
o-o
That means
o-o
none of the
o-o
opposition
o-o
candidates
o-o
has a chance
o-o
of winning,
o-o
so then it
o-o
makes sense
o-o
to mark your
o-o
favorite
o-o
opposition
o-o
candidate,
o-o
which can be
o-o
from a third
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if Trump
o-o
would easily
o-o
get re hyphen-here elected
o-o
in the next
o-o
election,
o-o
I could vote
o-o
for a Green
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's an
o-o
important
o-o
exception
o-o
because in a
o-o
presidential
o-o
election
o-o
the popular
o-o
vote still
o-o
matters.
o-o
Specifically
o-o
the gap between
o-o
the
o-o
Republican
o-o
and the
o-o
Democrat
o-o
is put under
o-o
a microscope
o-o
to compare
o-o
those counts
o-o
with the
o-o
electoral
o-o
vote count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought
o-o
presidential
o-o
elections
o-o
were the most
o-o
important
o-o
to get right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The way to
o-o
help defeat
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is to vote in
o-o
begin-italics both end-italics
primary
o-o
begin-italics and end-italics
general
o-o
elections.
o-o
And especially
o-o
primary
o-o
elections
o-o
for members
o-o
of Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the best way
o-o
to express
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Promote the
o-o
adoption of
o-o
ranked choice ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So we should
o-o
protest!
o-o
With signs that say
o-o
...
o-o
uh,
o-o
what should they say?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a foreign
o-o
world to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe,
o-o
...
o-o
begin-italics
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
cuts puppet strings end-italics no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Well,
o-o
we can work out
o-o
that later.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And we can hope
o-o
that Jon

Oliver
o-o
tells us
o-o
we're stupid

pairwise
