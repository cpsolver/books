ambee sings-damien amenn
That's what I've
o-o
figured out.
sentence-next
o-o
But now I'm stuck.
sentence-next
o-o
I dunno how
o-o
to change elections
o-o
so they don't suck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We can call attention
o-o
to this deception.
sentence-next
o-o
We'll get voters
o-o
to concentrate
o-o
their votes on
o-o
either Barack
o-o
or Hypatia.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Who'd decide
o-o
which candidate
o-o
to boycott?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We the voters
o-o
could get one to
o-o
vacate their spot,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd coax
o-o
the wealthiest
o-o
campaign donors
o-o
to quietly fund
o-o
yet another
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
One who also
o-o
promises to
o-o
reduce corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Let's name this one
o-o
Gandhi.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes this
o-o
whack hyphen-here a hyphen-here mole
o-o
tactic's
o-o
difficult to beat.
sentence-next
o-o
It splits the voters
o-o
even more,
o-o
making it
o-o
even harder
o-o
to defeat
o-o
their single puppet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
All that happens
o-o
in each
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
Then in the
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
election
o-o
we have to choose
o-o
between the two
o-o
puppets,
o-o
one from each
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now it makes
o-o
yet more sense
o-o
why we have
o-o
just two main
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
This is quite
o-o
unlike
o-o
what I read in
o-o
poly sci begin-explain pronounced SIGH end-explain
o-o
textbooks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N years ago
o-o
puppet
o-o
politicians
o-o
passed a law
o-o
that gives
o-o
taxpayer funds
o-o
to a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
presidential
o-o
candidate
o-o
who gets more than
o-o
five percent of
o-o
the vote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought that
o-o
was a good thing.
sentence-next
o-o
But so far
o-o
it's been a bribe
o-o
to parties on the
o-o
liberal side.
sentence-next
o-o
While conservative
o-o
parties
o-o
don't take that bait.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The conservative
o-o
candidates
o-o
get their bribes
o-o
earlier,
o-o
before
o-o
election
o-o
season starts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So liberals
o-o
get seduced
o-o
into splitting
o-o
their votes.
sentence-next
o-o
While conservatives
o-o
quietly concentrate
o-o
their votes on just
o-o
one candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You learn fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I have a degree
o-o
in political
o-o
science.
sentence-next
o-o
But they never
o-o
taught us the
o-o
hidden money
o-o
part of this
o-o
tactical
o-o
unfairness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The unfairness
o-o
is well hyphen-here hidden
o-o
behind
o-o
numbers.
sentence-next
o-o
'N math to me
o-o
is scary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What scares me is
o-o
that our planet
o-o
is losing
o-o
snow leopards and
o-o
elephants, and
o-o
rhinoceros ...
sentence-next
o-o
es, and
o-o
dolphins, and
o-o
coral reefs, and
o-o
plant species
o-o
that could cure
o-o
and feed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that what
o-o
pushed you into
o-o
politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
At the age of
o-o
fourteen,
o-o
...
o-o
my mother died.
sentence-next
o-o
And then
o-o
my father lied.
sentence-next
o-o
He told me
o-o
that after
o-o
awhile I'd
o-o
get back my
o-o
smile.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can't imagine
o-o
what it'd be
o-o
like to lose
o-o
someone so close.
sentence-next
o-o
While still young.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Neither can I.
sentence-next
o-o
It's still
o-o
surrealistic.
sentence-next
o-o
Then just six
o-o
years later
o-o
another
o-o
tragic death
o-o
assaulted me.
sentence-next
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
My brother
o-o
was killed
o-o
by a bomb
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How did ya cope?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I almost lost hope.
sentence-next
o-o
Then I realized
o-o
my mother
o-o
was killed by
o-o
incompetent city
o-o
officials.
sentence-next
o-o
They failed to time
o-o
pedestrian walk
o-o
signals to give
o-o
walkers a head start.
sentence-next
o-o
Before the green
o-o
light for cars.
sentence-next
o-o
And I realized,
o-o
that basically,
o-o
my brother was
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East defending
o-o
profits for oil
o-o
companies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that why we're
o-o
in this graveyard?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
My mother and brother
o-o
are buried over there.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Buried
o-o
as a pair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With room to spare
o-o
for father
o-o
and me.
sentence-next
o-o
Over time I traced
o-o
the local
o-o
corruption
o-o
to the state level,
o-o
then to DC,
o-o
then to Congress
o-o
where they write
o-o
laws so corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
I can't define it.
sentence-next
o-o
But I sure see
o-o
tons of that
o-o
...
o-o
shit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's betrayal,
o-o
bribery,
o-o
cheating, and
o-o
coercion,
o-o
cronyism,
o-o
deceitfulness,
o-o
deluding, and
o-o

o-o
and

sentence-next
o-o
Plus lying.
sentence-next
o-o
And littering.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Littering?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's a gateway
o-o
crime.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If you think
o-o
I'm following,
o-o
then one of us
o-o
is lost.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like not picking
o-o
up dog poop,
o-o
'n not wearing
o-o
a face mask
o-o
in public
o-o
when you've got
o-o
a cough.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You're dancing
o-o
to the beat of
o-o
different
o-o
bongos now,
o-o
name-desha no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A dog owner
o-o
doesn't pick up
o-o
her dog's poop
o-o
because begin-italics her end-italics dog
o-o
will poke its own poop
o-o
with his snout.
sentence-next
o-o
She picks it up
o-o
so other dogs
o-o
don't poke the poop
o-o
with begin-italics their end-italics snouts.
sentence-next
o-o
In return,
o-o
those other dog
o-o
owners protect
o-o
her dog by
o-o
picking up their
o-o
dog's poop.
sentence-next
o-o
It's a
o-o
pooch
o-o
poop
o-o
scooper
o-o
loop.
sentence-next
o-o
And the same
o-o
kind of loop
o-o
works with
o-o
face masks
o-o
during an
o-o
epidemic,
o-o
but with coughs
o-o
and sneezes
o-o
and spittle
o-o
instead of
o-o
poop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What the
o-o
...
o-o
poo?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Corruption
o-o
of that loop
o-o
happens when
o-o
someone fails
o-o
to bend over
o-o
and scoop
o-o
their dog's poop.
sentence-next
o-o
It's an example
o-o
of corruption
o-o
in general.
sentence-next
o-o
It's when someone
o-o
gets something
o-o
by ignoring
o-o
the suffering
o-o
of others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So over hyphen-here reaching?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Greedily
o-o
over hyphen-here reaching
o-o
for what they want
o-o
while ignoring
o-o
the suffering
o-o
they inflict
o-o
on others.
sentence-next
o-o
I fight to
o-o
remind them
o-o
that's not OK.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Against people
o-o
who don't,
o-o
er,
o-o
participate
o-o
in
o-o
...
o-o
super pupper
o-o
...
o-o
pooper
o-o
scooper
o-o
loops?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Fighting against
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
I've got
o-o
a tattoo to
o-o
remind me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can I see it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's for
o-o
private tours
o-o
only.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it say?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's a graphic.
sentence-next

It reminds me
