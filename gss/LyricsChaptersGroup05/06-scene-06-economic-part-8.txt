Yes, but much more

sentence-next
o-o
Especially

If synthetic hydro ...

what's blocking that

There's no

The people who

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,

more bad feedback

This time it's

Is there something

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When Kodak tried to

But two young

hired them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What was the secret
o-o
that gave them an

advantage?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They were singers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The secret was singing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
At that time
o-o
color darkrooms
o-o
were completely dark,
o-o
so there was no way
o-o
to see a timer.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet the chemistry
o-o
was very time hyphen-here critical.
sentence-next
o-o
So they sang songs together

and used the timing of songs

as their timer
o-o
for chemical reactions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're saying
o-o
we need to
o-o
take up singing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It illustrates
o-o
that breakthroughs
o-o
often require
o-o
sub hyphen-here breakthroughs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So this means we

some kind of

Yes.

Until then

ambee sings-damien amenn
Any more tips?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
One way to fight

against bad

is to create

opposing

sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
ones that increase

economic

prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an

example

again.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Democracy

good

feedback loop.
sentence-next
o-o
It yields

o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
compared to
o-o
monarchy and
o-o
dictatorship.
sentence-next
o-o
That makes
o-o
oppressed people
o-o
jealous.
sentence-next
o-o
That jealousy
o-o
brought down the

Berlin wall,

toppled the

and ended

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
Jealousy

isn't always

a bad thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm learning that
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
are sometimes bad
o-o
and sometimes good.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good and bad
o-o
are just shortcut

ways to say
o-o
something
o-o
has lots of
o-o
advantages
o-o
or lots of
o-o
disadvantages.
sentence-next
o-o
But it depends
o-o
on who you are
o-o
as to whether
o-o
a change is an

advantage
o-o
or disadvantage.
sentence-next
o-o
It can even be
o-o
both good and bad
o-o
for the same
o-o
person,
o-o
like when
o-o
Henry Ford
o-o
paid his workers
o-o
higher than
o-o
usual salaries.
sentence-next
o-o
That increased
o-o
his labor costs,
o-o
but those
o-o
employees
o-o
could then afford
o-o
to buy Ford cars,
o-o
which brought in

more profits.

cherry pie

Shareholders

I can better

figure out how

to earn money

To do that

So here's a test.
