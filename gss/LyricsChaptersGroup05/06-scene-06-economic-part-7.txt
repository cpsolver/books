o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
is when a cause

it's as if

end-lyric

So he's saying

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A small number
o-o
for the wage hyphen-here gap

means managers

more of the profits

And you've explained

end-lyric

sentence-next
o-o
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I think I see.
sentence-next
o-o
It's vote

that causes
o-o
political

to only offer

one nominee
o-o
in each party.
sentence-next
o-o
And having
o-o
just one

per party
o-o
allows
o-o
the blocking tactic,

o-o
Hillary

Clinton
o-o
from reaching
o-o
the 2008
o-o
presidential
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
And vote
o-o
splitting
o-o
in primary
o-o
elections
o-o
allows money
o-o
to control
o-o
who wins
o-o
the party's

o-o
And it blocks
o-o
third parties

meaningful support.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
that's what

allows

corrupt

our choice to

one Republican

o-o
in our
