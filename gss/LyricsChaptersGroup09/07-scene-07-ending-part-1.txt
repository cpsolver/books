begin-comment Illustration:
Hospital recovery room, with single hospital bed, and one chair to right and behind bed.
Venture capitalist is lying in hospital bed, hooked up to monitor showing heartbeat.
Religious minister is sitting on chair, and is holding (closed) Bible.
Father of fiance is standing on right side.
In foreground are, from left to right, Desha, Damien, fiance.
Religious minister is Desha's (biological) father, so much match Desha's general racial/genetic characteristics, and he is wearing a priest's collar and Christian priest's black clothes.
Father of fiance much match fiance's general racial/genetic characteristics, and he is a nicely dressed businessman with coat and tie.
Everyone is facing Damien, and Damien is mostly facing viewer, but his head and partially his body is facing toward right side (toward fiance), as would happen in a performance on a theatre stage.

Father,
o-o
I've given lots of money
o-o
to your worthy church.
sentence-next
o-o
I've asked you here
o-o
because now I search
o-o
for a way to buy
o-o
the delay of death.
sentence-next
o-o
Please give me a reprieve
o-o
on my last breath.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister-firstuse amenn
Remember the

spiritual world
o-o
rests on top of
o-o
the physical world
o-o
that your body

is a part of.
sentence-next
o-o
It's like a

pyramid.

Too big

end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
At the top
o-o
the golden rule
o-o
of trying

to do good deeds
o-o
must rest on a

solid foundation
o-o
of not doing

ambee sings-minister amenn
Bingo!
o-o
I mean,
o-o
that's a great start.
sentence-next
Have you been
o-o
praying?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I've been trying.
sentence-next
o-o
But this
o-o
heart attack
o-o
has me scared.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To cast out fear,
o-o
fill your heart with love.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what your heart
o-o
needs lots more of.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I have no kids
o-o
and no real friends.
sentence-next
o-o
My money
o-o

o-o
but that's where
o-o
it ends.
sentence-next
o-o
Sadly,
o-o
I've not got a
o-o
loving wife
o-o
in my life.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course
o-o
women say
o-o
they want me,

but actually
o-o
what they crave are

Is there time to love?

o-o
Can it really heal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To love, first you must
o-o
let go of darkness.
sentence-next
o-o
Start with understanding
o-o
that money is not evil.
sentence-next
o-o
It's greed that is evil.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Is it greedy to want
o-o
to have it all?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
We are human,
o-o
so all of us
o-o
want it all.
sentence-next
o-o
But there's not enough
o-o
time or energy to
o-o
acquire it all.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
But there are
o-o
shortcuts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Most shortcuts
o-o
increase
o-o
suffering
o-o
for others.
sentence-next
o-o
That blocks you
o-o
from rising
o-o
spiritually,
o-o
and reaching
o-o
the highest
o-o
kinds of love,
o-o
far above
o-o
criminals
o-o
and lawyers,
o-o
...
o-o
I mean
o-o
sinners.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why the
o-o
Bible declares
o-o
a camel
o-o
can squeeze through
o-o
the eye of a
o-o
needle
o-o
easier than
o-o
a rich man
o-o
can become
o-o
a loving saint
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Thank God
o-o
it's the camel,
o-o
not me,
o-o
who has to fit
o-o
inside
o-o
that slit.
sentence-next
o-o
I do want
o-o
to be loved.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I'm not yet
o-o
tired of
o-o
being
o-o
admired.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Which has
o-o
a higher
o-o
priority?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's all
o-o
important.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
For something to be
o-o
important,
o-o
everything else
o-o
must be less
o-o
important.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I'm in a fog.
sentence-next
o-o
Don't I need to
o-o
engage in
o-o
combat
o-o
against the
o-o
wicked evil
o-o
hiding in
o-o
other
o-o
people?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
If you're thinking
o-o
of wickedness
o-o
in horror flicks,
o-o
super hyphen-here hero
o-o
comic books,
o-o
and murderous
o-o
Voldemort,
o-o
that's all
o-o
fiction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What about
o-o
the news?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
News sources
o-o
sell your
o-o
eyeballs and
o-o
ears to
o-o
advertisers,
o-o
so they choose
o-o
dramatic news
o-o
and sound bites
o-o
that excite
o-o
your fears,
o-o
your anger,
o-o
your desires,
o-o
and your
o-o
laughter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah yes,
o-o
assault weapons
o-o
in the hands
o-o
of blind
o-o
pacifists
o-o
would never
o-o
qualify
o-o
as newsworthy.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I still
o-o
vividly
o-o
remember
o-o
as a child
o-o
hearing priests
o-o
yelling in anger
o-o
against
o-o
the devil
o-o
to stop tempting
o-o
us mortal souls.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Drama and fear
o-o
attracts
o-o
bigger
o-o
congregations
o-o
and bigger
o-o
donations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What about the
o-o
Holocaust?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
During a time of
o-o
nationwide
o-o
starvation,
o-o
and massive
o-o
economic
o-o
suffering,
o-o
plus mass
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
the Nazi
o-o
government
o-o
encouraged
o-o
non hyphen-here Jewish
o-o
Germans
o-o
to steal gold
o-o
and cash and
o-o
houses and
o-o
businesses
o-o
and dignity
o-o
from Jews.
sentence-next
o-o
Ironically
o-o
Jews became
o-o
wealthy
o-o
because
o-o
early
o-o
Christians
o-o
recruited Jews
o-o
living in
o-o
ghettos
o-o
to lend money.
sentence-next
o-o
That was back when
o-o
early Christian
o-o
leaders
o-o
declared it was
o-o
a sin
o-o
for Christians
o-o
to charge
o-o
interest
o-o
on loans.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That explains
o-o
why Jews
o-o
aren't a small
o-o
minority
o-o
in the banking
o-o
industry
o-o
and in
o-o
New York City.
sentence-next
o-o
But surely
o-o
there's no excuse
o-o
for the evil
o-o
in dictators,
o-o
terrorists,
o-o
and mass
o-o
murderers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Dictators
o-o
are addicted
o-o
to ego boosts,
o-o
so they fight
o-o
to own
o-o
mistresses
o-o
and an
o-o
ego hyphen-here inflated
o-o
yacht.
sentence-next
o-o
Terrorists
o-o
and soldiers
o-o
mostly fight
o-o
to protect
o-o
their friends,
o-o
family,
o-o
culture,
o-o
money,
o-o
and sexuality.
sentence-next
o-o
Alas,
o-o
a few people
o-o
do cling
o-o
to the disease
o-o
of evil
o-o
long after
o-o
getting
o-o
infected.
sentence-next
o-o
That infection
o-o
comes from
o-o
an immature
o-o
human who
o-o
also still clings
o-o
to the disease.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately,
o-o
eventually,
o-o
in a real
o-o
democracy
o-o
that evil
o-o
dies out.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
all of us
o-o
begin our time
o-o
in the womb
o-o
feeling
o-o
unconditional
o-o
joy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What other kind
o-o
of democracy
o-o
is there,
o-o
besides a
o-o
real one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Citizens
o-o
in Russia
o-o
and some other
o-o
countries
o-o
can vote,
o-o
but the results
o-o
are rigged.
sentence-next
o-o
Those aren't
o-o
real
o-o
democracies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Is there an
o-o
antidote
o-o
to evil?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes,
o-o
talking.
sentence-next
o-o
To people on
o-o
the other side.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Talking.
sentence-next
o-o
I do lots
o-o
of that,
o-o
as part of
o-o
business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Do you ask
o-o
questions
o-o
with a desire
o-o
to understand
o-o
the other person's
o-o
point of view?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Why would I
o-o
do that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Consider what
o-o
ended apartheid
o-o
in South
o-o
Africa.
sentence-next
o-o
It was secret
o-o
talks.
sentence-next
o-o
One of them
o-o
was between
o-o
Nelson Mandela,
o-o
and a
o-o
clergyman,
o-o
and the
o-o
clergyman's
o-o
twin brother
o-o
who led a
o-o
militant
o-o
group that
o-o
supported
o-o
apartheid.
sentence-next
o-o
Through talking,
o-o
Mandela
o-o
and the
o-o
pro hyphen-here apartheid
o-o
leader
o-o
discovered
o-o
unexpected
o-o
common ground.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Does this work in
o-o
relationships?
sentence-next
o-o
I admit
o-o
I could use
o-o
some of those
o-o
kinds of tips.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
But don't expect
o-o
to fully
o-o
unveil
o-o
the other
o-o
person's
o-o
fantasies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I don't need
o-o
to reveal my
o-o
fantasies,
o-o
do I?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Not those kinds
o-o
of fantasies.
sentence-next
o-o
I mean something
o-o
like you believing
o-o
evil hides
o-o
in most other
o-o
people.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm using
o-o
the word
o-o
fantasy
o-o
instead of
o-o
words like
o-o
beliefs,
o-o
expectations,
o-o
assumptions,
o-o
and memories.
sentence-next
o-o
Because
o-o
everyone
o-o
thinks
o-o
they fully grasp
o-o
reality,
o-o
yet none of us
o-o
can do that,
o-o
especially
o-o
not what
o-o
the future
o-o
has waiting
o-o
for us.
sentence-next
o-o
Your goal
o-o
for talking
o-o
is to reveal
o-o
a single path
o-o
both of you
o-o
can walk along,
o-o
side by side,
o-o
in harmony.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah,
o-o
I know some
o-o
women who have
o-o
the fantasy
o-o
that every male
o-o
is a
o-o
sexual wolf
o-o
unless he's gay.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
It's like how you
o-o
believe evil
o-o
lurks in jerks.
sentence-next
o-o
Some folks,
o-o
instead of evil,
o-o
might ascribe
o-o
the same
o-o
behaviors
o-o
as stupidity.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet others fear
o-o
they are the ones
o-o
who are queer,
o-o
I mean odd.
sentence-next
o-o
Talking reveals
o-o
which fantasy
o-o
the other
o-o
person mistakes
o-o
for reality.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah yes,
o-o
word meanings
o-o
are sloppy.
sentence-next
o-o
Like when someone
o-o
says begin-italics next Friday end-italics
o-o
on a Wednesday.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
Ambiguity,
o-o
multiple
o-o
meanings,
o-o
make it easy
o-o
to assume
o-o
the words mean what
o-o
you expect,
o-o
instead of
o-o
what the speaker
o-o
intends.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why talking
o-o
should be
o-o
two hyphen-here sided,
o-o
with a desire
o-o
to understand
o-o
the other person's
o-o
fantasy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
My head is
o-o
spinning.
sentence-next
o-o
Without money
o-o
as a compass
o-o
I'm lost.
sentence-next
o-o
And winning.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the only
o-o
goal I know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Ah, yes,
o-o
winning.
sentence-next
o-o
Parents and
o-o
teachers
o-o
use gold stars
o-o
to entice
o-o
kids to learn
o-o
to write.
sentence-next
o-o
Employers use
o-o
employee hyphen-here of hyphen-here the hyphen-here month
o-o
perks to
o-o
motivate
o-o
employees
o-o
to obey their
o-o
alarm clocks.
sentence-next
o-o
The movie
o-o
industry
o-o
and Broadway
o-o
use award galas
o-o
to promote
o-o
high hyphen-here cost
o-o
forms of
o-o
entertainment.
sentence-next
o-o
But with
o-o
maturity
o-o
we leave behind
o-o
the gold stars,
o-o
the shiny
o-o
trophies,
o-o
and even the
o-o
dream of
o-o
attracting a
o-o
huge audience.
sentence-next
o-o
The real prizes
o-o
are learning
o-o
and doing.
sentence-next
o-o
And making
o-o
people smile.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
How do I win
o-o
the game of
o-o
spirituality?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Spirituality's
o-o
trophy
o-o
is joy.
sentence-next
o-o
Unlike money
o-o
and power,
o-o
joy is not
o-o
a limited
o-o
resource.
sentence-next
o-o
It's a skill,
o-o
not a
o-o
competition.
sentence-next
o-o
Ripping joy
o-o
from someone
o-o
doesn't give you
o-o
more of it.

ambee sings-vc amenn
How do I

ambee sings-minister amenn
Live in the present.

Let go of the future.

Hold on to wise plans

But let go of

inconsequential

for wearing
