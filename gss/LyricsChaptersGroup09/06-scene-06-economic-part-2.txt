Do you know what
o-o
the silk road was?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah.
sentence-next
o-o
Marco Polo
o-o
and lots of
o-o
caravans
o-o
traveled along
o-o
it to get silk
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Instead of
o-o
just selling
o-o
spools of silk,
o-o
the Chinese
o-o
in the
o-o
Forbidden city
o-o
wove it into
o-o
begin-italics beautiful end-italics
o-o
fabric
o-o
that was worth
o-o
more than
o-o
its weight
o-o
in gold.
sentence-next
o-o
To protect
o-o
their monopoly
o-o
they kept their
o-o
special
o-o
silkworms within
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which is where
o-o
the emperor
o-o
lived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
With his
o-o
harem,
o-o
I presume.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That monopoly
o-o
lasted for
o-o
centuries.
sentence-next
o-o
So they aren't
o-o
always blips
o-o
in time.
sentence-next
o-o
Also the
o-o
Arabic hyphen-here speaking
o-o
traders
o-o
along the
o-o
middle eastern
o-o
part of the
o-o
silk road
o-o
monopolized
o-o
access
o-o
to that silk,
o-o
and that trade
o-o
monopoly
o-o
also lasted
o-o
for centuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Portuguese
o-o
ships
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Brazil,
o-o
and then
o-o
Columbus
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Caribbean
o-o
Islands.
sentence-next
o-o
They were looking
o-o
for an
o-o
alternate route
o-o
to China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK,
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are not always
o-o
short blips.
sentence-next
o-o
And I see
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are good for
o-o
sellers
o-o
but bad for
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
But how does that
o-o
affect today's
o-o
economy?
sentence-next
o-o
It seems like
o-o
rising to
o-o
the middle class
o-o
based on hard work
o-o
is something
o-o
from the past,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not that
o-o
simple.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you know
o-o
about inflation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah!
sentence-next
o-o
The cost of
o-o
rent 'n food
o-o
'n ice cream
o-o
are going up
o-o
and up fast
o-o
while salaries
o-o
suck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
My paycheck
o-o
is almost a
o-o
vacuum cleaner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
reasons why
o-o
the cost of living
o-o
is going up
o-o
faster than
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
which is the
o-o
official
o-o
measurement
o-o
of inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I remember
o-o
that number
o-o
is flawed
o-o
a bit,
o-o
but I forgot
o-o
why it's full of
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Part of the why
o-o
is because
o-o
back when the price
o-o
of food items
o-o
were quickly
o-o
rising,
o-o
some food items
o-o
were replaced by
o-o
items whose cost
o-o
were declining.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's declining
o-o
in cost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The per hyphen-here pixel cost
o-o
of digital
o-o
cameras.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize
o-o
that word begin-italics per end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
It means division.
sentence-next
o-o
And the number
o-o
of pixels in
o-o
a camera
o-o
are going up,
o-o
so dividing by
o-o
that bigger number
o-o
makes the result
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The
o-o
government
o-o
is hiding the real
o-o
cost of living!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why
o-o
are they
o-o
lying?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The consumer
o-o
price index
o-o
is linked to
o-o
such things as
o-o
retirement
o-o
pensions for
o-o
government
o-o
employees,
o-o
and social
o-o
security
o-o
benefits,
o-o
and the
o-o
interest
o-o
the government
o-o
pays for
o-o
borrowed
o-o
money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the government
o-o
basically
o-o
uses tricks
o-o
to pretend
o-o
inflation
o-o
is low,
o-o
so it pays out
o-o
less money,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics tricks end-italics
o-o
is a bit
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We can't
o-o
call it
o-o
what it is,
o-o
which is
o-o
lying and
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
Shall we
o-o
call it
o-o
slick
o-o
arithmetic?
sentence-next
o-o
Or the
o-o
shopper
o-o
whopper
o-o
index?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's not.
sentence-next
o-o
Already I'm
o-o
avoiding talking about
o-o
economic
o-o
terminology
o-o
such as begin-italics the tragedy
o-o
of the commons end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Instead I'm
o-o
simplifying
o-o
by talking about
o-o
economic pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No wonder
o-o
school is so
o-o
distasteful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm glad we're
o-o
not getting
o-o
the common
o-o
tragic
o-o
version.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Getting back to
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
it excludes
o-o
rent and home
o-o
ownership
o-o
because they're
o-o
too difficult
o-o
to measure
o-o
in a way that's
o-o
fruitful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Home
o-o
ownership
o-o
is a fuzzy
o-o
mirage
o-o
to me.
sentence-next
o-o
As for food
o-o
and ice cream,
o-o
they're rising
o-o
like a rocket.
sentence-next
o-o
Inflation
o-o
is ripping off
o-o
a bigger
o-o
and bigger
o-o
part of my
o-o
paycheck.
sentence-next
o-o
Is anything else
o-o
being fudged?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Or faked,
o-o
falsified,
o-o
hoaxed,
o-o
or
o-o
quacked?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
do you
o-o
remember from
o-o
econ one oh one
o-o
what determines
o-o
interest rates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The federal
o-o
reserve chooses
o-o
when to increase
o-o
and decrease the
o-o
interest rate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the rate
o-o
talked about
o-o
in the news.
sentence-next
o-o
But more important
o-o
is the rate
o-o
determined by
o-o
auctioning
o-o
treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Auctions,
o-o
that means
o-o
sold to the
o-o
highest bidder,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes.
o-o
But I don't
o-o
remember
o-o
learning about
o-o
those
o-o
auctions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not taught to
o-o
undergrads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll bet textbooks
o-o
don't include it
o-o
because schools
o-o
are funded by
o-o
the government.
sentence-next
o-o
So textbooks can't
o-o
reveal secrets
o-o
the government
o-o
wants to hide.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In economically
o-o
optimistic
o-o
times
o-o
those auctioned
o-o
U.S.
o-o
treasuries
o-o
sell for
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
closer to the
o-o
amount the
o-o
government pays
o-o
when they reach their
o-o
redemption date.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but in
o-o
economically
o-o
pessimistic
o-o
times the buyers
o-o
pay much less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
then the gap
o-o
between
o-o
purchase price
o-o
and redemption
o-o
payment
o-o
increases.
sentence-next
o-o
So that
o-o
brings up rates
o-o
of interest.
