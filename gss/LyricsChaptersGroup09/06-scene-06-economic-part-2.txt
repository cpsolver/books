I don't know.

This has to do
o-o
with World War Two,
o-o
doesn't it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
That war happened
o-o
back in, ...
sentence-next
o-o
well it ended in
o-o
nineteen forty five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Well,
o-o
the
o-o
boomer babies
o-o
were born
o-o
and raised.
sentence-next
o-o
That
o-o
increased
o-o
consumption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Shift your focus
o-o
from consumption
o-o
to production.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Does this relate
o-o
to factories
o-o
not getting bombed?
sentence-next
o-o
Here in the U.S.?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Factories
o-o
and power plants
o-o
throughout
o-o
the world
o-o
were bombed,
o-o
except in
o-o
the United States,
o-o
Canada,
o-o
and less hyphen-here accessible
o-o
parts of
o-o
Russia.
sentence-next
o-o
Why was that
o-o
noteworthy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Anyone who wanted
o-o
a factory job
o-o
could get one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
What else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Didn't factory jobs
o-o
pay well back then?
sentence-next
o-o
Well enough
o-o
to buy a house?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
and what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't feel
o-o
brainy,
o-o
'cause I don't
o-o
see where
o-o
you're going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What's that called
o-o
when there is only
o-o
one place that sells
o-o
what people
o-o
want to buy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
a monopoly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Oh yeah,
o-o
the entire world
o-o
had to buy
o-o
manufactured
o-o
goods
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
and Canada
o-o
and Russia.
sentence-next
o-o
Because other
o-o
factories
o-o
on the planet
o-o
had become
o-o
dinosaurs,
o-o
wiped out by
o-o
bombs instead
o-o
of an
o-o
asteroid.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And when there's
o-o
a monopoly
o-o
the seller
o-o
can sell
o-o
at high prices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And that big
o-o
flow of money
o-o
to factories
o-o
meant higher
o-o
wages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great thinking!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wait a minute!
sentence-next
o-o
Is that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity 
o-o
what voters
o-o
think of
o-o
when they hear
o-o
the slogan
o-o
about making
o-o
America
o-o
great again?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this is why
o-o
the reverse hyphen-here raccoon hyphen-here eyed guy
o-o
with the never hyphen-here changing tie
o-o
got so many votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yet he blames
o-o
immigrants
o-o
and blacks
o-o
and women
o-o
for the bad
o-o
economy
o-o
we have now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm the son of
o-o
immigrant
o-o
parents,
o-o
from India.
sentence-next
o-o
So I know
o-o
that makes
o-o
as much sense
o-o
as standing up
o-o
in a hammock.
sentence-next
o-o
Even worse,
o-o
it's simplistic
o-o
to think
o-o
we can regain
o-o
that prior
o-o
prosperity
o-o
by building
o-o
factories.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you see why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The monopoly
o-o
ended.
sentence-next
o-o
Other nations
o-o
built new
o-o
factories.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does this mean
o-o
the belief
o-o
that anyone
o-o
can get rich by
o-o
working hard
o-o
has reached
o-o
its expiration
o-o
date?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
History
o-o
reveals
o-o
that prosperity
o-o
happens when a
o-o
city, nation,
o-o
or region
o-o
sells something
o-o
that people outside
o-o
the region
o-o
either need or
o-o
strongly desire.
sentence-next
o-o
And it's not
o-o
available from
o-o
anywhere else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are just
o-o
short blips
o-o
that expire
o-o
like fads,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Do you know what
o-o
the silk road was?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah.
sentence-next
o-o
Marco Polo
o-o
and lots of
o-o
caravans
o-o
traveled along
o-o
it to get silk
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Instead of
o-o
just selling
o-o
spools of silk,
o-o
the Chinese
o-o
in the
o-o
Forbidden city
o-o
wove it into
o-o
begin-italics beautiful end-italics
o-o
fabric
o-o
that was worth
o-o
more than
o-o
its weight
o-o
in gold.
sentence-next
o-o
To protect
o-o
their monopoly
o-o
they kept their
o-o
special
o-o
silkworms within
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which is where
o-o
the emperor
o-o
lived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I presume
o-o
with a harem
o-o
in addition
o-o
to the worms.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That monopoly
o-o
lasted for
o-o
centuries.
sentence-next
o-o
So they aren't
o-o
always blips
o-o
in time.
sentence-next
o-o
Also the
o-o
Arabic hyphen-here speaking
o-o
traders
o-o
along the
o-o
Middle East
o-o
portion of the
o-o
silk road
o-o
monopolized
o-o
access
o-o
to that silk,
o-o
and that trade
o-o
monopoly
o-o
also lasted
o-o
for centuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK,
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are not always
o-o
short blips.
sentence-next
o-o
And I see
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are good for
o-o
sellers
o-o
but bad for
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
But how does that
o-o
affect today's
o-o
economy?
sentence-next
o-o
It seems like
o-o
rising to
o-o
the middle class
o-o
based on hard work
o-o
is something
o-o
from the past,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not that
o-o
simple.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you know
o-o
about inflation?
end-lyric



ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah!
sentence-next
o-o
The cost of
o-o
rent 'n food
o-o
'n utilities
o-o
are going up
o-o
and up fast
o-o
while salaries
o-o
suck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
My paycheck
o-o
would beat
o-o
both of yours
o-o
in a
o-o
vacuum cleaner
o-o
competition.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
reasons why
o-o
the cost of living
o-o
is going up
o-o
faster than
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
which is the
o-o
official
o-o
measurement
o-o
of inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I remember
o-o
that number
o-o
is flawed
o-o
a bit,
o-o
but I forgot
o-o
why it's full of
o-o
...
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Part of the why
o-o
is because
o-o
back when the price
o-o
of food items
o-o
were quickly
o-o
rising,
o-o
some food items
o-o
were replaced by
o-o
items whose cost
o-o
were declining.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's declining
o-o
in cost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The per hyphen-here pixel cost
o-o
of digital
o-o
cameras.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize
o-o
that word begin-italics per end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
It means division.
sentence-next
o-o
The number
o-o
of pixels in
o-o
a camera
o-o
are going up.
sentence-next
o-o
So dividing by
o-o
that bigger number
o-o
makes the result
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The
o-o
government
o-o
is hiding the real
o-o
cost of living!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why
o-o
are they
o-o
lying?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The consumer
o-o
price index
o-o
is linked to
o-o
government costs.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as
o-o
social
o-o
security
o-o
benefits
o-o
and
o-o
retirement
o-o
pensions for
o-o
government
o-o
employees.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the government
o-o
basically
o-o
uses tricks
o-o
to pretend
o-o
inflation
o-o
is low,
o-o
so it pays out
o-o
less money,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics tricks end-italics
o-o
is a bit
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We can't
o-o
call it
o-o
what it is,
o-o
which is
o-o
lying and
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
Shall we
o-o
call it
o-o
slick
o-o
arithmetic?
sentence-next
o-o
Or the
o-o
shopper
o-o
whopper
o-o
index?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's not.
sentence-next
o-o
Already I'm
o-o
avoiding talking about
o-o
economics
o-o
terminology
o-o
such as begin-italics the tragedy
o-o
of the commons end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Instead I'm
o-o
simplifying
o-o
by talking about
o-o
economic pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No wonder
o-o
school is so
o-o
distasteful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Thank you for
o-o
not giving
o-o

o-o
the common
o-o
tragic
o-o
version.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Getting back to
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
it excludes
o-o
rent and home
o-o
ownership
o-o
because they're
o-o
too difficult
o-o
to measure
o-o
in a way that's
o-o
fruitful.

ambee sings-desha amenn
Affordable housing
o-o
has become

As for food
