name-desha no-space ,
o-o
do you
o-o
remember from
o-o
econ one oh one
o-o
what determines
o-o
interest rates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The federal
o-o
reserve chooses
o-o
when to increase
o-o
and decrease the
o-o
interest rate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the rate
o-o
talked about
o-o
in the news.
sentence-next
o-o
But more important
o-o
is the rate
o-o
determined by
o-o
auctioning
o-o
treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Auctions,
o-o
that means
o-o
sold to the
o-o
highest bidder,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes.
o-o
But I don't
o-o
remember
o-o
learning about
o-o
those
o-o
auctions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not taught to
o-o
undergrads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll bet textbooks
o-o
don't include it
o-o
because schools
o-o
are funded by
o-o
the government.
sentence-next
o-o
So textbooks can't
o-o
reveal secrets
o-o
the government
o-o
wants to hide.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In economically
o-o
optimistic
o-o
times
o-o
those auctioned
o-o
U.S.
o-o
treasuries
o-o
sell for
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
closer to the
o-o
amount the
o-o
government pays
o-o
when they reach their
o-o
redemption date.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but in
o-o
economically
o-o
pessimistic
o-o
times the buyers
o-o
pay much less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Then the gap
o-o
between
o-o
purchase price
o-o
and redemption
o-o
payment
o-o
increases.
sentence-next
o-o
So that
o-o
brings up rates
o-o
of interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Optimism?
sentence-next
o-o
Pessimism?
sentence-next
o-o
Feelings matter?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You buy more stuff,
o-o
at higher prices,
o-o
when you're
o-o
less afraid
o-o
of the future.
sentence-next
o-o
Like during
o-o
the cheery
o-o
holiday season.
sentence-next
o-o
Economists
o-o
measure
o-o
those feelings.
sentence-next
o-o
Even the
o-o
holiday ones.
sentence-next
o-o
It helps to
o-o
predict
o-o
the future.
sentence-next
o-o
You've heard of the
o-o
consumer
o-o
confidence
o-o
index,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm a consumer.
sentence-next
o-o
Or I try to be.
sentence-next
o-o
But I have no
o-o
confidence
o-o
in the future.
sentence-next
o-o
And at
o-o
the moment
o-o
something makes
o-o
no sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Interest rates
o-o
have been low
o-o
most of my
o-o
life.
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
there's been lots
o-o
of buyers
o-o
for those
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
things?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes, normally.
sentence-next
o-o
But years ago
o-o
China and
o-o
Russia stopped
o-o
buying them.
sentence-next
o-o
So lately the
o-o
federal
o-o
reserve
o-o
has been buying
o-o
lots of them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm even
o-o
more confused.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The government
o-o
buying its own
o-o
money?
sentence-next
o-o
That makes
o-o
no sense.
sentence-next
o-o
It would be like
o-o
a plush toy
o-o
dinosaur
o-o
business
o-o
buying its own
o-o
dinos begin-explain either pronunciation end-explain to give
o-o
the appearance
o-o
of extra customers
o-o
and income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's partly
o-o
why the deficit
o-o
is so huge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
so the U.S.
o-o
government has
o-o
increased its debt
o-o
to compensate
o-o
for rough times
o-o
economically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a moment.
sentence-next
o-o
Our economy's
o-o
like a stack of
o-o
wood blocks in a
o-o
teetering tower
o-o
that's ready to
o-o
fall?
sentence-next
o-o
Except that
o-o
kind of falling
o-o
will kill
o-o
and maim
o-o
instead of
o-o
just shame?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
All nations
o-o
and all big
o-o
businesses
o-o
are in debt.
sentence-next
o-o
So are farmers.
sentence-next
o-o
They all have to
o-o
borrow first
o-o
before they can
o-o
grow crops or
o-o
manufacture
o-o
or whatever to
o-o
get income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So being in debt
o-o
isn't a big deal.
sentence-next
o-o
But a growing
o-o
debt, that's
o-o
disastrous,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Relatively
o-o
speaking, yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But as long as
o-o
the government
o-o
is keeping its
o-o
citizens happy,
o-o
and happier than
o-o
in other nations,
o-o
problems can be
o-o
hidden behind
o-o
curtains of
o-o
distraction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The number of
o-o
people trying
o-o
to immigrate
o-o
into the U.S.
o-o
is still high.
sentence-next
o-o
So that
o-o
suggests
o-o
success.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet things
o-o
are a mess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what should be
o-o
going on instead?
sentence-next
o-o
Besides
o-o
traveling
o-o
in flying
o-o
cars.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
An important way
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity
o-o
is to increase
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How come
o-o
prosperity
o-o
increases
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your time machine
o-o
is running
o-o
backwards.
sentence-next
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
increases
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Consider the
o-o
Roman empire.
sentence-next
o-o
They wrote laws
o-o
to control
o-o
business and
o-o
commerce.
sentence-next
o-o
And they used
o-o
soldiers and
o-o
inspectors
o-o
and courts
o-o
to enforce
o-o
those laws.
sentence-next
o-o
An especially
o-o
important
o-o
innovation
o-o
was to set
o-o
standards for
o-o
weights and sizes.
sentence-next
o-o
And they built roads
o-o
and patrolled them
o-o
with soldiers.
sentence-next
o-o
They built aqueducts
o-o
to channel water
o-o
to cities.
sentence-next
o-o
All of that
o-o
greatly increased
o-o
the efficiency
o-o
of their economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
sentence-next
o-o
Economic
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Economic
o-o
efficiency
o-o
means something
o-o
different.
sentence-next
o-o
Here I'm talking
o-o
about efficiency
o-o
as a general
o-o
concept,
o-o
where profits
o-o
go up
o-o
when costs
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
costs went down
o-o
when those
o-o
Romans wasted
o-o
less time
o-o
being sick
o-o
because they washed
o-o
their hands in
o-o
clean water
o-o
they didn't
o-o
have to
o-o
waste time
o-o
carrying.
sentence-next
o-o
And they wasted
o-o
less money at
o-o
Nero's
o-o
Flaming
o-o
Cartwheel
o-o
stores
o-o
because of
o-o
better roads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And there was
o-o
less cheating.
sentence-next
o-o
Those inspectors,
o-o
backed up by
o-o
soldiers,
o-o
made sure that
o-o
merchants
o-o
didn't use
o-o
lighter weights
o-o
to measure
o-o
what they sell,
o-o
and heavier weights
o-o
to measure what
o-o
the customer
o-o
pays in
o-o
silver or gems
o-o
or grain.
sentence-next
o-o
That was a big
o-o
kind of corruption
o-o
in those days.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And soldiers
o-o
patrolling
o-o
the better roads
o-o
meant there
o-o
was less
o-o
highway
o-o
robbery
o-o
by bad
o-o
Samaritans.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Less time wasted.
sentence-next
o-o
Less stealing.
sentence-next
o-o
Less corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
Slower highways.
sentence-next
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
corruption
o-o
is like tying
o-o
left and right
o-o
shoelaces together.
sentence-next
o-o
That
o-o
suppresses
o-o
successful
o-o
progress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is making
o-o
sense to me.
sentence-next
o-o
Less corruption
o-o
means that
o-o
more time,
o-o
and more money,
o-o
goes into
o-o
building things,
o-o
and buying things,
o-o
that are
o-o
valuable,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
There will be
o-o
lots more
o-o
efficiency.
sentence-next
o-o
And
o-o
productivity.
sentence-next
o-o
Which increases
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That will be
o-o
widespread
o-o
prosperity,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not just for 
o-o
the filthy rich,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
that fits the
o-o
pattern of
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
Another
o-o
important
o-o
ingredient
o-o
is to have less
o-o
fighting.
sentence-next
o-o
Not only less
o-o
physical
o-o
fighting,
o-o
but fewer
o-o
business disputes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
fighting
o-o
wastes
o-o
resources,
o-o
money,
o-o
and time.
sentence-next
o-o
Not just
o-o
lives.
end-lyric
