name-econhist-nickname no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sure,
o-o
that's better
o-o
than spellcheck
o-o
insults.
sentence-next
o-o
Welcome to my
o-o
modest
o-o
office.
sentence-next
o-o
Would you like
o-o
pistachios?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That would be
o-o
a pay raise
o-o
because now I get
o-o
peanuts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We're wired on
o-o
espresso.
sentence-next
o-o
So let's go!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm hungry
o-o
to learn.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We came to learn
o-o
the dark arts
o-o
of economics.
sentence-next
o-o
Please tell us
o-o
what will happen
o-o
in the world
o-o
of money
o-o
when elections
o-o
are fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
When vote splitting
o-o
is no longer
o-o
skewing
o-o
the outcome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not goat
o-o
spitting.
sentence-next
o-o
It's vote
o-o
splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We know
o-o
...
o-o
it's super
o-o
challenging
o-o
...
o-o
to predict
o-o
the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's mostly what
o-o
us economists
o-o
are paid to do.
sentence-next
o-o
Predict
o-o
the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are they,
o-o
well you too,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
usually right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sometimes yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we use our
o-o
success
o-o
to rise up
o-o
in our
o-o
academic
o-o
game of thrones,
o-o
such as getting
o-o
tenure.
sentence-next
o-o
Or a better
o-o
office.
sentence-next
o-o
Sometimes no,
o-o
so we apply
o-o
for a
o-o
research grant
o-o
to study why
o-o
we were wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you get paid more
o-o
if you're wrong?
sentence-next
o-o
Your office window
o-o
doesn't have
o-o
much of a view.
sentence-next
o-o
So I'm guessing
o-o
your crystal ball
o-o
has some cracks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
your espresso
o-o
is showing.
sentence-next
o-o
Professor,
o-o
do you have a
o-o
general notion
o-o
about what will
o-o
change?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
in Washington.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course!
sentence-next
o-o
New laws
o-o
will outlaw
o-o
lots of
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And there will be
o-o
tax reforms
o-o
and other
o-o
new laws
o-o
that will
o-o
unblock
o-o
overdue
o-o
innovations.
sentence-next
o-o
Those changes will
o-o
dramatically
o-o
increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for the
o-o
United States.
sentence-next
o-o
Or for any states
o-o
that adopt
o-o
those reforms.
sentence-next
o-o
You're aware
o-o
there's lots of
o-o
corruption,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Oh yes!
sentence-next
o-o
That's
o-o
why we're here.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's your
o-o
justification?
sentence-next
o-o
For that prediction?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That trend has been
o-o
going on
o-o
throughout
o-o
civilization
o-o
and history.
sentence-next
o-o
Not counting
o-o
setbacks
o-o
caused by
o-o
large hyphen-here scale
o-o
stupidity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Which kinds of
o-o
stupidity?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Civil wars
o-o
and
o-o
world wars.
sentence-next
o-o
And setbacks in
o-o
democracy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why will
o-o
prosperity
o-o
increase?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Imagine
o-o
the economy
o-o
as a
o-o
strawberry
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Sweet pies
o-o
are tasty,
o-o
but not filling.
sentence-next
o-o
I'd rather fight
o-o
for a pie
o-o
with meat.
sentence-next
o-o
How about a
o-o
chicken
o-o
pot pie?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a mouthful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Okay,
o-o
then
o-o
savory pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
So imagine
o-o
the economy
o-o
is a savory pie.
sentence-next
o-o
If some people
o-o
cut themselves
o-o
a slice that's
o-o
too big,
o-o
then other
o-o
people end up with
o-o
smaller slices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm following this.
sentence-next
o-o
Wow!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What would you like
o-o
to call the people
o-o
who take too big
o-o
of a slice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
People in the
o-o
political down.
sentence-next
o-o
As opposed to the
o-o
political left
o-o
and political
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And we
o-o
the people,
o-o
who get too little,
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Bravo!
sentence-next
o-o
I'll bet you
o-o
had to struggle
o-o
to get your
o-o
bearings
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
jungle.
sentence-next
o-o
So,
o-o
the way I see it,
o-o
if elections
o-o
were fair,
o-o
then elected
o-o
leaders
o-o
would care
o-o
more about
o-o
the people
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up,
o-o
where most
o-o
of us are,
o-o
who get too little
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the part
o-o
we've figured
o-o
out.
sentence-next
o-o
And that
o-o
replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
wouldn't lie
o-o
...
o-o
as much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some
o-o
politicians
o-o
will be replaced.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones who stay
o-o
will shift their
o-o
priorities
o-o
to better match
o-o
voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Makes sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Without being
o-o
handcuffed
o-o
by their
o-o
biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
they'll be free
o-o
to do what we,
o-o
the majority
o-o
of voters,
o-o
want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course some
o-o
politicians
o-o
lack souls.
sentence-next
o-o
They'll
o-o
persist
o-o
in being
o-o
ass ...,
o-o
er,
o-o
jerks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When Congress
o-o
and state
o-o
legislatures
o-o
better represent
o-o
what voters want,
o-o
they will pass laws
o-o
that reduce
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And they will
o-o
pass those
o-o
tax reforms
o-o
and other laws
o-o
I mentioned.
sentence-next
o-o
All of that
o-o
will create more
o-o
savory pies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I would jump to
o-o
the second
o-o
or third pie
o-o
right away
o-o
to get my
o-o
fair share.
sentence-next
o-o
And I have to say,
o-o
so far
o-o
this is
o-o
easier
o-o
than playing
o-o
air guitar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When I took
o-o
basic
o-o
economics
o-o
it wasn't
o-o
this fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We'll get to some
o-o
complicated
o-o
bits swiftly,
o-o
and they involve
o-o
bits of
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This might be
o-o
tricky
o-o
for me
o-o
because my memory
o-o
is faulty
o-o
about things
o-o
that happened
o-o
before I
o-o
was conceived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Rather than facts,
o-o
what's more useful
o-o
regarding
o-o
history
o-o
is causation.
sentence-next
o-o
Cause and effect.
sentence-next
o-o
Insights
o-o
about the ones
o-o
in feedback loops
o-o
are especially
o-o
useful.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you know
o-o
what a feedback
o-o
loop is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Going back
o-o
for seconds
o-o
and thirds
o-o
at an
o-o
all hyphen-here you hyphen-here can hyphen-here eat
o-o
buffet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You're stuck
o-o
in the wrong
o-o
orbit.
sentence-next
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
is what makes
o-o
a hurricane
o-o
so powerful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lots of hot air?
sentence-next
o-o
There's lots of it
o-o
in politics.
sentence-next
o-o
It's in
o-o
economics
o-o
too?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No,
o-o
you airhead!
sentence-next
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
is when a
o-o
sequence of
o-o
causes
o-o
and effects
o-o
loop back
o-o
to form
o-o
a circle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Before I get
o-o
dizzy,
o-o
let's start
o-o
with cause
o-o
and effect.
sentence-next
o-o
Is that okay?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sure.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's start with the
o-o
nineteen fifties
o-o
and nineteen sixties
o-o
and into the
o-o
nineteen seventies.
sentence-next
o-o
Why was the
o-o
U.S.
o-o
economy
o-o
so
o-o
prosperous?
end-lyric
