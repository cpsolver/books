academic
o-o
game of thrones,
o-o
such as getting

o-o
Especially

in Washington.
end-lyric

Of course!
sentence-next
o-o
New laws
o-o
will outlaw
o-o
lots of
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And there will be
o-o
tax reforms
o-o
and other
o-o
new laws
o-o
that will
o-o
unblock
o-o
overdue
o-o
innovations.

and
o-o
international
o-o
warfare.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can you
o-o
explain why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Imagine the economy
o-o
as a strawberry pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not fond of
o-o
strawberry pie.
sentence-next
o-o
And apple pie
o-o
is tasteless
o-o
to me as a
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Can we make it
o-o
tastier
o-o
and fill it
o-o
with cherries?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course. Now
o-o
imagine the economy
o-o
is a cherry pie.
sentence-next
o-o
If some people
o-o
cut themselves
o-o
a slice that is
o-o
too big, then other

people end up with
o-o
smaller slices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm following this.
sentence-next
o-o
Wow!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What would you like
o-o
to call the people
o-o
who take too big
o-o
of a slice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
People in the
o-o
political down.
sentence-next
o-o
As opposed to the
o-o
political left
o-o
'n political
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'N we
o-o
the people,
o-o
who get too little,
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Bravo!
sentence-next
o-o
I'll bet you
o-o
had to struggle
o-o
to get your
o-o
bearings
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
jungle.
sentence-next
o-o
So,
o-o
the way I see it,
o-o
if elections
o-o
were fair,
o-o
then elected
o-o
leaders
o-o
would care
o-o
more about
o-o
the people
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up,
o-o
where most
o-o
of us are,
o-o
who get too little
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the part
o-o
we've figured
o-o
out.
sentence-next
o-o
And that
o-o
replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
wouldn't lie
o-o
...
o-o
as much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some
o-o
politicians
o-o
will be replaced.
sentence-next
o-o
Other politicians
o-o
will get re hyphen-here elected
o-o
because they will
o-o
shift their
o-o
priorities
o-o
to better match
o-o
voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Makes sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Currently
o-o
they're
o-o
handcuffed
o-o
by their
o-o
biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
sentence-next
o-o
The shift will
o-o
set them free
o-o
to do what we,
o-o
the majority
o-o
of voters want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course some
o-o
politicians
o-o
lack souls.
sentence-next
o-o
They'll
o-o
persist
o-o
in being
o-o
ass ...,
o-o
er,
o-o
jerks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And remember
o-o
those tax reforms
o-o
and other laws
o-o
I mentioned.
o-o
Those will do
o-o
what amounts to
o-o
creating
o-o
more
o-o
cherry pies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'd jump to
o-o
the second
o-o
and third pies
o-o
right away.
sentence-next
o-o
And I have to say,
o-o
so far
o-o
this is
o-o
easier
o-o
than playing
o-o
air guitar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When I took
o-o
economics
o-o
one oh one,
o-o
it wasn't
o-o
this fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We'll get to some
o-o
complicated
o-o
bits swiftly,
o-o
and they involve
o-o
bits of
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This might be
o-o
tricky
o-o
'cause my memory
o-o
is faulty
o-o
about things
o-o
that happened
o-o
before I
o-o
was around.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Rather than facts,
o-o
what's more useful
o-o
regarding
o-o
history
o-o
is causation.
sentence-next
o-o
Cause and effect.
sentence-next
o-o

o-o
about the ones

o-o
useful.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you know
o-o
what a feedback
o-o
loop is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Going back
o-o
for seconds
o-o
and thirds
o-o
at an
o-o
all hyphen-here you hyphen-here can hyphen-here eat
o-o
buffet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You're stuck
o-o
in the wrong
o-o
loop.
sentence-next
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
is what makes
o-o
a hurricane
o-o
so powerful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lots of hot air?
sentence-next
o-o
There's lots of it
o-o
in politics.
sentence-next
o-o
It's in
o-o
economics
o-o
too?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No,
o-o
you airhead!
sentence-next
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
is when a cause
o-o
and effect
o-o
becomes
o-o
a circle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can we start
o-o
with cause
o-o
and effect?
sentence-next
o-o
The economic
o-o
kind?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sure.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's start with the
o-o
nineteen fifties
o-o
and nineteen sixties
o-o
and into the
o-o
nineteen seventies.
sentence-next
o-o
Why was the
o-o
U.S.
o-o
economy
o-o
so
o-o
prosperous?
