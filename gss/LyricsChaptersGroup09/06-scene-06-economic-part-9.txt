If I could get
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It takes
o-o
lots of money
o-o
to protect
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought
o-o
getting a patent
o-o
was the hard part.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's just a start.
sentence-next
o-o
If it's a
o-o
valuable
o-o
idea
o-o
then other
o-o
businesses
o-o
will infringe on
o-o
your patent.
sentence-next
o-o
So you have to
o-o
take them to court
o-o
to protect your
o-o
monopoly.
sentence-next
o-o
And patent laws
o-o
favor big
o-o
corporations.
sentence-next
o-o
And China
o-o
mostly
o-o
ignores
o-o
patents.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sucks.
sentence-next
o-o
Is there a way
o-o
to ...,
o-o
I don't know,
o-o
to win in
o-o
the business
o-o
world?
sentence-next
o-o
For someone
o-o
like me?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The open patent
o-o
I mentioned
o-o
will help.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If it existed
o-o
you could afford
o-o
to register
o-o
your idea with
o-o
the patent office
o-o
without mortgaging
o-o
your house to pay
o-o
for a patent
o-o
attorney.
sentence-next
o-o
You'd get a
o-o
patent number.
sentence-next
o-o
You'd add it to
o-o
your LinkedIn
o-o
profile.
sentence-next
o-o
Then
o-o
corporations
o-o
would compete
o-o
to hire you
o-o
to invent
o-o
yet more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
At a big salary!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That path doesn't
o-o
yet exist.
sentence-next
o-o
So what should
o-o
I do?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Currently
o-o
corporations
o-o
don't know how to
o-o
hire, or even
o-o
recognize,
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses.
sentence-next
o-o
Not until

after they've

co hyphen-here founder of
o-o
a wildly
o-o
successful
o-o
start up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a very

to climb.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, alas.
sentence-next
o-o
Under current
o-o
conditions
o-o
only hindsight
o-o
reveals who's
o-o
a creative
o-o
genius.
sentence-next
o-o
When that
o-o
inefficiency
o-o
gets solved,
o-o
that will increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
so dramatically
o-o
it will change
o-o
the economy
o-o
from a roller
o-o
coaster ride
o-o
into a rocket
o-o
ship blasting
o-o
into outer
o-o
space.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't most people
o-o
creative?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's like with art.
sentence-next
o-o
Thousands of
o-o
painters
o-o
have painted
o-o
portraits in
o-o
very creative
o-o
styles.
sentence-next
o-o
But the
o-o
Mona Lisa
o-o
stands out
o-o
as a style
o-o
that's not just
o-o
different.
sentence-next
o-o
It's also widely
o-o
appreciated
o-o
by millions
o-o
of people.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, that's why
o-o
you use the word
o-o
genius
o-o
after the word
o-o
creative?
sentence-next
o-o
'Cause the word
o-o
creative just
o-o
means different?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
alas,
o-o
most business
o-o
managers
o-o
don't understand
o-o
the different
o-o
meanings of
o-o
the word
o-o
creative.
sentence-next
o-o
And the word
o-o
innovation
o-o
also gets
o-o
misunderstood.
sentence-next
o-o
The value
o-o
of a product
o-o
or a person
o-o
becomes clear
o-o
only in hindsight,
o-o
not at the time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So solutions
o-o
are waiting
o-o
for when there's less
o-o
stupidity
o-o
in politics,

business, and
o-o
management.

That's a

o-o
Is there any hope?

o-o
For a fairer

economy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Look at history.
sentence-next
o-o
Civilization
o-o
has increased
o-o
efficiency
o-o
so much that
o-o
us average
o-o
folks don't waste
o-o
big parts of
o-o
our day
o-o
hauling water,

gathering firewood,
o-o
tending horses,
o-o
and pounding
o-o
underwear

against rocks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now we waste
o-o
too much time
o-o
sitting in cars

o-o
dealing with
o-o
paperwork

o-o
cooking in

watching ads

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Those time wasters
o-o
and other
o-o
inefficiencies
o-o
in the economy
o-o
will disappear
o-o
after we adopt
o-o
better laws.
sentence-next
o-o
But that requires
o-o
increasing
o-o
the influence
o-o
of voters,
o-o
and decreasing
o-o
the influence
o-o
of money in
o-o
politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm discouraged

by the setbacks.

The ones going on

politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In the past
o-o
there've been

huge setbacks too.
sentence-next
o-o
Much bigger ones.
sentence-next
o-o
The ancient Greeks

two thousand

One of those

Antikythera.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Who was the

creative genius
o-o
behind that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Probably either
o-o
Posidonius
o-o
or Hipparchus.
sentence-next
o-o
Sadly,
o-o
warfare killed

their knowledge.
sentence-next
o-o
Those kinds of

weren't

developed

until the

o-o
In a similar way,

the footsteps

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's so sad.
end-lyric

Yet when times

o-o
more people say

We've had enough!

That's where

Solutions

World war three
o-o
is widely

a very stupid

idea,

So there's time

to get

o-o
And doing that

what early

North American
o-o
colonists
o-o
had to do
o-o
to get
o-o
democracy.
sentence-next
o-o
They had to fight
o-o
with physical

weapons.
sentence-next
o-o
And they won
o-o
mostly because
o-o
France and Spain
o-o
and the Dutch

England at
o-o
the same time
o-o
the thirteen

Now the fights

Those fights

And they're

You've shown us

I now understand
