ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain freeze
o-o
big time!
sentence-next
o-o
Is that difference
o-o
really of prime
o-o
importance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To get the math
o-o
right, yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But both types
o-o
are better than
o-o
what we use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't anything
o-o
better than what
o-o
we use now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost anything.
sentence-next
o-o
There's one
o-o
seductive
o-o
exception.
sentence-next
o-o
That's giving
o-o
each voter
o-o
a limited
o-o
number of points
o-o
to distribute
o-o
among the
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that because
o-o
a jerk could give
o-o
all his points
o-o
to a single
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's one
o-o
of its flaws.
sentence-next
o-o
If vote counting
o-o
methods
o-o
competed in
o-o
a limbo contest,
o-o
that points approach
o-o
would win.
sentence-next
o-o
It goes the
o-o
lowest
o-o
in fairness.
sentence-next
o-o
Anything else
o-o
is like
o-o
pole vaulting
o-o
over what we
o-o
use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So using ballots
o-o
that are like
o-o
Amazon stars ....
sentence-next
o-o
Wait a moment.
sentence-next
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
voting has to be
o-o
done electronically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That wouldn't
o-o
be fair.
sentence-next
o-o
Someone
o-o
could get lots
o-o
of extra votes
o-o
by changing
o-o
their name to
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Plus voting
o-o
machines
o-o
can be hacked.
sentence-next
o-o
And lots of
o-o
people vote
o-o
by mail.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what my
o-o
brother did
o-o
when he was
o-o
fighting in
o-o
the Middle East.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Paper ballots,
o-o
with ovals to mark,
o-o
work just fine.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course
o-o
columns of ovals
o-o
are needed for the
o-o
preference levels.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's say there's
o-o
seven columns.
sentence-next
o-o
The columns
o-o
would be labeled
o-o
begin-italics first choice end-italics no-space ,
o-o
begin-italics second choice end-italics no-space ,
o-o
begin-italics third choice end-italics no-space ,
o-o
and so on up to
o-o
begin-italics seventh choice end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
That's called
o-o
a ranked choice
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What happens
o-o
if a joker
o-o
or dumb ass
o-o
marks more than
o-o
one oval
o-o
for the same
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Just count
o-o
the highest rank.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Suppose a
o-o
distracted
o-o
voter forgets
o-o
to mark
o-o
any of a
o-o
candidate's
o-o
ovals?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That candidate
o-o
is ranked at
o-o
the bottom.
sentence-next
o-o
In this case
o-o
that's the
o-o
begin-italics
seventh choice
end-italics
no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What happens
o-o
if I rank
o-o
two
o-o
candidates
o-o
at the same
o-o
choice level?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That can be
o-o
counted
o-o
correctly,
o-o
as long as
o-o
lazy counting
o-o
shortcuts
o-o
aren't involved.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think even
o-o
I could mark
o-o
that kind of
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Anyone who can't
o-o
is too stupid
o-o
to be voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You're sayin'
o-o
some ways
o-o
of counting
o-o
these ballots
o-o
are better
o-o
than others?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly!
sentence-next
o-o
If everyone is
o-o
honest, then
o-o
simple counting
o-o
works fine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Simple counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If there are
o-o
five choice columns,
o-o
a marked oval
o-o
in the begin-italics first choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
five Amazon stars,
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics second choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
four Amazon stars,
o-o
and so on down to
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics fifth choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
one Amazon star.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's simple?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A computer
o-o
would take care of
o-o
converting
o-o
prefererence
o-o
levels
o-o
and counting
o-o
stars.
sentence-next
o-o
You would just mark
o-o
the correct column
o-o
for each
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Even
o-o
hand counting,
o-o
without a
o-o
computer,
o-o
can be done.
sentence-next
o-o
Using this simple
o-o
counting method
o-o
with five
o-o
candidates
o-o
and five
o-o
preference
o-o
levels
o-o
would produce
o-o
fair results
o-o
if everyone
o-o
ranked or rated
o-o
just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
at each level,
o-o
and if
o-o
everyone
o-o
was honest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Fat chance of that!
sentence-next
o-o
Honesty I mean.
sentence-next
o-o
It seems to be
o-o
getting
o-o
less and less
o-o
fashionable
o-o
in YouTube
o-o
videos,
o-o
the healthcare
o-o
industry,
o-o
and in
o-o
Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes when money
o-o
is involved,
o-o
as it is in
o-o
politics,
o-o
that simple way
o-o
of counting
o-o
ratings is
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to strategic
o-o
voters.
sentence-next
o-o
They can get
o-o
extra
o-o
influence
o-o
using the
o-o
clapping tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
By avoiding
o-o
the middle
o-o
preference
o-o
levels?
sentence-next
o-o
And mostly
o-o
using the
o-o
highest
o-o
and lowest
o-o
levels?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm curious.
sentence-next
o-o
What happens
o-o
when Amazon
o-o
customers
o-o
realize they
o-o
can get extra
o-o
influence by
o-o
skipping the
o-o
middle ratings?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Amazon
o-o
stopped using
o-o
simple counting,
o-o
so it's less
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to that
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm confused.
sentence-next
o-o
I understand
o-o
how the ballots work.
sentence-next
o-o
But I can't
o-o
imagine a
o-o
way to count votes
o-o
that's not like
o-o
any of what we've
o-o
been discussing.
sentence-next
o-o
I thought I was
o-o
following,
o-o
but now I've
o-o
stumbled up
o-o
another
o-o
dark alley.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Take a deep breath!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-explain Takes deep breath. end-explain
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-explain Takes deep breath. end-explain
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And give yourself
o-o
an A plus!
sentence-next
o-o
You two are
o-o
learning more
o-o
and faster
o-o
than anyone else
o-o
I've tried to
o-o
explain this to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Really?
sentence-next
o-o
Or are you just
o-o
tryin' to, well,
o-o
I dunno.
sentence-next
o-o
This is so
o-o
different from
o-o
that teacher
o-o
who bonked my head
o-o
with a book
o-o
every time
o-o
I made a
o-o
mistake.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Tell me who did that
o-o
and I'll bonk him
o-o
in the balls.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This is different
o-o
because you
o-o
really care about
o-o
this topic.
sentence-next
o-o
That's really what
o-o
makes the difference
o-o
between good and
o-o
bad grades.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My world is
o-o
upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
'N money's
o-o
on the line.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And Congress
o-o
is filled with
o-o
swine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Let's keep goin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said the
o-o
five star Amazon
o-o
kind of ballot
o-o
has two names.
sentence-next
o-o
Which name applies
o-o
to the kind of
o-o
simple counting
o-o
we've been talking
o-o
about?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That kind of
o-o
ballot is asking
o-o
for a score
o-o
or a rating.
sentence-next
o-o
It's called
o-o
a score ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
It allows a voter
o-o
to indicate
o-o
how strongly the
o-o
voter feels about
o-o
who they like and
o-o
dislike.
sentence-next
o-o
Like the grades
o-o
A through F.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Most politicians
o-o
deserve an F,
o-o
for
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
fails to care
o-o
about most
o-o
voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We gotta
o-o
grade 'em
o-o
on a curve.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'N that's why
o-o
marking just the
o-o
highest and
o-o
lowest scores,
o-o
is such a
o-o
big deal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
because some
o-o
voters will use
o-o
the clapping
o-o
tactic
o-o
and others
o-o
won't.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how should we
o-o
be countin'
o-o
ballots?
sentence-next
o-o
For elections.
sentence-next
o-o
Where voters
o-o
will try
o-o
to increase
o-o
their influence.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Before we
o-o
move on to
o-o
better ways to
o-o
count those
o-o
better ballots,
o-o
here's an
o-o
interesting
o-o
simple kind of
o-o
improvement.
