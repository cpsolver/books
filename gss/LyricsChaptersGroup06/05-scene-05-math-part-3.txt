Brain freeze
o-o
big time!
sentence-next
o-o
Is that difference
o-o
really of prime
o-o
importance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To get the math
o-o
right, yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But both types
o-o
are better than
o-o
what we use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't anything
o-o
better than what
o-o
we use now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost anything.
sentence-next
o-o
There's one
o-o
seductive
o-o
exception.
sentence-next
o-o
That's giving
o-o
each voter
o-o
a limited
o-o
number of points
o-o
to distribute
o-o
among the
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that because
o-o
a jerk could give
o-o
all his points
o-o
to a single
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's one
o-o
of its flaws.
sentence-next
o-o
If vote counting
o-o
methods
o-o
competed in
o-o
a limbo contest,
o-o
that points approach
o-o
would win.
sentence-next
o-o
It goes the
o-o
lowest
o-o
in fairness.
sentence-next
o-o
Anything else
o-o
is like
o-o
pole vaulting
o-o
over what we
o-o
use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So using ballots
o-o
that are like
o-o
Amazon stars ....
sentence-next
o-o
Wait a moment.
sentence-next
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
voting has to be
o-o
done electronically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That wouldn't
o-o
be fair.
sentence-next
o-o
Someone
o-o
could get lots

of extra votes
o-o
by changing

That's what my

Paper ballots,
o-o
with ovals to mark,
o-o
work just fine.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course
o-o
columns of ovals
o-o
are needed for the
o-o
preference levels.
sentence-next
o-o
And each
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets one row
o-o
of ovals.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Columns?
sentence-next
o-o
Rows?
sentence-next
o-o
My brain is
o-o
getting dizzy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What we use now,
o-o
the single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot,
o-o
the paper kind,
o-o
has one column
o-o
of ovals.
sentence-next
o-o
The column
o-o
runs up and down,
o-o
vertically.
sentence-next
o-o
We need to add
o-o
more columns
o-o
so that each
o-o
candidate
o-o
has its own row.
sentence-next
o-o
Each row
o-o
runs left to right,
o-o
horizontally,
o-o
like Amazon stars.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Columns are
o-o
vertical.
sentence-next
o-o
Rows are
o-o
horizontal.
sentence-next
o-o
So that's
o-o
a grid
o-o
of ovals,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Right.
sentence-next
o-o
And candidate
o-o
names
o-o
are still
o-o
on the left.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's say there's
o-o
seven columns.
sentence-next
o-o
The columns

o-o
begin-italics first choice end-italics no-space ,
o-o
begin-italics second choice end-italics no-space ,
o-o
begin-italics third choice end-italics no-space ,

and so on up to

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is this what's called
o-o
ranked choice voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes and no.
sentence-next
o-o
Different
o-o
people
o-o
use the words
o-o
begin-italics ranked choice voting end-italics
o-o
to mean different
o-o
things.
sentence-next
o-o
But those
o-o
differences
o-o
won't make sense
o-o
just yet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On this ranked
o-o
choice ballot,
o-o
what happens
o-o
when a joker
o-o
or dumb ass
o-o
marks more than
o-o
one oval
o-o
for the same
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Just count
o-o
the highest rank
o-o
in that row.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Suppose a
o-o
distracted
o-o
voter forgets
o-o
to mark
o-o
any of a
o-o
candidate's
o-o
ovals?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That candidate
o-o
is ranked at
o-o
the bottom
o-o
choice level.
sentence-next
o-o
Or lower than
o-o
all the ranked ones.
sentence-next
o-o
Depending on
o-o
how write hyphen-here in
o-o
candidates
o-o
are handled.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What happens
o-o
if I rank
o-o
begin-italics two end-italics
o-o
candidates
o-o
at the same
o-o
choice level?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That can be
o-o
counted
o-o
correctly,
o-o
as long as
o-o
lazy counting
o-o
shortcuts
o-o
aren't involved.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think even
o-o
I could mark
o-o
that kind of
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Anyone who can't
o-o
is too stupid
o-o
to be voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how should
o-o
this ballot
o-o
be counted?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Some people
o-o
will suggest
o-o
keeping the
o-o
counting
o-o
as simple
o-o
as possible.
sentence-next
o-o
But those
o-o
approaches
o-o
do not work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm a simpleton
o-o
so I can't
o-o
imagine
o-o
even simple
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Centuries ago
o-o
some people
o-o
suggested
o-o
giving
o-o
the most points
o-o
for a mark
o-o
in the left column,
o-o
one point
o-o
for a mark
o-o
in the right column,
o-o
and in hyphen-here between
o-o
points to marks
o-o
in the in hyphen-here between
o-o
columns.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said points
o-o
don't work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That involved
o-o
setting a limit
o-o
on the number
o-o
of marked ovals.
sentence-next
o-o
This kind of points
o-o
is different.
sentence-next
o-o
If somehow
o-o
voters
o-o
could be forced
o-o
to vote honestly,
o-o
and also
o-o
to follow rules
o-o
to mark only
o-o
one oval
o-o
in each column,
o-o
and only one oval
o-o
in each row,
o-o
then the
o-o
candidate
o-o
with the most
o-o
total points
o-o
would deserve
o-o
to win.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Fat chance of that!
sentence-next
o-o
Honesty I mean.
sentence-next
o-o
It's getting
o-o
less and less
o-o
fashionable
o-o
in YouTube
o-o
videos,
o-o
Congress,
o-o
and online
o-o
dating.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And those strict rules?
o-o
That countin'
o-o
method's dead.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet it
o-o
demonstrates
o-o
that simplicity
o-o
in counting
o-o
yields complexity
o-o
in marking
o-o
ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Our priority
o-o
must be
o-o
to keep voting
o-o
simple for voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the best
o-o
counting
o-o
methods
o-o
are complex.
sentence-next
o-o
Aiee!

I've tried to

ambee sings-damien amenn
Really?
sentence-next
o-o
Or are you just
o-o
tryin' to, well,
o-o
I dunno.
sentence-next
o-o
This is so
o-o
different from

that teacher
o-o
who bonked my head

with a book
o-o
every time
o-o
I made a
o-o
mistake.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Tell me who did that
o-o
and I'll bonk him
o-o
in the balls.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This is different
o-o
because you
o-o
really care about

this topic.
sentence-next

That's really what

makes the difference
o-o
between good and
