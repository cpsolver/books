Yet just
o-o
collecting

more information

isn't enough.

o-o
How the information

is counted to

identify a

important to

o-o
Because of

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I should
o-o
clarify.
sentence-next
o-o
There are
o-o
two parts

to any

voting method.
sentence-next
o-o
There's the ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's the

counting of those
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What kind'a ballot
o-o
do we use
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Most simple
o-o
elections
o-o
in most nations
o-o
use what's
o-o
increasingly
o-o
called the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'Cause we can
o-o
only mark a
o-o
single choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course.
sentence-next
o-o
There's just
o-o
one way
o-o
to count
o-o
a single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot
o-o
if it's a
o-o
simple election.
sentence-next
o-o
So until
o-o
recently
o-o
that ballot didn't
o-o
have a name.
sentence-next
o-o
The counting method
o-o
has different names.
sentence-next
o-o
It's the enemy
o-o
of fair voting
o-o
so it's worth
o-o
learning its names.
sentence-next
o-o
In the academic
o-o
world it's called
o-o
begin-italics plurality voting end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
In Canada
o-o
and other
o-o
British places
o-o
it's called
o-o
begin-italics first past the post end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it called
o-o
here in the states?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's just called
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah!
sentence-next
o-o
With no name
o-o
it becomes harder
o-o
to fight against!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that's the

enemy?
sentence-next
o-o
Plurality?
sentence-next
o-o
And it uses
o-o
the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Using those for
o-o
democracy
o-o
is like

using a stick

attached to
o-o
a round piece of

cardboard
o-o
as an

umbrella.
sentence-next
o-o
It works

What's the name
o-o
of a ballot where
o-o
each candidate
o-o
can be ranked at
o-o
a different level,
o-o
like on Amazon?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Academically
o-o
that's called a
o-o
ranked choice ballot,
o-o
or a score ballot,
o-o
depending on
o-o
how it's
o-o
labeled
o-o
and how it's
o-o
counted.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain freeze
o-o
big time!
sentence-next
o-o
Is that difference
o-o
really of prime
o-o
importance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To get the math
o-o
right, yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet ranking
o-o
and scoring
o-o
are both
o-o
much better than
o-o
what we use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't anything
o-o
better than what
o-o
we use now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost anything.
sentence-next
o-o
There's one
o-o
seductive
o-o
exception.
sentence-next
o-o
That's giving
o-o
each voter
o-o
a limited
o-o
number of points
o-o
to distribute
o-o
among the
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that because
o-o
a jerk could give
o-o
all his points
o-o
to a single
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's one
o-o
of its flaws.
sentence-next
o-o
If vote counting
o-o
methods
o-o
competed in

a limbo contest,
o-o
that points approach
o-o
would win.
sentence-next
o-o
It goes the
o-o
lowest
o-o
in fairness.
sentence-next
o-o
Anything else
o-o
is like
o-o
pole vaulting
o-o
over what we
o-o
use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So using ballots
o-o
that are like
o-o
Amazon stars ....
sentence-next
o-o
Wait a moment.
sentence-next
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
voting has to be
o-o
done electronically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That wouldn't
o-o
be fair.
sentence-next
o-o

What we use now,

the single hyphen-here choice

ballot,

the paper kind,

has one column

of ovals.
sentence-next
o-o
The column

runs up and down,

vertically.
sentence-next
o-o
We need to add

more columns

sentence-next
o-o
Each row
