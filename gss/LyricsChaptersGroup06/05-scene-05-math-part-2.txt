ambee sings-damien amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I know
o-o
fractions
o-o
are just
o-o
a lazy way
o-o
to handle
o-o
division.
sentence-next
o-o
And a sneaky
o-o
way to hide
o-o
division
o-o
behind a
o-o
disguise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Other words
o-o
that disguise
o-o
division
o-o
are the words
o-o
ratio,
o-o
rate,
o-o
proportion,
o-o
average,
o-o
percentage,
o-o
percent, and
o-o
the word per.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I wish my
o-o
elementary
o-o
teachers
o-o
long ago
o-o
had taught
o-o
these concepts
o-o
so quickly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas.
sentence-next
o-o
We have to teach
o-o
what's in
o-o
textbooks,
o-o
and what's
o-o
on standardized
o-o
exams.
sentence-next
o-o
Even though
o-o
foundational
o-o
key concepts
o-o
are more
o-o
important than
o-o
memorization.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
now that
o-o
Siri and
o-o
Alexa 
o-o
can ace every
o-o
geography
o-o
exam,
o-o
win every
o-o
spelling bee,
o-o
and add fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I learned to spell
o-o
begin-italics hypotenuse end-italics
o-o
before I learned
o-o
it had nothing
o-o
to do with
o-o
hippos.
sentence-next
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
schools
o-o
are
o-o
flunking
o-o
basic
o-o
education?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
sometimes our
o-o
education
o-o
system
o-o
does seem to
o-o
teach kids
o-o
to gargle
o-o
instead of drink
o-o
at the fountain
o-o
of knowledge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of which,
o-o
now can we switch
o-o
to politics
o-o
from just
o-o
mathematics?
sentence-next
o-o
I'm dumbfounded
o-o
to say this,
o-o
yet I'm eager
o-o
to learn the
o-o
math behind
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
You won't be scared
o-o
when zero
o-o
appears.
sentence-next
o-o
And only one
o-o
very simple
o-o
fraction
o-o
is involved.
sentence-next
o-o
The one called
o-o
half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hurray!
sentence-next
o-o
Even a half wit
o-o
can handle
o-o
a half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's one
o-o
divided
o-o
by two.
sentence-next
o-o
That equals
o-o
zero point five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or fifty
o-o
percent
o-o
when we want to
o-o
avoid the
o-o
decimal point.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're ready!
sentence-next
o-o
So let's explore
o-o
how votes need to
o-o
be counted for
o-o
results to be
o-o
fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So how do you think
o-o
voting should be done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As you know,
o-o
I'm not a
o-o
math wiz.
sentence-next
o-o
Or even a nerd.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
name-damien no-space ?
sentence-next
o-o
What do you
o-o
suppose
o-o
that would
o-o
look like?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Uh,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
I reckon,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
maybe
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
it might use
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
five stars?
sentence-next
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
Like
o-o
Amazon does?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a good start.
sentence-next
o-o
And why is that
o-o
approach smart?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If Amazon used
o-o
just one star
o-o
for each product,
o-o
like on an
o-o
election ballot,
o-o
that wouldn't be
o-o
enough info.
sentence-next
o-o
So what's needed
o-o
in elections
o-o
is more
o-o
info.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes indeed!
sentence-next
o-o
So if stars were
o-o
used in elections,
o-o
and the highest
o-o
count of stars
o-o
indicated
o-o
the winner,
o-o
how could you,
o-o
as a voter,
o-o
get some extra
o-o
influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm feeling
o-o
like a dunce.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's try a
o-o
different
o-o
scenario.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's suppose
o-o
you're in the
o-o
audience at
o-o
a talent contest,
o-o
and the emcee
o-o
announces
o-o
the loudness
o-o
of clapping
o-o
will determine
o-o
who wins.
sentence-next
o-o
How can you get
o-o
extra influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nor do I.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You could clap
o-o
really loud for
o-o
your favorites.
sentence-next
o-o
And just pretend
o-o
to clap for the
o-o
others,
o-o
without making
o-o
any sound.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That would be
o-o
cheating.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a talent
o-o
contest, maybe,
o-o
maybe not.
sentence-next
o-o
At theater
o-o
events, that's
o-o
disrespectful.
sentence-next
o-o
But in an
o-o
election, with
o-o
money on the line,
o-o
that's just freedom
o-o
of expression.
sentence-next
o-o
It's voting,
o-o
but with an unfair
o-o
kind of vote
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, it's fighting!
sentence-next
o-o
Done on ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So when I rate
o-o
things on Amazon
o-o
I should only
o-o
use one star
o-o
or five stars?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you do that
o-o
on Amazon
o-o
you're being a
o-o
jerk.
sentence-next
o-o
But if that star
o-o
rating were used
o-o
in elections,
o-o
where so much
o-o
is at stake,
o-o
that tactic
o-o
would make
o-o
your ballot
o-o
have more impact
o-o
than ballots
o-o
marked
o-o
honestly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That violates
o-o
the principle
o-o
of one person,
o-o
one vote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The best
o-o
counting methods
o-o
don't have that flaw.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet there's
o-o
a simple kind
o-o
of counting
o-o
worth knowing
o-o
about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I like simple.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Consider the same
o-o
kind of ballot
o-o
we use now.
sentence-next
o-o
We can change the
o-o
instructions
o-o
to allow
o-o
the voter
o-o
to mark more than
o-o
just one
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
That's called
o-o
approval
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, because you
o-o
either approve
o-o
each candidate or
o-o
leave their name
o-o
unmarked.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This sounds like
o-o
Facebook.
sentence-next
o-o
Where people
o-o
upvote
o-o
entertaining
o-o
kitten videos
o-o
and awesome
o-o
dance moves.
sentence-next
o-o
And fail to
o-o
upvote the
o-o
real naked truth.
sentence-next
o-o
Well,
o-o
the real truth.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since you
o-o
brought it up,
o-o
I'm guessing,
o-o
approval voting
o-o
might be fair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's useful as
o-o
a simple way
o-o
for friends
o-o
to choose
o-o
a movie.
sentence-next
o-o
Or a book club
o-o
to reduce their
o-o
book choices.
sentence-next
o-o
And it would work
o-o
okay in
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
elections
o-o
because the winner
o-o
would always be from
o-o
the correct party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Approval
o-o
voting seems
o-o
similar to
o-o
everyone
o-o
using the
o-o
clapping tactic.
sentence-next
o-o
Where clapping
o-o
loudly is
o-o
approval.
sentence-next
o-o
And just
o-o
pretending
o-o
to clap
o-o
is disapproval.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly!
sentence-next
o-o
You're understanding
o-o
the concepts
o-o
without getting
o-o
distracted
o-o
by names.
sentence-next
o-o
Bravo!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wouldn't
o-o
just changing
o-o
written
o-o
directions
o-o
on the ballot
o-o
be an easy
o-o
change to make?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I'm not
o-o
politically
o-o
savvy.
sentence-next
o-o
That's outside
o-o
my expertise.
sentence-next
o-o
I just know
o-o
the math behind
o-o
ballot counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On Reddit
o-o
we can upvote
o-o
and downvote.
sentence-next
o-o
That's more
o-o
info.
sentence-next
o-o
Is that
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only if it's
o-o
counted as
o-o
three ranking
o-o
levels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Three?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, an upvote
o-o
is like plus one.
sentence-next
o-o
And a downvote
o-o
is like minus one.
sentence-next
o-o
And neither
o-o
up nor down
o-o
is like zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If counted right
o-o
that could work.
sentence-next
o-o
But using
o-o
five levels
o-o
collects more
o-o
information
o-o
than three.
sentence-next
o-o
And when there are
o-o
lots and lots of
o-o
candidates
o-o
then up to
o-o
about twelve
o-o
preference
o-o
levels
o-o
would work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But not
o-o
unlucky thirteen.
end-lyric
