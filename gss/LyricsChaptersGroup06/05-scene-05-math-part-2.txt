ambee sings-damien amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I know
o-o
fractions
o-o
are just
o-o
a lazy way
o-o
to handle
o-o
division.
sentence-next
o-o
And a sneaky
o-o
way to hide
o-o
division
o-o
behind a
o-o
disguise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Other words
o-o
that disguise
o-o
division
o-o
are the words
o-o
ratio,
o-o
rate,
o-o
proportion,
o-o
average,
o-o
percentage,
o-o
percent, and
o-o
the word per.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I wish my
o-o
elementary
o-o
teachers
o-o
long ago
o-o
had taught
o-o
these concepts
o-o
so quickly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas.
sentence-next
o-o
We have to teach
o-o
what's in
o-o
textbooks,
o-o
and what's
o-o
on standardized
o-o
exams.
sentence-next
o-o
Even though
o-o
foundational
o-o
key concepts
o-o
are more
o-o
important than
o-o
memorizing
o-o
how to add
o-o
two fractions,
o-o
memorizing
o-o
spelling rules,
o-o
and remembering
o-o
historical
o-o
battle details.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I learned to spell
o-o
begin-italics hypotenuse end-italics
o-o
before I learned
o-o
it had nothing
o-o
to do with
o-o
hippos.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's as if
o-o
schools
o-o
try to
o-o
begin-italics program end-italics students.
sentence-next
o-o
As if we were
o-o
computers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Meanwhile,
o-o
businesses
o-o
try to put
o-o
remedial
o-o
artificial
o-o
intelligence
o-o
into computers
o-o
so they can
o-o
fire more workers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Programming
o-o
students
o-o
and putting
o-o
ant hyphen-here brained
o-o
intelligence
o-o
into computers
o-o
is like
o-o
asking
o-o
street dancers
o-o
to sing in a
o-o
symphony
o-o
chorus,
o-o
and asking
o-o
opera singers
o-o
to learn dance
o-o
choreography.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Does this mean
o-o
schools
o-o
are doubly
o-o
flunking
o-o
basic
o-o
education?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
sometimes our
o-o
education
o-o
system
o-o
does seem to
o-o
teach kids
o-o
to gargle
o-o
instead of drink
o-o
at the fountain
o-o
of knowledge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of which,
o-o
now can we switch
o-o
to politics
o-o
from just
o-o
mathematics?
sentence-next
o-o
I'm dumbfounded
o-o
to say this,
o-o
yet I'm eager
o-o
to learn the
o-o
math behind
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
You won't be scared
o-o
when zero
o-o
appears.
sentence-next
o-o
And only one
o-o
very simple
o-o
fraction
o-o
is involved.
sentence-next
o-o
The one called
o-o
half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hurray!
sentence-next
o-o
Even a half wit
o-o
like me
o-o
can handle
o-o
a half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's one
o-o
divided
o-o
by two.
sentence-next
o-o
That equals
o-o
zero point five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or fifty
o-o
percent
o-o
when we want to
o-o
avoid the
o-o
decimal point.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're ready!
sentence-next
o-o
So let's explore
o-o
how votes need to
o-o
be counted for
o-o
results to be
o-o
fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So how do you think
o-o
voting should be done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As you know,
o-o
I'm not a
o-o
math wiz.
sentence-next
o-o
Or even a nerd.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
name-damien no-space ?
sentence-next
o-o
What do you
o-o
suppose
o-o
that would
o-o
look like?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Uh,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
I reckon,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
maybe
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
it might use
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
five stars?
sentence-next
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
Like
o-o
Amazon does?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a good start.
sentence-next
o-o
And why is that
o-o
approach smart?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If Amazon used
o-o
just one star
o-o
for each product,
o-o
like on an
o-o
'lection ballot,
o-o
that wouldn't be
o-o
enough info.
sentence-next
o-o
So what's needed
o-o
in elections
o-o
is more
o-o
info.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes indeed!
sentence-next
o-o
So if stars were
o-o
used in elections,
o-o
and the highest
o-o
count of stars
o-o
indicated
o-o
the winner,
o-o
how could you,
o-o
as a voter,
o-o
get some extra
o-o
influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm feelin'
o-o
like a dunce.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's try a
o-o
different
o-o
scenario.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's suppose
o-o
you're in the
o-o
audience at
o-o
a talent contest,
o-o
and the emcee
o-o
announces
o-o
the loudness
o-o
of clapping
o-o
will determine
o-o
who wins.
sentence-next
o-o
How can you get
o-o
extra influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nor do I.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You could clap
o-o
really loud for
o-o
your favorites.
sentence-next
o-o
And just pretend
o-o
to clap for the
o-o
others,
o-o
without making
o-o
any sound.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be
o-o
cheating.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a talent
o-o
contest, maybe,
o-o
maybe not.
sentence-next
o-o
At theater
o-o
events, that's
o-o
disrespectful.
sentence-next
o-o
But in an
o-o
election, with
o-o
money on the line,
o-o
that's just freedom
o-o
of expression.
sentence-next
o-o
It's voting,
o-o
but with an unfair
o-o
kind of vote
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, it's fighting!
sentence-next
o-o
Done on ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So when I rate
o-o
things on Amazon
o-o
I should only
o-o
use one star
o-o
or five stars?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you do that
o-o
on Amazon
o-o
you're being a
o-o
jerk.
sentence-next
o-o
But if that star
o-o
rating were used
o-o
in elections,
o-o
where so much
o-o
is at stake,
o-o
that tactic
o-o
would make
o-o
your ballot
o-o
have more impact
o-o
than ballots
o-o
marked
o-o
honestly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm curious.
sentence-next
o-o
What happens
o-o
when Amazon
o-o
customers
o-o
realize they
o-o
can get extra
o-o
influence by
o-o
skipping the
o-o
middle ratings?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Amazon
o-o
stopped using
o-o
simple counting,
o-o
so it's less
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to that
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It figures
o-o
Amazon has
o-o
worked out
o-o
those details.
sentence-next
o-o
The ones
o-o
I'm just
o-o
learnin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Before we
o-o
move on to
o-o
counting better
o-o
ballots,
o-o
here's an
o-o
interesting
o-o
simple kind of
o-o
improvement.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I like simple.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Consider the same
o-o
kind of ballot
o-o
we use now, the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
But change the
o-o
instructions.
sentence-next
o-o
Allow the voter
o-o
to mark more than
o-o
just one
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
That's called
o-o
approval
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, because you
o-o
either approve
o-o
each candidate or
o-o
leave their name
o-o
unmarked.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This sounds like
o-o
Facebook.
sentence-next
o-o
Where people
o-o
upvote
o-o
entertaining
o-o
kitten videos
o-o
and awesome
o-o
dance moves.
sentence-next
o-o
And fail to
o-o
upvote the
o-o
real naked truth.
sentence-next
o-o
Well,
o-o
the real truth.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since you
o-o
brought it up,
o-o
I'm guessing,
o-o
approval voting
o-o
might be fair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's useful as
o-o
a simple way
o-o
for friends
o-o
to choose
o-o
a movie.
sentence-next
o-o
And it would work
o-o
OK in
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
elections
o-o
because the winner
o-o
would always be from
o-o
the correct party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But in general
o-o
elections
o-o
the wrong party
o-o
must not win.
sentence-next
o-o
So there it
o-o
would cause
o-o
trouble,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it seems
o-o
similar to
o-o
everyone
o-o
using the
o-o
clapping tactic.
sentence-next
o-o
Where clapping
o-o
loudly is
o-o
approval.
sentence-next
o-o
And just
o-o
pretending
o-o
to clap
o-o
is disapproval.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly!
o-o
You're understanding
o-o
the concepts
o-o
without getting
o-o
distracted
o-o
by names.
sentence-next
o-o
Bravo!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wouldn't
o-o
just changing
o-o
written
o-o
directions
o-o
on the ballot
o-o
be an easy
o-o
change to make?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I'm not
o-o
politically
o-o
savvy.
sentence-next
o-o
That's outside
o-o
my expertise.
sentence-next
o-o
I just know
o-o
the math behind
o-o
ballot counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On Reddit
o-o
we can upvote
o-o
and downvote.
sentence-next
o-o
That's more
o-o
info.
sentence-next
o-o
Is that
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only if it's
o-o
counted as
o-o
three ranking
o-o
levels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Three?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, an upvote
o-o
is like plus one.
sentence-next
o-o
And a downvote
o-o
is like minus one.
sentence-next
o-o
And neither
o-o
up nor down
o-o
is like zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If counted right
o-o
that could work.
sentence-next
o-o
But using
o-o
five levels
o-o
collects more
o-o
information
o-o
than three.
sentence-next
o-o
And when there are
o-o
lots and lots of candidates
o-o
then up to about twelve
o-o
levels would work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But not
o-o
unlucky thirteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet just
o-o
collecting
o-o
more information
o-o
isn't enough.
sentence-next
o-o
How the information
o-o
is counted to
o-o
identify a
o-o
winner is so
o-o
important to
o-o
get right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the five star
o-o
method won't work?
sentence-next
o-o
Because of
o-o
the clapping
o-o
tactic?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I should
o-o
clarify.
sentence-next
o-o
There are
o-o
two parts
o-o
to any
o-o
voting method.
sentence-next
o-o
There's the ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's the
o-o
counting of those
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What kind'a ballot
o-o
do we use
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Most simple
o-o
elections
o-o
in most nations
o-o
use what's
o-o
increasingly
o-o
called the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'Cause we can
o-o
only mark a
o-o
single choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
sentence-next
o-o
And in a
o-o
simple election
o-o
there's just
o-o
one way
o-o
to count
o-o
that kind
o-o
of ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
Which is why
o-o
until recently
o-o
that ballot didn't
o-o
have a name.
sentence-next
o-o
The counting method
o-o
has different names.
sentence-next
o-o
It's the enemy
o-o
of fair voting
o-o
so it's worth
o-o
learning its names.
sentence-next
o-o
In the academic
o-o
world it's called
o-o
begin-italics plurality voting end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
In Canada
o-o
and other
o-o
British places
o-o
it's called
o-o
begin-italics first past the post end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it called
o-o
here in the states?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's just called
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah!
sentence-next
o-o
With no name
o-o
it becomes harder
o-o
to fight against!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that's the
o-o
enemy?
sentence-next
o-o
Plurality?
sentence-next
o-o
And it uses
o-o
the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Using those for
o-o
democracy
o-o
is like
o-o
using a stick
o-o
attached to
o-o
a round piece of
o-o
cardboard
o-o
as an
o-o
umbrella.
sentence-next
o-o
It works
o-o
for a bit,
o-o
until it
o-o
doesn't.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's the name
o-o
of a ballot where
o-o
each candidate
o-o
can be ranked at
o-o
a different level,
o-o
like on Amazon?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Academically
o-o
that's called a
o-o
ranked choice ballot,
o-o
or a score ballot,
o-o
depending on
o-o
how it's counted.
end-lyric
