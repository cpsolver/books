Consider the same
o-o
kind of ballot
o-o
we use now, the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
But change the
o-o
instructions.
sentence-next
o-o
Allow the voter
o-o
to mark more than
o-o
just one
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
That's called
o-o
approval
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, because you
o-o
either approve
o-o
each candidate or
o-o
leave their name
o-o
unmarked.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This sounds like
o-o
Facebook.
sentence-next
o-o
Where people
o-o
upvote
o-o
entertaining
o-o
kitten videos
o-o
and awesome
o-o
dance moves.
sentence-next
o-o
And fail to
o-o
upvote the
o-o
real naked truth.
sentence-next
o-o
Well,
o-o
the real truth.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're getting this!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On Reddit
o-o
we can upvote
o-o
and downvote.
sentence-next
o-o
That's more
o-o
info.
sentence-next
o-o
Is that
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only if it's
o-o
counted as
o-o
three ranking
o-o
levels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Three?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, an upvote
o-o
is like plus one.
sentence-next
o-o
And a downvote
o-o
is like minus one.
sentence-next
o-o
And neither
o-o
up nor down
o-o
is like zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If counted right
o-o
that could work.
sentence-next
o-o
But using
o-o
five levels
o-o
collects more
o-o
information
o-o
than three.
sentence-next
o-o
And when there are
o-o
lots and lots of candidates
o-o
then up to about twelve
o-o
levels would work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But not
o-o
unlucky thirteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since you
o-o
brought it up,
o-o
I'm guessing,
o-o
approval voting
o-o
might be fair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's useful as
o-o
a simple way
o-o
for friends
o-o
to choose
o-o
a movie.
sentence-next
o-o
And it would work
o-o
OK in
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
elections
o-o
because the winner
o-o
would always be from
o-o
the correct party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But in general
o-o
elections
o-o
the wrong party
o-o
must not win.
sentence-next
o-o
So there it
o-o
would cause
o-o
trouble,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it seems
o-o
similar to
o-o
everyone
o-o
using the
o-o
clapping tactic.
sentence-next
o-o
Where clapping
o-o
loudly is
o-o
approval.
sentence-next
o-o
And just
o-o
pretending
o-o
to clap
o-o
is disapproval.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly!
o-o
You're understanding
o-o
the concepts
o-o
without getting
o-o
distracted
o-o
by names.
sentence-next
o-o
Bravo!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wouldn't
o-o
just changing
o-o
written
o-o
directions
o-o
on the ballot
o-o
be an easy
o-o
change to make?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I'm not
o-o
politically
o-o
savvy.
sentence-next
o-o
That's outside

my expertise.
sentence-next
o-o
I just know
o-o
the math behind
o-o
ballot counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Earlier
o-o
you said we need
o-o
more than just one
o-o
column of
o-o
ballot ovals.
sentence-next
o-o
If we're gonna
o-o
fight,
o-o
let's get it
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's the best
o-o
way to count
o-o
votes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're finally
o-o
ready to
o-o
learn about 
o-o
ranking.
sentence-next
o-o
It uses
o-o
ranked
o-o
choice
o-o
ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
They look the same
o-o
as score ballots
o-o
with ovals,
o-o
but they're counted
o-o
differently.
sentence-next
o-o
It defeats the tactic
o-o
of just marking
o-o
the highest levels
o-o
and lowest levels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-explain Speaks to himself. end-explain
o-o
That's ranking.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
How can those marks
o-o
be counted
o-o
in a way
o-o
that holds up
o-o
under
o-o
scrutiny?
sentence-next
o-o
Without
o-o
mutiny.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's harder than
o-o
any jigsaw
o-o
puzzle
o-o
I've ever
o-o
seen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Admittedly,
o-o
if I asked this
o-o
on a test
o-o
I might soon
o-o
be under
o-o
arrest
o-o
for cerebral
o-o
torment.
sentence-next
o-o
Without written
o-o
consent.
sentence-next
o-o
But take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Maybe
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
we could start
o-o
by looking at
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
just the top
o-o
part?
sentence-next
o-o
The top hyphen-here most
o-o
candidate
o-o
on each
o-o
ballot?
sentence-next
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Side step the fear
o-o
and persevere.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who gets the
o-o
fewest
o-o
top marks
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
gets
o-o
tossed aside?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Then the ballots
o-o
are modified
o-o
to hide the
o-o
one dismissed.
sentence-next
o-o
Then the process
o-o
repeats.
sentence-next
o-o
Until just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
remains?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That counting
o-o
method has
o-o
several
o-o
different names.
sentence-next
o-o
In the U.S.
o-o
it's called
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting.
sentence-next
o-o
Among friends,
o-o
or when a smartphone
o-o
isn't handy,
o-o
that method
o-o
is dandy.
sentence-next
o-o
It works well
o-o
enough that it's
o-o
been used in real
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact it's used
o-o
in Maine, Alaska,
o-o
and Australia,
o-o
in San Francisco,
o-o
and a few
o-o
other places.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So I didn't
o-o
guess right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This is hard stuff.
sentence-next
o-o
Although
o-o
not as hard
o-o
as using an
o-o
abacus
o-o
to calculate
o-o
the square root
o-o
of your social
o-o
security
o-o
number.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet you deserve
o-o
another
o-o
A plus.
sentence-next
o-o
For the basic
o-o
idea of
o-o
using something
o-o
besides counting
o-o
marks and looking
o-o
for the biggest
o-o
count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Your reactions
o-o
are such a
o-o
contrast
o-o
to what
o-o
in the past
o-o
would have been
o-o
kicks in the
o-o
ass.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet this
o-o
counting method
o-o
isn't flawless.
sentence-next
o-o
Instant
o-o
runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
was used in
o-o
the city of
o-o
Burlington,
o-o
in Vermont,
o-o
and it failed
o-o
in their first
o-o
election for
o-o
mayor.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the smallest
o-o
transferred
o-o
vote count
o-o
isn't always
o-o
the least popular
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
And it made
o-o
a similar mistake
o-o
in one Alaska
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
So when
o-o
eliminating
o-o
candidates
o-o
one by one,
o-o
which candidate
o-o
is always the
o-o
least popular?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm stumpified.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've heard of the
o-o
electoral college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's garbage!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, but one thing
o-o
it gets quite right.
sentence-next
o-o
The winner
o-o
of the
o-o
electoral
o-o
fight
o-o
has to get
o-o
more than half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Here's the fraction.
sentence-next
o-o
A half.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
my fraction fears
o-o
have disappeared.
sentence-next
o-o
For now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
More than half,
o-o
that's called a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If a
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a
o-o
majority,
o-o
then vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
sentence-next
o-o
That's so important
o-o
that Roberts
o-o
Rules of Order
o-o
have always
o-o
insisted
o-o
on getting
o-o
majority
o-o
support
o-o
to declare
o-o
a winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So getting more
o-o
than half the votes
o-o
is a must.
sentence-next
o-o
But how can
o-o
there always
o-o
be a
o-o
majority?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
when there are
o-o
more than two
o-o
candidates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is hard.
sentence-next
o-o
Is it time

for recess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Remember that
o-o
business success

this out.

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In sports,
o-o
how are teams ranked?

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't teams ranked

...
o-o
well,

points.

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
How many teams

compete in each game?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Just two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And what's that called,
o-o
two at a time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Two at a time,
o-o
that's a pair

end-lyric

Pairwise.

o-o
That's the name.

So how would

that work?

ambee sings-damien amenn
Pairwise, ...
sentence-next
o-o
ah, counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,

pairwise counting.

It's a very important
