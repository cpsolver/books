Would you like
o-o
to take a guess
o-o
how to count marks
o-o
in a way
o-o
that holds up
o-o
under
o-o
scrutiny?
sentence-next
o-o
Without
o-o
mutiny.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's harder than
o-o
any jigsaw
o-o
puzzle
o-o
I've ever
o-o
seen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Admittedly,
o-o
if I asked this
o-o
on a test
o-o
I might soon
o-o
be under
o-o
arrest
o-o
for cerebral
o-o
torment.
sentence-next
o-o
Without written
o-o
consent.
sentence-next
o-o
But take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Maybe
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
we could start
o-o
by looking at
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
just the top
o-o
part?
sentence-next
o-o
The top hyphen-here most
o-o
candidate
o-o
on each
o-o
ballot?
sentence-next
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Side step the fear
o-o
and persevere.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who gets the
o-o
fewest
o-o
top marks
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
gets
o-o
tossed aside?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Then the ballots
o-o
are modified
o-o
to hide the
o-o
one dismissed?
sentence-next
o-o
Then the process
o-o
repeats.
sentence-next
o-o
Until there's
o-o
just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
left on
o-o
the list?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
You two deserve
o-o
another
o-o
A plus.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
for thinking of
o-o
something besides
o-o
counting
o-o
marks and looking
o-o
for the biggest
o-o
count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it called?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It has
o-o
several
o-o
different names.
sentence-next
o-o
In the U.S.
o-o
it's called
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting.
sentence-next
o-o
And it's fair.
sentence-next
o-o
Most of the time.
sentence-next
o-o
It's like
o-o
pole vaulting
o-o
over what
o-o
we use now.
sentence-next
o-o
Although using
o-o
a pole that
o-o
isn't yet
o-o
full length.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We're on our way!
sentence-next
o-o
To better
o-o
elections!
sentence-next
o-o
Wonderful!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Among friends,
o-o
or when a
o-o
smartphone
o-o
isn't handy,
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
is dandy.
sentence-next
o-o
It works well
o-o
enough that it's
o-o
used in real
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
It's used
o-o
in Maine, Alaska,
o-o
and Australia,
o-o
in San Francisco,
o-o
and a few
o-o
other places.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So I didn't
o-o
guess right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This is hard stuff.
sentence-next
o-o
Although
o-o
not as hard
o-o
as using an
o-o
abacus
o-o
to calculate
o-o
the square root
o-o
of your social
o-o
security
o-o
number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Your reactions
o-o
are such a
o-o
contrast
o-o
to what
o-o
in the past
o-o
would have been
o-o
kicks in the
o-o
ass.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the flaw?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In hundreds
o-o
of U.S.
o-o
elections
o-o
it's yielded
o-o
the correct
o-o
winner.
sentence-next
o-o
But one time
o-o
in the city of
o-o
Burlington,
o-o
in Vermont,
o-o
it failed
o-o
in their first
o-o
election for
o-o
mayor.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the smallest
o-o
transferred
o-o
vote count
o-o
isn't always
o-o
the least popular
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
And it made
o-o
a similar
o-o
mistake
o-o
one time in
o-o
Alaska.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Two failures
o-o
out of hundreds
o-o
is a good score
o-o
in some games.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That beats
o-o
our currently
o-o
ginormous
o-o
failure rate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet we
o-o
can do better.
sentence-next
o-o
When we
o-o
eliminate
o-o
candidates
o-o
one by one,
o-o
which candidate
o-o
is always the
o-o
least popular?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm stumpified.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've heard of the
o-o
electoral college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's garbage!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, but one thing
o-o
it gets quite right.
sentence-next
o-o
The winner
o-o
of the
o-o
electoral
o-o
fight
o-o
has to get
o-o
more than half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Here's the fraction.
sentence-next
o-o
A half.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
my fraction fears
o-o
have disappeared.
sentence-next
o-o
For now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
More than half,
o-o
that's called a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If a
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a
o-o
majority,
o-o
then vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
sentence-next
o-o
That's so important
o-o
that Roberts
o-o
Rules of Order
o-o
have always
o-o
insisted
o-o
on getting
o-o
majority
o-o
support
o-o
to declare
o-o
a winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So gettin' more
o-o
than half the votes
o-o
is a must.
sentence-next
o-o
But how can
o-o
there always
o-o
be a
o-o
majority?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
when there are
o-o
more than two
o-o
candidates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is hard.
sentence-next
o-o
Is it time
o-o
for recess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Remember that
o-o
business success
o-o
is your reward
o-o
for
o-o
sorting
o-o
this out.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In sports,
o-o
how are teams ranked?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't teams ranked
o-o
based on,
o-o
...
o-o
well,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
I think they get
o-o
points.
sentence-next
o-o
Or maybe lose points,
o-o
from each game.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
How many teams
o-o
compete in each game?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Just two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And what's that called,
o-o
two at a time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Two at a time,
o-o
that's a pair
o-o
at a time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the name.
sentence-next
o-o
So how would
o-o
that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Pairwise, ...
sentence-next
o-o
ah, counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
pairwise counting.
sentence-next
o-o
It's a very important
o-o
thing.
sentence-next
o-o
How would that work?
end-lyric
