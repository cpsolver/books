Here's a
o-o
related
o-o
perspective.
sentence-next
o-o
Does your wife
o-o
boast?
sentence-next
o-o
Typically
o-o
a criticism
o-o
reveals more
o-o
about the
o-o
accuser
o-o
than the
o-o
accusee.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Mom does brag
o-o
that she has
o-o
an entire closet
o-o
just for her shoes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
She spends

sentence-next
o-o
She thinks
o-o
the money
o-o
I earn
o-o
grows on trees!
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
This is
o-o
interesting.
sentence-next
o-o
She criticizes you
o-o
for something she does.
sentence-next
o-o
And you are
o-o
criticizing
o-o
her for thinking
o-o
money grows
o-o
on trees.
sentence-next
o-o
So,
o-o
according
o-o
to what father
o-o
just said,
o-o
you think that
o-o
money grows
o-o
on trees.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I work hard
o-o
to discover
o-o
which trees
o-o
have fruit
o-o
waiting to be
o-o
harvested.
sentence-next
o-o
And I do
o-o
the hard work
o-o
of doing that
o-o
harvesting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Do you pick
o-o
as much as you can?
sentence-next
o-o
Or do you leave
o-o
some fruit for
o-o
the next
o-o
hungry person
o-o
who comes along?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
My family
o-o
needs as
o-o
much as I
o-o
can harvest.
sentence-next
o-o
Other people
o-o
are too greedy.
sentence-next
o-o
So I have to
o-o
work hard
o-o
to earn my
o-o
family's share.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm not
o-o
one of those
o-o
lazy 
o-o
immigrants,
o-o

o-o
criminal
o-o
protestors,
o-o
or
o-o
sociopathic

who wait for

Quite the reverse.

She threw some trash

end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I have a
o-o
question.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do
o-o
religious
o-o
organizations
o-o
get tax
o-o
exemptions?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
since religion
o-o
seems so, ...
sentence-next
o-o
well, ...
sentence-next
o-o
antiquated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I believe
o-o
you have

on this.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since before the
o-o
Roman empire,
o-o
people who were
o-o
not rich enough
o-o
to hire
o-o
musicians
o-o
gathered in
o-o
churches to hear
o-o
beautiful
o-o
music.
sentence-next
o-o
Now, anyone with
o-o
a bulge in their
o-o
pocket can listen
o-o
to any song at
o-o
any moment.
sentence-next
o-o
So churches lost
o-o
that advantage.
sentence-next
o-o
First to phonographs,
o-o
then to radios,
o-o
and now smartphones.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas, competing sources
o-o
of beautiful
o-o
music partly
o-o
accounts for our
o-o
congregations
o-o
being small.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
people who love
o-o
to sing together
o-o
still gather
o-o
in our
o-o
worship hall.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And long ago marriage
o-o
in a church was
o-o
a way for a young
o-o
woman to trade sex
o-o
in exchange for
o-o
getting her husband
o-o
to attend church
o-o
and hear sermons
o-o
about doing good.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I must admit
o-o
my wife has wanted
o-o
me to attend
o-o
church with her.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Then governments
o-o
copied that idea
o-o
and now marriage
o-o
is done as a
o-o
civil ceremony.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus courts
o-o
and the
o-o
IRS
o-o
force
o-o
child support
o-o
and
o-o
alimony
o-o
payments from men
o-o
who abandon
o-o
their children
o-o
or their wives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes, marriage
o-o
ceremonies.
sentence-next
o-o
That was a big
o-o
monopoly
o-o
churches had,
o-o
then lost.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
And churches
o-o
used to feed
o-o
the hungry.
sentence-next
o-o
Now grocery stores
o-o
give out food
o-o
ingredients
o-o
in exchange
o-o
for payments
o-o
from the government.
sentence-next
o-o
So that's one more
o-o
advantage lost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Universities
o-o
and schools
o-o
were founded
o-o
alongside
o-o
churches and mosques.
sentence-next
o-o
Now,
o-o
governments
o-o
fund those too.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
So government
o-o
is taking over
o-o
increasing
o-o
morality?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Only some of it!
sentence-next
o-o
We still serve a
o-o
very useful service.
sentence-next
o-o
We remind folks
o-o
to act in ways
o-o
that are fair
o-o
and benevolent.
sentence-next
o-o
But religion
o-o
is about much more
o-o
than just ending
o-o
bad behavior.
sentence-next
o-o
That's just
o-o
the beginning
o-o
of the spiritual
o-o
world.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
A few
o-o
badly behaving
o-o
priests in the
o-o
Catholic Church
o-o
need to learn
o-o
from your wisdom.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Alas,
o-o
with low attendance,
o-o
there are fewer funds,
o-o
so churches can't
o-o
be as picky
o-o
about choosing
o-o
ministers.
sentence-next
o-o
And those of us
o-o
with the highest
o-o
ethics don't get
o-o
paid much more than
o-o
beginners.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
And the clergy sinners.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Recently
o-o
I learned
o-o
about a way
o-o
that crime can be
o-o
reduced without
o-o
churches being
o-o
involved.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Good golly
o-o
bonnie lass!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Movies and
o-o
video games
o-o
can get another
o-o
rating.
sentence-next
o-o
The added rating
o-o
would indicate
o-o
how many years
o-o
a person would
o-o
spend in prison
o-o
if they did
o-o
everything
o-o
shown on the

is law and order!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes we need
o-o
law and order.
sentence-next
o-o
But not the kind
o-o
based on the
o-o
TV shows
o-o
with that name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Those are based
o-o
on real police
o-o
cases.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes,
o-o
but races are changed
o-o
to protect

white supremacy.
sentence-next
o-o
Those shows

don't show

sentence-next
o-o
And the white

sentence-next
