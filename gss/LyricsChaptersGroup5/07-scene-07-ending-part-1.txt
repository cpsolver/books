begin-comment Illustration:
Hospital recovery room, with single hospital bed, and one chair to right and behind bed.
Venture capitalist is lying in hospital bed, hooked up to monitor showing heartbeat.
Religious minister is sitting on chair, and is holding (closed) Bible.
Father of fiance is standing on right side.
In foreground are, from left to right, Desha, Damien, fiance.
Religious minister is Desha's (biological) father, so much match Desha's general racial/genetic characteristics, and he is wearing a priest's collar and Christian priest's black clothes.
Father of fiance much match fiance's general racial/genetic characteristics, and he is a nicely dressed businessman with coat and tie.
Everyone is facing Damien, and Damien is mostly facing viewer, but his head and partially his body is facing toward right side (toward fiance), as would happen in a performance on a theatre stage.

Your actions,

This heart attack

o-o
I don't feel

end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To cast out fear,

fill your heart with love.

o-o
That's what your heart

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I have no kids
o-o
and no real friends.
sentence-next
o-o
I do love Benjamins,
o-o
but that's where it ends.
sentence-next
o-o
My money brings pleasure,

trustworthy

o-o
Who can I love?

How does that feel?

o-o
Is there time to love?

o-o
Can it really heal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To love, first you must

let go of darkness.
sentence-next
o-o
Start with understanding
o-o
that money is not evil.
sentence-next
o-o
It's greed that is evil.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Is it greedy to want

to have it all?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
We are human,
o-o
so all of us
o-o
want it all.
sentence-next
o-o
But there's not enough
o-o
time or energy to
o-o
acquire it all.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
But there are
o-o
shortcuts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Most shortcuts
o-o
increase
o-o
suffering
o-o
for others.
sentence-next
o-o
That blocks you
o-o
from rising
o-o
spiritually,
o-o
and reaching
o-o
the highest
o-o
kinds of love,
o-o
far above
o-o
criminals
o-o
and lawyers,
o-o
...
o-o
I mean
o-o
sinners.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why the
o-o
Bible declares
o-o
a camel
o-o
can squeeze through
o-o
the eye of a
o-o
needle
o-o
easier than
o-o
a rich man
o-o
can become
o-o
a loving saint
o-o
on earth.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I do want
o-o
to be loved.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I'm not yet
o-o
tired of
o-o
being
o-o
admired.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Which has
o-o
a higher
o-o
priority?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's all
o-o
important.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
For something to be
o-o
important,
o-o
everything else
o-o
must be less
o-o
important.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's now
o-o
important
o-o
that I live.
sentence-next
o-o
I now believe
o-o
religion can
o-o
give me more than
o-o
what I had
o-o
before my
o-o
heart attack.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Do you embrace
o-o
religion to
o-o
do good deeds?
sentence-next
o-o
Or just to feel
o-o
less guilt for
o-o
doing what
o-o
God would
o-o
frown on?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I'm a bit lost.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm in a fog.
sentence-next
o-o
Don't I need to
o-o
engage in
o-o
combat
o-o
against the
o-o
wicked evil
o-o
hiding in
o-o
other
o-o
people?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Wickedness
o-o
is not always
o-o
hiding in us.
sentence-next
o-o
If you're thinking
o-o
of horror flicks,
o-o
super hyphen-here hero
o-o
comic books,
o-o
and murderous
o-o
Voldemort,
o-o
that's all
o-o
fiction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What about
o-o
the news?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
News sources
o-o
sell your
o-o
eyeballs and
o-o
ears to
o-o
advertisers,
o-o
so they choose
o-o
dramatic news
o-o
and sound bites
o-o
that excite
o-o
your fears,
o-o
your anger,
o-o
your desires,
o-o
and your
o-o
laughter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah yes,
o-o
assault weapons
o-o
in the hands
o-o
of blind
o-o
pacifists
o-o
would never
o-o
qualify
o-o
as newsworthy.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I still
o-o
vividly
o-o
remember
o-o
as a child
o-o
hearing priests
o-o
yelling in anger
o-o
against
o-o
the devil
o-o
to stop tempting
o-o
us mortal souls.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Drama and fear
o-o
attracts
o-o
bigger
o-o
congregations
o-o
and bigger
o-o
donations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What about the
o-o
Holocaust?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
During a time of
o-o
nationwide
o-o
starvation,
o-o
and massive
o-o
economic
o-o
suffering,
o-o
plus mass
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
the Nazi
o-o
government
o-o
encouraged
o-o
non hyphen-here Jewish
o-o
Germans
o-o
to steal gold
o-o
and cash and
o-o
houses and
o-o
businesses
o-o
and dignity
o-o
from Jews.
sentence-next
o-o
Ironically
o-o
part of the
o-o
reason Jews
o-o
had become
o-o
wealthy is that
o-o
early Christians
o-o
were taught
o-o
they should not
o-o
charge interest
o-o
when lending
o-o
money.
sentence-next
o-o
So early
o-o
Christians
o-o
recruited Jews
o-o
living in
o-o
ghettos
o-o
to do the
o-o
lending.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That explains
o-o
why Jews
o-o
aren't a small
o-o
minority
o-o
in the banking
o-o
industry
o-o
and in
o-o
New York City.
sentence-next
o-o
But surely
o-o
there's no excuse
o-o
for the evil
o-o
in dictators,
o-o
terrorists,
o-o
and mass
o-o
murderers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Dictators
o-o
are addicted
o-o
to ego boosts,
o-o
so they fight
o-o
to protect
o-o
having a harem
o-o
and sailing aboard
o-o
an ego hyphen-here inflated
o-o
yacht.
sentence-next
o-o
Terrorists
o-o
and soldiers
o-o
mostly fight
o-o
to protect
o-o
their friends,
o-o
family,
o-o
culture,
o-o
money,
o-o
and sexuality.
sentence-next
o-o
Alas,
o-o
a few people
o-o
do cling
o-o
to the disease
o-o
of evil
o-o
long after
o-o
getting
o-o
infected.
sentence-next
o-o
That infection
o-o
comes from
o-o
an immature
o-o
human who
o-o
also still clings
o-o
to the disease.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately,
o-o
eventually,
o-o
in a real
o-o
democracy
o-o
that evil
o-o
dies out.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
all of us
o-o
begin our time
o-o
in the womb
o-o
feeling
o-o
unconditional
o-o
joy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Is there an
o-o
antidote?
sentence-next
o-o
To evil?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes,
o-o
talking.
sentence-next
o-o
To people on
o-o
the other side.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Talking.
sentence-next
o-o
I do lots
o-o
of that,
o-o
as part of
o-o
business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Do you ask
o-o
questions
o-o
with a desire
o-o
to understand
o-o
the other person's
o-o
point of view?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Why would I
o-o
do that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Consider what
o-o
ended apartheid
o-o
in South
o-o
Africa.
sentence-next
o-o
It was secret
o-o
talks.
sentence-next
o-o
One of them
o-o
was between
o-o
Nelson Mandela,
o-o
and a
o-o
clergyman,
o-o
and the
o-o
clergyman's
o-o
twin brother
o-o
who led a
o-o
militant
o-o
group that
o-o
supported
o-o
apartheid.
sentence-next
o-o
Through talking,
o-o
Mandela
o-o
and the
o-o
pro hyphen-here apartheid
o-o
leader
o-o
discovered
o-o
unexpected
o-o
common ground.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Does this work in
o-o
relationships?
sentence-next
o-o
I admit
o-o
I could use
o-o
some of those
o-o
kinds of tips.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
But don't expect
o-o
you'll ever
o-o
fully find out
o-o
what's in the
o-o
other person's
o-o
mind.
sentence-next
o-o
Your goal should be
o-o
to seek a path
o-o
that benefits
o-o
both sides.
sentence-next
o-o
Talking helps
o-o
you find that
o-o
path.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Even when
o-o
women
o-o
seem to assume
o-o
every male is
o-o
a sexual wolf
o-o
unless he's gay?
sentence-next
o-o
Where do they get
o-o
those ideas?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
It's like you
o-o
having assumed
o-o
that evil
o-o
is hiding
o-o
in most people.
sentence-next
o-o
Talking involes
o-o
meanings that
o-o
are sloppy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Like when someone
o-o
says begin-italics next Friday end-italics
o-o
on a Wednesday?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes,
o-o
ambiguity,
o-o
multiple
o-o
meanings,
o-o
make it easy
o-o
to assume
o-o
the words mean what
o-o
we expect,
o-o
instead of
o-o
what the speaker
o-o
intends.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why talking
o-o
should be
o-o
two hyphen-here sided,
o-o
with a desire
o-o
to understand
o-o
the other person's
o-o
fantasy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
My head is
o-o
spinning.
sentence-next
o-o
Without money
o-o
as a compass
o-o
I'm lost.
sentence-next
o-o
And winning.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the only
o-o
goal I know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Ah, yes,
o-o
winning.
sentence-next
o-o
Parents,
o-o
teachers,
o-o
employers,
o-o
the wine industry,
o-o
and Broadway
o-o
all use the
o-o
winning of
o-o
prizes
o-o
to entice
o-o
kids,
o-o
employees,
o-o
creative
o-o
artists,
o-o
and
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
to learn skills,
o-o
obey their
o-o
alarm clock,
o-o
and attract
o-o
customers
o-o
to high hyphen-here cost
o-o
luxuries.
sentence-next
o-o
But with
o-o
maturity
o-o
we leave behind
o-o
the gold stars,
o-o
the shiny
o-o
trophies,
o-o
the memory
o-o
of being
o-o
employee
o-o
of the month,
o-o
and even the
o-o
dreams of fans
o-o
drunkenly
o-o
chanting your
o-o
brand's name.
sentence-next
o-o
The real prizes
o-o
are learning
o-o
and doing
o-o
and benefitting
o-o
others.
sentence-next
o-o
Now the skill
o-o
you seek is
o-o
spirituality.
sentence-next
o-o
It's trophy
o-o
is joy.
sentence-next
o-o
But it's not a
o-o
competition.
sentence-next
o-o
Ripping joy
o-o
from someone
o-o
doesn't give you
o-o
more of it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You're ripping
o-o
away what's

familiar.
sentence-next
o-o
Can you give me

sentence-next
o-o
Something that points

But if instead

you live your life

as if
o-o
two plus two

you'll live in

harmony

who share

that same

perspective.

That's how God

Why have I not

your pulpit
o-o
in church?
end-lyric

There are some things

we can't preach.

What else
o-o
can you not say

aloud?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Speaking out
o-o
against warfare,
o-o
such as saying
o-o
it's worse than
o-o
abortion,
o-o
would impair
o-o
our tax hyphen-here exempt

status.

That's right!

Churches don't pay

church?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Many ministers
o-o
manipulate
o-o
their flock by
o-o
transforming
o-o
guilt into shame.
sentence-next
o-o
But the best
o-o
ministers
o-o
transform guilt
o-o
into choosing
o-o
actions that
o-o
don't lead to
o-o
new guilt.
sentence-next
o-o
But attendance
o-o
would suffer

level.

Father, why

in church do you

not talk more about

so much to the

names and words
o-o
in the Bible.

question.

My wife

tells me
o-o
my boasting

would make

a peacock

blush.
sentence-next
o-o
She says
o-o
I should be
o-o
more humble
o-o
like Jesus,
o-o
who was just
o-o
a lowly
o-o
carpenter.
sentence-next
o-o
What can I

say to her
o-o
to make her
o-o
understand
o-o
that pride
o-o
naturally
o-o
follows
o-o
from doing
o-o
great things?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To set
o-o
the record
o-o
straight,
o-o
Jesus
o-o
probably
o-o
was not a
o-o
lowly
o-o
carpenter.
sentence-next
o-o
He grew up in
o-o
Nazareth,
o-o
where there are

no trees.

Jesus Christ!

carpenter.

The original
o-o
word in

ancient Greek

also could have

referred to
o-o
a blacksmith,

a ship builder,
o-o
or a stone mason.
sentence-next
o-o
Stone mason
o-o
makes the most

sense to me.
sentence-next
o-o
A crew of
o-o
thirteen
o-o
stone masons,
o-o
plus the
o-o
women who
o-o
did their cooking
o-o
and laundry,
o-o
would have been
o-o
welcomed,
o-o
and well paid,

for constructing

stone buildings.

Boasting
o-o
is a sign of
o-o
low self esteem.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet the real kind
o-o
of self love is
o-o
essential.
o-o
That's because
o-o
you can't love
o-o
someone else
o-o
more than you love
o-o
yourself.
sentence-next
o-o
That kind of
o-o
self love
o-o
you build
o-o
inside,
o-o
not as a

displayed
o-o
kind of pride.

I'm loved
