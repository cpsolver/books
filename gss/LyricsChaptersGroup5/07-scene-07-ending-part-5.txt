sentence-next
o-o
But how nice of

a lifestyle
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Just a cute
o-o
three hyphen-here bedroom
o-o
house with a
o-o
fireplace.
sentence-next
o-o
And of course
o-o
a big backyard
o-o
for a dog.
sentence-next
o-o
But it can be
o-o
smaller than a

Saint Bernard.
sentence-next
o-o
And a
o-o
comfortable car
o-o
for road trips
o-o
and errands.
sentence-next
o-o
And sometimes a
o-o
trip to London
o-o
or Paris.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought our plan
o-o
was to enjoy time
o-o
at home eating
o-o
healthy food, and
o-o
relaxing on
o-o
the weekend,
o-o
plus spending
o-o
time with friends.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Of course all of that too.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
And of course
o-o
your mother and I

want grandchildren.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If the worlds of
o-o
politics,
o-o
and business,
o-o
and the economy,
o-o
were not so
o-o
upside down,
o-o
then all of that,
o-o
plus a tiara,
o-o
would be within

our reach.
sentence-next
o-o
But now we're living
o-o
during a time
o-o
of transition.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm afraid
o-o
we could enter
o-o
a new dark age
o-o
if we stay on
o-o
the path we're on.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead I want
o-o
to help make
o-o
the world a
o-o
better place
o-o
for everyone's
o-o
grandkids,
o-o
even if that means
o-o
I, or we,

have to make
o-o
a few
o-o
sacrifices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn

You are my precious

princess so I'll
o-o
continue to give
o-o
you money if
o-o
that's what it takes
o-o
to keep you happy.
sentence-next
o-o
I'll even help
o-o
support the two of you
o-o
financially
o-o
if that's necessary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
This puts me in
o-o
an awkward place.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The fact that you
o-o
have to think about
o-o
which to choose
o-o
tells me that it's
o-o
me who should lose.
sentence-next
o-o
And your father's
o-o
offer of
o-o
financial
o-o
support
o-o
basically is
o-o
bribery
o-o
to cover up
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's easy
o-o
to find a guy
o-o
who earns
o-o
good money
o-o
stepping on
o-o
people's toes.
sentence-next
o-o
But if he's young
o-o
he'll pick you up
o-o
in a pickup truck
o-o
double parked,
o-o
engine revving,
o-o
and honking
o-o
his horn.
sentence-next
o-o
Young mature men

sentence-next
o-o
So do you want
o-o
money or maturity?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
I want both.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

I'll clear out my
o-o
things in a few days.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn

end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Skank.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the word

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Father taught me
o-o
long ago that when
o-o
someone criticizes
o-o
another it's
o-o
as if they're
o-o
pointing into
o-o
a mirror.
sentence-next
o-o
So the critic's
o-o
the one who
o-o
deserves their own
o-o
criticism.
end-lyric

prom night.
sentence-next
o-o
And I'll add that
o-o
you two, name-damien

o-o
seem like wonderful
o-o
young people to me.
sentence-next
o-o
And I've learned that
o-o
I could use a
o-o
few new friends.
sentence-next
o-o
So if either
o-o
or both of you
o-o
want to come and

visit me at home
o-o
after I'm out

o-o
you're invited.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm beginning

o-o
But I've been told
o-o
I'm a bad hyphen-here ass,
o-o
and that's not going

to change.
sentence-next
o-o
So unless you like
o-o
being criticized
o-o
for your money quest,
o-o
staying away
o-o
might be best.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
As for me,
o-o
probably I

Or handsome.
sentence-next
o-o
As you know I've

got no money I

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The reason Willie
