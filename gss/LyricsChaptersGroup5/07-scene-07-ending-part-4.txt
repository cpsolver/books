when there are more

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A taker
o-o
business is the

sinning kind,

and a maker

the saintly kind.
end-lyric

Why would my

more maker

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Maker businesses,
o-o
not only bring
o-o
money into
o-o
a city or state,
o-o
they pass that
o-o
money to
o-o
their employees.
sentence-next
o-o
Those employees
o-o
are customers
o-o
of other

businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
Those businesses
o-o
then pass along

that money
o-o
to yet other

o-o
that probably
o-o
employ
o-o
some of your
o-o
customers,
o-o
the people who
o-o
buy houses
o-o
and condos.
sentence-next
o-o
If there were no
o-o
maker businesses,
o-o
no money would
o-o
enter the state
o-o

o-o
and the local

economy
o-o
would collapse.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
o-o
It's like
o-o
trickle down
o-o
economics.
sentence-next
o-o
But instead of
o-o
telling folks
o-o
our money will
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to them,
o-o
the money
o-o
flowing into
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
really does
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to us
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I see
o-o
the employees
o-o
of one business
o-o
are the customers
o-o
of other
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And it affects
o-o
homelessness
o-o
and crime.
sentence-next
o-o
Even if an
o-o
employee of
o-o
a maker
o-o
business
o-o
doesn't buy
o-o
one of your
o-o
high hyphen-here priced condos,
o-o
they might rent
o-o
an apartment
o-o
that forces
o-o
a lower hyphen-here paid
o-o
employee
o-o
to rent a
o-o
tiny studio
o-o
apartment,
o-o
which in turn,
o-o
can force
o-o
a yet lower hyphen-here paid
o-o
employee into
o-o
homelessness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And homeless
o-o
people often
o-o
numb the pain
o-o
of their
o-o
suffering
o-o
with drug abuse.
sentence-next
o-o
That can lead to
o-o
stealing
o-o
from stores,
o-o
which hurts
o-o
the owners
o-o
of those
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if you want
o-o
less crime,
o-o
now is the time
o-o
to prevent it
o-o
by caring
o-o
about how many
o-o
maker businesses
o-o
are bringing

money into
o-o
the local

end-lyric

like McDonalds,

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yet another

exploited.

Finally
o-o
we agree
o-o
on something.

deserve to

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it wouldn't
o-o

attention
o-o
if business
o-o
owners reduced

the wage gap.

with the
o-o
worlds of business
o-o

o-o
recently
o-o
declining
o-o
in ethics,
o-o
we the voters
o-o
need to fight
o-o
for fairness!
sentence-next

That fairness
o-o
means less
o-o
corruption.

o-o
And wiser

o-o
the wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
tax credit,
o-o
and the tax break
o-o
for small maker

businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
The reduced
o-o
corruption,
o-o
and the increased

efficiency
o-o
in the economy,
o-o
will bring us
o-o
widespread
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.

prosperity

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to build
o-o
a business that

customers.
sentence-next
o-o
My original
o-o
plan was to
o-o
manufacture
o-o
my leaf gutter
o-o
cleaning tool
o-o
so that fewer

people fall off
o-o
ladders
o-o
when cleaning their

gutters.

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As a
o-o
bachelor,
o-o
a kitchen
o-o
food prep machine
o-o
sounds like
o-o
maybe a good
o-o
alternative
o-o
to getting
o-o
so much takeout
o-o
delivered.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I admit
o-o
a food prep
o-o
appliance
o-o
would reduce
o-o
labor costs
o-o
for my favorite
o-o
restaurants,
o-o
so maybe
o-o
that would make
o-o
dining out
o-o
cost less.
