Yes, there are some

The higher price

sentence-next
o-o
The people

o-o
But all of us

Each price squeeze,

Businesses

This new tax break

They don't have

o-o
Yet they too

sentence-next
o-o
And there are
o-o
many

thousands

You said non hyphen-here chain

Why not chain

restaurants?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They send lots

the city and

ambee sings-desha amenn

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That brings

Without giving

drain the

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Exactly!

So it taxes the sinners

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a useful

end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I like it!

Even though

o-o
Anyway,
o-o
the

like the

difference

between a

word-resume

o-o
A word-resume

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Interesting
o-o
distinction!
sentence-next

What I've accomplished

But now it's time

might be said

in my eulogy.
end-lyric

I don't see the

difference.

o-o
But then religion

isn't my thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Clearly money
o-o
is your thing.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet your
o-o
begin-italics taker end-italics
o-o

o-o
will earn
o-o
more money
o-o
when there are more
o-o
begin-italics maker end-italics
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A taker
o-o
business is the
o-o
sinning kind,
o-o
and a maker
o-o
business is
o-o
the saintly kind.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Why would my
o-o
so hyphen-here called taker
o-o
business
o-o
benefit from
o-o
more maker

businesses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Maker businesses
o-o
not only bring
o-o
money into
o-o
a city or state,
o-o
they also pass
o-o
that money to
o-o
their employees.
sentence-next
o-o
Those employees
o-o
are customers
o-o
of other
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
Some of that wealth
o-o
gets to customers

who buy or rent
o-o
from your business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Imagine

an economic

apocalypse.
sentence-next
o-o
If there were no

maker businesses

in our state,
o-o
no money would

enter our state,
o-o
and our state's
o-o
economy
o-o
would collapse.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
o-o
It's like
o-o
trickle down
o-o
economics.
sentence-next
o-o
But instead of
o-o
telling folks
o-o
our money will
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to them,
o-o
the money
o-o
flowing into
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
really does
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to us
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
I had failed
o-o
to trace the flow
o-o
of money back
o-o
to the maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
that first bring
o-o
money into
o-o
the region's
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And it affects
o-o
homelessness.
sentence-next
o-o
If less money
o-o
enters the state
o-o
through maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
high hyphen-here priced condos
o-o
become
o-o
unaffordable,
o-o
everyone
o-o
eventually
o-o
moves to
o-o
smaller houses
o-o
and smaller
o-o
apartments,
o-o
and a low hyphen-here wage
o-o
employee
o-o
in a tiny
o-o
studio
o-o
apartment
o-o
gets forced into
o-o
homelessness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it affects
o-o
drug abuse
o-o
and crime.
sentence-next
o-o
Homeless
o-o
people often
o-o
numb the pain
o-o
of their
o-o
suffering
o-o
with drug abuse.
sentence-next
o-o
That can lead to
o-o
stealing
o-o
from stores,
o-o
which hurts
o-o
the owners
o-o
of those
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if you want
o-o
less crime,
o-o
less drug abuse,
o-o
and less
o-o
homelessness,
o-o
now is the time
o-o
to prevent it.
sentence-next

By caring

about not just
o-o
big maker

businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
Small maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
all together,
o-o
attract huge

the local

economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yet currently,
o-o
small maker

o-o
pay the same

tax rate as
o-o
law firms,
o-o
insurance
o-o
agencies,
o-o
and franchise
o-o
places.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another
o-o
benefit of
o-o
taxing takers
o-o
more than makers
o-o
is that very smart
o-o
well hyphen-here educated
o-o
people would be less

attracted to

higher paid,

Then a few western
