The people

Each price squeeze,

end-lyric

That brings

increases

costs to those of us

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And it pushes up

end-lyric

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They get lower taxes?

Why?

Because they

You said non hyphen-here chain

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They send lots

Anyway,
o-o
the

A word-resume

A taker

the saintly kind.

more maker

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Maker businesses
o-o
not only bring

money into
o-o
a city or state,
o-o
they also pass
o-o
that money to
o-o
their employees.
sentence-next
o-o
Those employees

Some of that wealth

If there were no

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ah,

It's like

trickle down

sentence-next

But instead of

telling folks
o-o
our money will
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to them,
o-o
the money
o-o
flowing into
o-o
maker

o-o
really does
o-o
trickle down
o-o
to us
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
I had failed

If less money

o-o
high hyphen-here priced condos

unaffordable,
o-o
everyone
o-o
eventually
o-o
moves to
o-o
smaller houses

drug abuse

sentence-next
o-o
Homeless

people often

Don't get any
o-o
socialistic
o-o
notions about
o-o
telling me

to pay my

employees more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not that I care
o-o
about income
o-o
for your business,
o-o
but a wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
tax credit
o-o
might reduce
o-o
the taxes
o-o
your business
o-o
pays.
sentence-next
o-o
And you might get
o-o
sued less
o-o
if you cared more.

Hmm,
o-o
this seems
o-o
to relate to
o-o
what you said
o-o
earlier
o-o
father,
o-o
I mean name-minister no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
You said shortcuts

more money

Churches now
o-o
provide hot meals
o-o
and clothing
o-o
to those who
o-o
cannot afford
o-o
the basics.
sentence-next
o-o
When they can get
o-o
better hyphen-here paying jobs
o-o
we won't need to
o-o
offer as much
o-o
assistance
o-o
to the needy.
sentence-next
o-o
So this is yet
o-o
another way
o-o
churches might lose
o-o
even more of
o-o
our influence.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I'm in favor
o-o
of this reform!
sentence-next
o-o
There are
o-o
lots of people
o-o
with jobs
o-o
who deserve
o-o
food and warmth
o-o
without assistance
o-o
from churches
o-o
or government.

Plus,
o-o
more of the money
o-o
will go into
o-o
the local
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember
o-o
women tend
o-o
to choose jobs
o-o
where they can help
o-o
children,
o-o
nurse folks
o-o
to better health,
o-o
help
o-o
customers,
o-o
and
o-o
sell toy
o-o
dinosaurs.
sentence-next
o-o
Currently
o-o
those jobs pay less.
sentence-next
o-o
When those women
o-o
earn more,
o-o
they will spend
o-o
more of it
o-o
doing good things
o-o
for their family
o-o
and the
o-o
community.
sentence-next
That's way better
o-o
than managers
o-o
and executives
o-o
buying bigger 
o-o
fishing boats,
o-o
paying for
o-o
hunting trips,
o-o
and buying
o-o
stupid lingerie
o-o
as if that
o-o
compensates
o-o
for their failure
o-o
to understand
o-o
what wives want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And there will be
o-o
fewer strikes
o-o
by workers.
sentence-next
o-o
And fewer voters
o-o
pushing for,
o-o
what's that called,
o-o
something like
o-o
guaranteed income?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Universal basic income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Finally
o-o
we agree
o-o
on something.
sentence-next
o-o
That idea doesn't
o-o
deserve to
o-o
exist.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it wouldn't
o-o
be getting
o-o
attention
o-o
if business
o-o
owners reduced
o-o
the wage gap.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember
o-o
capitalism
o-o
is about supply
o-o
and demand.
sentence-next
o-o
When you supply
o-o
better hyphen-here paying jobs
o-o
there will be lots
o-o
of demand
o-o
for those jobs
o-o
so you'll get
o-o
better hyphen-here qualified
o-o
applicants.
sentence-next
o-o
In other words
o-o
those tax credits
o-o
incentivize
o-o
what the

compassion.

This is why,
o-o
with the
o-o
worlds of business
o-o
and government
o-o
recently
o-o
declining
o-o
in ethics,
o-o
we the voters
o-o
need to fight
o-o
for fairness!
sentence-next
o-o
That fairness
o-o
means less
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And wiser
o-o
elected politicians
o-o
will give us
o-o
the wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
tax credit,
o-o
and the tax break
o-o
for small maker
o-o
businesses.
sentence-next
o-o
The reduced
o-o
corruption,
o-o
and the increased
o-o
efficiency
o-o
in the economy,
o-o
will bring us
o-o
widespread
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
So is fairness
o-o
or economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
more important
o-o
to you?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why can't we
o-o
get both?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Getting to the
o-o
point, do you want
o-o
to earn more money
o-o
so we can afford
o-o
maybe a few

luxuries in life?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to build
o-o
a business that
o-o
provides something
o-o
that benefits the

customers.
sentence-next
o-o
My original
o-o
plan was to
o-o
manufacture
o-o
my leaf gutter
o-o
cleaning tool
o-o
so that fewer
o-o
people fall off
o-o
ladders
o-o
when cleaning their
o-o
gutters.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet lately,
o-o
other inventions
o-o
have been popping
o-o
into my mind.
sentence-next
o-o
Most are for the
o-o
kitchen food prep
o-o
appliance
o-o
someone told us
o-o
about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Your mind is in

the gutter.

None of that

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Mmm, I'm
o-o
beginning
o-o
to see the
o-o
value of
o-o
creating
o-o
that kind of

business
o-o
if it gets
o-o
taxed less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And fewer toes

would get

stepped on.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And fewer fingers
o-o
would get cut
o-o
doing food prep.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As a
o-o
bachelor,
o-o
a kitchen
o-o
food prep machine
o-o
sounds like
o-o
maybe a good
o-o
alternative
o-o
to getting
o-o
so much takeout
o-o
delivered.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I admit
o-o
a food prep
o-o
appliance
o-o
might reduce
o-o
labor costs
o-o
for my favorite
o-o
restaurants.
sentence-next
o-o
That would make
o-o
dining out
o-o
cost less.

is something

if I could.
