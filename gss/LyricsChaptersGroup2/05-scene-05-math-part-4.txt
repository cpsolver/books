From reading
o-o
news about
o-o
Europe those
o-o
governments
o-o
have as much
o-o
corruption
o-o
as us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
they focus on
o-o
the balance of power
o-o
between parties,
o-o
but they allow
o-o
party insiders
o-o
to control which
o-o
politicians
o-o
win the seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's corrupt!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So back here
o-o
in the United States,
o-o
suppose each district
o-o
had two
o-o
representatives
o-o
instead of one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would double
o-o
the size of
o-o
the house of
o-o
representatives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't that
o-o
be avoided
o-o
by making
o-o
each district
o-o
double the size?
sentence-next
o-o
And having half
o-o
as many districts?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Very good!
sentence-next
o-o
And using a fraction
o-o
no less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's like building
o-o
a staircase.
sentence-next
o-o
Half as many steps
o-o
means each step
o-o
is twice as high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're
o-o
stepping up
o-o
to design
o-o
a new Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course the
o-o
most popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
would win
o-o
the first seat.
sentence-next
o-o
In a
o-o
double hyphen-here sized
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So how's the
o-o
second seat filled?
sentence-next
o-o
In a way that's fair.
sentence-next
o-o
For the sheep,
o-o
and goats,
o-o
and pigs?
sentence-next
o-o
Or maybe I should say,
o-o
for women to get
o-o
the representation
o-o
we deserve.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Using simple math,
o-o
a computer can
o-o
calculate which
o-o
voters are 
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
by the first hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since that math
o-o
is simple,
o-o
I don't need to
o-o
hear about it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sweet!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The ballots
o-o
of those
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
voters
o-o
would have their
o-o
influence
o-o
greatly reduced.
sentence-next
o-o
Often all the
o-o
way to zero.
sentence-next
o-o
The remaining
o-o
voters still have
o-o
full influence
o-o
for their ballots.
sentence-next
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
is done again,
o-o
and the most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
wins the
o-o
second seat.
sentence-next
o-o
In this
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm guessing the
o-o
effect would be
o-o
to elect one
o-o
Republican
o-o
and one
o-o
Democrat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Typically yes,
o-o
assuming both
o-o
parties offer
o-o
good candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That means
o-o
there would be
o-o
more than just
o-o
one
o-o
Republican
o-o
'n one
o-o
Democrat
o-o
in the race?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes because
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
sentence-next
o-o
So we need
o-o
to allow
o-o
for the
o-o
possibility
o-o
that one
o-o
of the
o-o
parties
o-o
only offers
o-o
disliked
o-o
candidates,
o-o
while the other
o-o
party offers
o-o
better
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, if, say,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party only
o-o
offered puppet
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Pinoke
o-o
'n Oscar,
o-o
'n the Democratic
o-o
party offered
o-o
anti hyphen-here corruption
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Barack
o-o
'n Hypatia,
o-o
then both winners
o-o
could be Democrats?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This seems like a
o-o
winning
o-o
pole vault
o-o
over our low
o-o
limbo bar,
o-o
where we
o-o
are now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But if every district
o-o
elects one
o-o
Republican and
o-o
one Democrat,
o-o
then Congress
o-o
would be tied.
sentence-next
o-o
That's cockeyed.
sentence-next
o-o
The population
o-o
is not
o-o
evenly
o-o
divided
o-o
between the
o-o
two parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To fix that
o-o
unfair balance,
o-o
we make the
o-o
districts a little
o-o
bigger. And we
o-o
reserve a few
o-o
extra seats,
o-o
which are called
o-o
statewide seats.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we can do
o-o
the party hyphen-here based
o-o
adjustment to
o-o
figure out which
o-o
party deserves to win
o-o
each of those
o-o
statewide seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And party
o-o
insiders
o-o
would choose
o-o
whose butts
o-o
will fill
o-o
those seats?
sentence-next
o-o
That seems
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Lots of
o-o
European
o-o
nations
o-o
do it that way,
o-o
but you're right,
o-o
it's not fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why are those
o-o
voters so
o-o
stupid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people
o-o
in power
o-o
are the ones who
o-o
have to approve
o-o
any change.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
sentence-next
o-o
The members of
o-o
parliament
o-o
only embrace
o-o
a change if it's
o-o
likely to get
o-o
themselves
o-o
re hyphen-here elected.
sentence-next
o-o
Otherwise it
o-o
would be as
o-o
unlikely as
o-o
turkeys voting
o-o
in favor of
o-o
Thanksgiving.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another barrier!
sentence-next
o-o
Political
o-o
turkeys.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Far fairer is
o-o
to look at the
o-o
ballots again
o-o
to identify
o-o
the most popular
o-o
of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
would fill that
o-o
party's
o-o
extra seat.
sentence-next
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each next seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That sounds like
o-o
it would rip
o-o
control away from
o-o
party insiders.
sentence-next
o-o
And empower
o-o
the voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much much

fairer than what
o-o
we've got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With no
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
elections
o-o
would no

limited

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
no more blocking,

in two thousand eight.
sentence-next
o-o
Right?

That's right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha
o-o
you're bright.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's just counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And that's what the
o-o
important parts of

mathematics
o-o
are mostly about,
o-o
counting.
sentence-next

Speaking of which,
o-o
you're likely

to run into
o-o
people who
o-o
criticize
o-o
ranked choice

o-o
they don't
o-o
understand
o-o
an important

counting detail.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What detail?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They will claim
o-o
you can't mark
o-o
two candidates
o-o
at the same rank.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like marking
o-o
both Oscar

and Pinoke
o-o
as a third choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
That's not
o-o
a problem for
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
But in
o-o
Australia
o-o
they've been using

paper ballots
o-o
for ranked choice
o-o
voting
o-o
for many decades,
o-o
long before
o-o
computer
o-o
technology
o-o
and pairwise

vote counting
o-o
were an option.
sentence-next
o-o
Their ballots
o-o
have a box
o-o
next to each
o-o
candidate's
o-o
name,
o-o
and a voter
o-o
writes a number
o-o
in each box.
sentence-next
o-o
Counting those
o-o
by hand
o-o
on election night
o-o
was a lot of work,
o-o
so they created
o-o
a shortcut.
sentence-next
o-o
They called that
o-o
ranking pattern
o-o
an begin-italics overvote end-italics no-space ,
o-o
and when
o-o
the counting
o-o
reached
o-o
an overvote
o-o
they tossed
o-o
that ballot
o-o
onto an
o-o
overvote pile,
o-o
and ignored it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's what I'd
o-o
probably do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
it's not like
o-o
the ballot
o-o
could be ripped
o-o
in half
o-o
to divide it
o-o
between two

candidates
o-o
ranked in

the same choice
o-o
column.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Actually,
o-o
mathematically,
o-o
fractions
o-o
would work.
sentence-next
o-o
But voters don't like
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Imagine
o-o
that!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So if you two

with Oscar
o-o
and Pinoke
o-o
as your third choice,
o-o
and your higher hyphen-here ranked

in the race,

how could you

count those

marks correctly?
sentence-next
o-o
Assuming there's
o-o
an even worse

candidate
o-o
ranked lower.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like Gollum,

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If voting

were done
o-o
in person,

I'd tell name-desha
o-o
to stand in
o-o
Pinoke's line,

while I stand in

Oscar's line.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I'd tell
o-o
name-damien
o-o
to stand in
o-o
Pinoke's line,
o-o
cause I'd rather
o-o
deal with Oscar's

than get pricked
o-o
by Pinoke's
o-o
proboscis.
sentence-next
o-o
Either way,
o-o
mathematically
o-o
that's
o-o
equivalent
o-o
to flipping

off the awful

candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's the right
o-o
concept,
o-o
but the wrong

terminology.
sentence-next
o-o
That counting

method is
o-o
easy to do
o-o
with computer
o-o
counting.
sentence-next
o-o
And it's fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see
o-o
why this could be
o-o
useful.
sentence-next
o-o
When there are
o-o
lots of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from lots
o-o
of parties,
o-o
I'd want to mark
o-o
the most evil
o-o
candidate
o-o
as my last choice.
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
I need to use

the next hyphen-here to hyphen-here last
o-o
choice column
o-o
for all the

candidates
o-o
who are worse

as the

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Great thinking!
o-o
That would handle

sentence-next
Another

o-o
refinement

will be to add

calculating

sentence-next
o-o
Using party

the number of

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the least popular

excluded?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That makes sense to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the biggest
o-o
third parties
o-o
would get

one candidate

That gives small

ambee sings-desha amenn
But you haven't
o-o
explained why
o-o
you're pointing
o-o
out these nine
o-o
colored blocks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Each stack
o-o
represents
o-o
one ballot,
o-o
with the voter's
o-o
favorite
o-o
on top,
o-o
and least hyphen-here favorite
o-o
on bottom.
sentence-next
o-o
With these nine
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
the winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla,
o-o
depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As usual,
o-o
brown always
o-o
loses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, I see
o-o
the counting
o-o
method
o-o
matters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
sentence-next
o-o
And yet,
o-o
almost any
o-o
method is better
o-o
than what we've
o-o
got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So now
o-o
do we know
o-o
all about voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And how math
o-o
can solve the
o-o
conflicts
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's one
o-o
more bit.
sentence-next
o-o
But you can learn
o-o
about it
o-o
later,
o-o
when you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
It will be
o-o
improvements
o-o
in how members
o-o
of Congress,
o-o
or a
o-o
parliament,
o-o
will vote to
o-o
decide which
o-o
bills should pass
o-o
to become
o-o
laws.
sentence-next
o-o
But getting
o-o
that math right
o-o
is too advanced
o-o
for you now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wait.
sentence-next
o-o
What about the
o-o
gerrymander
o-o
problem?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
how do we avoid
o-o
district shapes
o-o
that look like
o-o
balloon animals
o-o
made by a clown?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The statewide seats
o-o
take care of that.
sentence-next
o-o
If a party
o-o
dominates
o-o
any district,
o-o
the oppressed
o-o
parties
o-o
will win more
o-o
statewide
o-o
seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a slick
o-o
trick!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's not a trick.
sentence-next
o-o
It's math,
o-o
which can seem
o-o
magical
o-o
to those who
o-o
don't bother
o-o
to learn it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
So now,
o-o
let's suppose
o-o
that elections
o-o
become fair.
sentence-next
o-o
What will change,
o-o
politically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
especially
o-o
for the
o-o
unfortunate
o-o
poor.
sentence-next
o-o
And us college
o-o
grads who failed
o-o
to get to
o-o
the middle
o-o
class.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The answer to that
o-o
I don't know.
sentence-next
o-o
For that you need
o-o
to ask someone
o-o
who understands both
o-o
economics and
o-o
game theory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Game theory?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
sentence-next
o-o
Voting's a game!
sentence-next
o-o
That makes sense.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's an academic field
o-o
that studies, well,
o-o
it's difficult to
o-o
describe.
sentence-next
o-o
But it includes
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
I do know someone
o-o
with those credentials.
sentence-next
o-o
But he's at a
o-o
university
o-o
that's a three hyphen-here hour
o-o
drive away.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do you think he'd
o-o
give us a peek
o-o
into that
o-o
future?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I can ask him
o-o
by email.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be super!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He studies,
o-o
and teaches about,
o-o
economic history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The history
o-o
of economics?
sentence-next
o-o
That sounds like
o-o
a snooze fest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The history
o-o
of economics
o-o
is indeed boring,
o-o
for most of us.
sentence-next
o-o
But that's
o-o
different from 
o-o
economic
o-o
history,
o-o
which is what
o-o
he teaches.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the study
o-o
of economies
o-o
during earlier
o-o
times.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I hate
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
As much as
o-o
I did
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This professor
o-o
can make
o-o
history fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can that be done?
sentence-next
o-o
'N economics,
o-o
that's more math.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You did great
o-o
understanding
o-o
some history about
o-o
mathematics.
sentence-next
o-o
As for math in
o-o
economics,
o-o
it's just different
o-o
names for money
o-o
categories.
sentence-next
o-o
Like tax, debt,
o-o
interest,
o-o
subsidies,
o-o
and tariffs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Don't forget
o-o
bribes,
o-o
kickbacks,
o-o
payoffs,
o-o
payola,
o-o
and ...
sentence-next
o-o
campaign contributions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And you'll hear
o-o
about
o-o
percentages.
