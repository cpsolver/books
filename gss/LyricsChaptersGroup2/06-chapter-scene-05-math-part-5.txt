One more tip.

o-o
There's something

sentence-next
o-o
It's a misuse of

mathematics.

o-o
Math doesn't lie,

I admit I tend

until I do the

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So, we've
o-o
learned that
o-o
ranked choice ballots

o-o
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
is the key

to less corruption,

o-o
So just remember

the concept of

o-o
And needing more

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Half's a fraction
o-o
I can recall.
sentence-next
o-o
But I don't

understand

why you made a

big deal out of

the digit

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It took our

o-o
To us,

o-o
In a similar way
o-o
folks in the

will marvel that
o-o
it took so long

pairwise counting

for counting votes.
sentence-next
o-o
Zero as a digit

changed the world

sentence-next
o-o
Similarly
o-o
pairwise vote counting

So just like we

That's a wise

I was right.

You begin-italics are end-italics

I've got tenure,

Wikipedia.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only bits of it

are in Wikipedia.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because

they require

academic

references,
o-o
especially
o-o
for
o-o
mathematical
o-o
topics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I suppose
o-o
those references
o-o
don't exist because
o-o
governments
o-o
don't fund such

research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is all seeming

like a giant

conspiracy,

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
one more thing.
sentence-next
o-o
Since pairwise counting

is a few years off,

what can we do

in the next

o-o
to fight against
o-o
vote splitting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Tell your friends,
o-o
including the
o-o
ones online,
o-o
that the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot,
o-o
what we use now,
o-o
is not asking
o-o
begin-italics who is your favorite? end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what's it
o-o
asking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Besides
o-o
which loser
o-o
do you want
o-o
to get stuck
o-o
with?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There is no
o-o
easy way
o-o
to say
o-o
what it's
o-o
asking.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's no way
o-o
to mark a
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot to say
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
And choosing
o-o
not to vote
o-o
does not express
o-o
begin-italics none of the above end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Instead a
o-o
voter needs to
o-o
hold their nose
o-o
and mark a
o-o
candidate
o-o
who has a chance
o-o
of winning.
sentence-next
o-o
Otherwise
o-o
they weaken
o-o
the candidate
o-o
they prefer
o-o
who does have
o-o
a chance of
o-o
winning.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But that means
o-o
never voting
o-o
for a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
No.
sentence-next
o-o
You can vote for
o-o
a third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate
o-o
if the
o-o
candidate
o-o
you most despise
o-o
will easily
o-o
win.
sentence-next
o-o
That means
o-o
none of the
o-o
opposition
o-o
candidates
o-o
has a chance
o-o
of winning,
o-o
so then it
o-o
makes sense
o-o
to mark your
o-o
favorite
o-o
opposition
o-o
candidate,
o-o
which can be
o-o
from a third
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So in the next
o-o
presidential
o-o
election,
o-o
if the incumbent
o-o
will easily
o-o
get re hyphen-here elected,
o-o
I can vote
o-o
for a third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's an
o-o
important
o-o
exception.
sentence-next
o-o
In a
o-o
presidential
o-o
election
o-o
the popular
o-o
vote still
o-o
matters.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact,
o-o
the gap between
o-o
the
o-o
Republican
o-o
and the
o-o
Democrat
o-o
is put under
o-o
a microscope
o-o
to compare
o-o
those counts
o-o
with the
o-o
electoral
o-o
vote count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought
o-o
presidential
o-o
elections
o-o
were the most
o-o
important
o-o
to get right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes and no.
sentence-next
o-o
If Congress
o-o
were filled with
o-o
leaders
o-o
instead of
o-o
puppets
o-o
they would pass laws
o-o
and tax changes
o-o
that are
o-o
well hyphen-here designed.
sentence-next
o-o
And the job of
o-o
President
o-o
would be
o-o
to enforce
o-o
those laws.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see that
o-o
until we get
o-o
better elections
o-o
we're stuck
o-o
with vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In the meantime,
o-o
the way to
o-o
help defeat
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is to vote in
o-o
begin-italics both end-italics
primary
o-o
begin-italics and end-italics
general

o-o
And especially
o-o
primary

o-o
for members

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the best way

Promote the

adoption of
