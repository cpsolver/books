invention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

vote splitting
o-o
is.
end-lyric

Then it sounds quite
o-o
esoteric.

o-o
What's important

is that the world

under an

epidemic

four politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.

Could you explain
o-o
what's in your brain?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Pinoke is a

nickname for
o-o
Pinocchio,
o-o
the puppet

whose nose grows

when he lies.
sentence-next

And Oscar's last

o-o
The turds.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Right.

But then

big hyphen-here money

o-o
arrive.
end-lyric

their money
o-o

how you think

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wealthy business

owners,
o-o
who're the biggest
o-o
campaign donors,
o-o
in private they choose
o-o
which puppet gets
o-o
their dollars.
sentence-next
o-o
If they like
o-o
the look of

o-o
then they propose

to Oscar
o-o
that he take
o-o
a hike
o-o
on the
o-o
Appalachian
o-o
trail.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn

o-o
to make Oscar
o-o
a grouch.
sentence-next
o-o
What if he
o-o
should refuse?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They point out
o-o
he'll lose.
sentence-next
o-o
Without their
o-o
funds.
sentence-next
o-o
Or they bribe him
o-o
with favors,
o-o
if that's what
o-o
it takes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A dumpster full
o-o
of cookies

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Or a lifetime

subscription
o-o

sentence-next
o-o
That'd leave
o-o
Pinoke and
o-o
Hypatia
o-o
and Barack.
sentence-next
o-o
Who'd win that
o-o
three hyphen-here way race?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
would split their votes
o-o
between Barack
o-o
and Hypatia.
sentence-next
o-o
That would make
o-o
it easier for
o-o
Pinoke to reach
o-o
victory.

Hypatia

sentence-next
o-o
Plus photos
o-o
of Pinoke
o-o
would be
o-o
photoshopped
o-o
to make his nose
o-o
look normal size
o-o
to hide his lies.
sentence-next
o-o
That'd tip the
o-o
three hyphen-here way balance
o-o
enough
o-o
to rig the race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A puppet wins.
sentence-next
o-o
That's unfair!
sentence-next
o-o
The winner's
o-o
chosen by
o-o
millionaires.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet,
o-o
more voters prefer
o-o
either Hypatia
o-o
or Barack.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's what I've
o-o
figured out.
sentence-next
o-o
But now I'm stuck.
sentence-next
o-o
I dunno how
o-o
to change elections
o-o
so they don't suck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We can call attention
o-o
to this deception.
sentence-next
o-o
We'll get voters
o-o
to concentrate
o-o
their votes on
o-o
either Barack
o-o
or Hypatia.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Who'd decide
o-o
which candidate
o-o
to boycott?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We the voters
o-o
could get one to
o-o
vacate their spot,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd coax
o-o
the wealthiest
o-o
campaign donors
o-o
to quietly fund
o-o
yet another
o-o
candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
One who also
o-o
promises to
o-o
reduce corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Let's name this one
o-o
Gandhi.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes this
o-o
whack hyphen-here a hyphen-here mole
o-o
tactic's
o-o
difficult to beat.
sentence-next
o-o
It splits the voters
o-o
even more,
o-o
making it
o-o
even harder
o-o
to defeat
o-o
their single puppet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
All that happens
o-o
in each
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
Then in the
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
election
o-o
we have to choose
o-o
between the two
o-o
puppets,
o-o
one from each
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now it makes
o-o
yet more sense
o-o
why we have
o-o
just two main
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
This is quite
o-o
unlike
o-o
what I read in
o-o
poly sci begin-explain pronounced SIGH end-explain
o-o
textbooks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N years ago
o-o
puppet
o-o
politicians
o-o
passed a law
o-o
that gives
o-o
taxpayer funds
o-o
to a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
presidential
o-o
candidate
o-o
who gets more than
o-o
five percent of
o-o
the vote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought that
o-o
was a good thing.
sentence-next
o-o
But so far
o-o
it's been a bribe
o-o
to parties on the
o-o
liberal side.
sentence-next
o-o
While conservative
o-o
parties
o-o
don't take that bait.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The conservative
o-o
candidates
o-o
get their bribes
o-o
earlier,
o-o
before
o-o
election
o-o
season starts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So liberals
o-o
get seduced
o-o
into splitting
o-o
their votes.
sentence-next
o-o
While conservatives
o-o
quietly concentrate
o-o
their votes on just
o-o
one candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You learn fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I have a degree
o-o
in political
o-o
science.
sentence-next
o-o
But they never
o-o
taught us the
o-o
hidden money
o-o
part of this
o-o
tactical
o-o
unfairness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The unfairness
o-o
is well hyphen-here hidden
o-o
behind
o-o
numbers.
sentence-next
o-o
'N math to me
o-o
is scary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What scares me is
o-o
that our planet

is losing
o-o
snow leopards and
o-o
elephants, and
o-o
rhinoceros ...
sentence-next
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that what
o-o
pushed you into
o-o
politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
At the age of
o-o
fourteen, ...
sentence-next
o-o
my mother died.
sentence-next
o-o
And then
o-o
my father lied.

He told me

awhile I'd

sentence-next
o-o
While still young.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Neither can I.
sentence-next
o-o
It's still

surrealistic.
sentence-next

years later
o-o
another
o-o
tragic death
o-o
assaulted me.
sentence-next
o-o
...

My brother

East.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How did ya cope?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I almost lost hope.
sentence-next
o-o
Then I realized
o-o
my mother
o-o
was killed by
o-o
incompetent city
o-o
officials.
sentence-next
o-o
They failed to time
o-o
pedestrian walk
o-o

o-o
walkers a head start.
sentence-next
o-o
Before the green
o-o
light for cars.
sentence-next
o-o
And I realized,
o-o
that basically,
o-o
my brother was
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East defending
o-o
profits for oil
o-o
companies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that why we're
o-o
in this graveyard?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
My mother and brother
o-o
are buried over there.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Buried
o-o
as a pair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With room to spare
o-o
for father
o-o
and me.
sentence-next
o-o
Over time I traced
o-o
the local
o-o
corruption
o-o
to the state level,
o-o
then to DC,
o-o
then to Congress
o-o
where they write
o-o
laws so corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah, corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
I wouldn't know
o-o
how to define it,
o-o
but I sure see
o-o
tons of that

A dog owner

It's an example

target?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I've hit a
o-o
turning point.
sentence-next
o-o
Originally

I thought the

capitalism,

opposite.

between

o-o
just a

distraction

tactic.

o-o
It's like what

Mistreat rabbits?

o-o
the sneaky
o-o
trick.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now that I

know the

From what I

can tell,

campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
and even slimy

politicians

are mostly
o-o
clueless.
sentence-next
o-o
They know that

money huggers
o-o
and egotistic

cannot fight back.
sentence-next
o-o
Not with their wealth,

candidates.

mathematics.
