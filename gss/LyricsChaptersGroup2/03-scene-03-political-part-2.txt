Here's another
o-o
diversion tactic.
sentence-next
o-o
Money from the right
o-o
can fund
o-o
extreme agendas
o-o
on the left.
sentence-next
o-o
Like when the
o-o
LGB category
o-o
got extended
o-o
to include
o-o
queers and

transgenders.
sentence-next
o-o
That scares
o-o
lots of voters

to the right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
many voters
o-o
blindly
o-o
believe
o-o
the enemy
o-o
of their

enemy
o-o
is their
o-o
friend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's a powerful
o-o
political
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's foolish.

o-o
'Cause no one

ambee sings-politician amenn
Here's something else

you should know.
sentence-next
o-o
It's easy
o-o
to hide the
o-o
giving of funds
o-o
to both sides,
o-o
left and right.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact there are
o-o
two brothers in

The other brother

Ain't that sweet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N as hard to follow

sentence-next
o-o
So they don't
o-o
give a damn 'bout
o-o
left or right?
sentence-next
o-o
They just lobby
o-o
for sugar ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Subsidies.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
tax money
o-o
that pays for
o-o
canals in Florida
o-o
so farmers
o-o
can grow
o-o
sugarcane.
sentence-next
o-o
They need that for
o-o
the bigger
o-o
financial gains
o-o
that come from
o-o
converting
o-o
sugarcane into
o-o
sugar.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what's done

by the businesses

That's a sour

deal for us.
sentence-next
o-o
How come this
o-o
isn't more
o-o
obvious?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
On commodity

price lists,
o-o
they used to list
o-o
sugar and
o-o
U.S. sugar
o-o
by those names.
sentence-next
o-o
But now
o-o
the names are
o-o
sugar number

That's a

there's somethin'

fuzzy.
sentence-next
o-o
Don't some

rich folks

party?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Lots of lawyers
o-o
get lots of their
o-o
business from
o-o
Democratic voters,
o-o
so they like
o-o
Democratic
o-o
politicians.
sentence-next
o-o
And then there are

industries that

subdivide into
o-o
left and right.

ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
sentence-next
o-o
I thought I was

very few

rich folks
o-o
outvote us,

the non-rich,
o-o
who

outnumber

them?
sentence-next
o-o
Like ants

end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
There are lots

to control

politics.
sentence-next
o-o
For example,
o-o
do you know what
o-o
delegates are?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sure,
o-o
that's the

laundry cycle
o-o
women use to

o-o
This is delegates
o-o
with a begin-italics Gee end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So I should

ask to try guts
o-o
the next time
o-o
I'm in a

delicatessen?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
A delegate
o-o
is someone
o-o
you vote for
o-o
and they vote for
o-o
the actual candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like the
o-o
electoral college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Sort of
o-o
like that.
sentence-next
o-o
But here
o-o
I'm talking
o-o
about a primary
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
The one before
o-o
the nomination
o-o
convention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The conventions
o-o
I know about
o-o
sell
o-o
computer games,
o-o
comic books,
o-o
and whacky
o-o
kitchen gadgets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
A political
o-o
convention
o-o
doesn't sell
o-o
anything,
o-o
at least not
o-o
directly.
sentence-next
o-o
During a
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
election,
o-o
when you vote
o-o
for a governor,
o-o
secretary of state,
o-o
or president,
o-o
you're actually
o-o
voting for
o-o
someone who
o-o
has promised
o-o
to vote for
o-o
the candidate
o-o
whose name
o-o
you mark on
o-o
your ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
Those people,
o-o
the ones who
o-o
get enough votes,
o-o
are delegates.
sentence-next
o-o
They travel to
o-o
a convention
o-o
where they
o-o
vote on your
o-o
behalf.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why isn't my vote
o-o
counted directly?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Sometimes,
o-o
none of the
o-o
candidates
o-o
gets a majority
o-o
of votes.
sentence-next
o-o
There has to be
o-o
enough support
o-o
to justify
o-o
having just one
o-o
nominee
o-o
on the
o-o
general
o-o
election
o-o
ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
So at the
o-o
convention
o-o
the delegates
o-o
do rounds
o-o
of voting
o-o
until one
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a majority,
o-o
that's half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So we're at
o-o
a nomination
o-o
convention,
o-o
where one of the
o-o
delegates
o-o
is voting
o-o
on my behalf.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
After each round
o-o
of voting,
o-o
if there's no
o-o
majority,
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the fewest
o-o
delegate votes
o-o
usually
o-o
drops out.
sentence-next
o-o
Traditionally
o-o
that candidate
o-o
tells their
o-o
delegates
o-o
who to vote for
o-o
in the next round.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm the one
o-o
spinning
o-o
round and round
o-o
in the
o-o
laundry
o-o
machine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
It can get
o-o
very messy.
sentence-next
o-o
There used to be
o-o
lots of backroom
o-o
deals involved.
sentence-next
o-o
Like promises
o-o
of political
o-o
appointments
o-o
in return for
o-o
a candidate
o-o
telling
o-o
their delegates
o-o
to vote for
o-o
the more popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
who has made
o-o
that promise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
I see,
o-o
lots of tricks
o-o
go on
o-o
to influence
o-o
the delegates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes,
o-o
sometimes
o-o
literally.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact
o-o
sexual bribery
o-o
was common
o-o
before women
o-o
got the right
o-o
to vote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoa!
sentence-next
o-o
Trading a vote
o-o
for sex?
sentence-next
o-o
That's a kind
o-o
of bribery,
o-o
...
o-o
I didn't
o-o
know about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Surely you know,
o-o
wealthy people
o-o
pay lots of
o-o
different
o-o
kinds of helpers
o-o
to influence
o-o
those of us in
o-o
government.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I hadn't known
o-o
about

lobbyists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Here's another

twist.
sentence-next

At the

Democratic

o-o
election,
o-o
where a

presidential
o-o
candidate

is chosen,
o-o
there are

super delegates
o-o
who weren't

elected by
o-o
the voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow,
o-o
super
o-o
extra
o-o
layers
o-o
of corrup...,

of extra

influence.
sentence-next
o-o
Just to get

this

majority
o-o
thingy.
sentence-next
o-o
Why is that

so damned

important?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
There's something
o-o
in politics
o-o
called
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What do spittin'

with politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not goats.
sentence-next
o-o
Votes.
sentence-next

As in voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Vote spittin'?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not spitting,
o-o
although
o-o
spitting
o-o
used to happen
o-o
in Congress
o-o
so often
o-o
they had
o-o
spittoons.
sentence-next
o-o
It's splitting,
o-o
vote splitting,

and it's the

election version
o-o
of divide and

conquer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N divide 'n

Isn't that the

battle tactic
o-o
armies use when

they separate
o-o
enemy
o-o
soldiers from

one another?
sentence-next
o-o
'N then they can

attack the

smaller groups
o-o
when they're

aloner?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes, and in fact,
o-o
voting is
o-o
rooted in war
o-o
and fighting.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why women
o-o
didn't vote.
sentence-next
o-o
They weren't counted
o-o
because they
o-o
don't fight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those rule makers
o-o
never met my

uncle's
o-o
ex hyphen-here wife.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
So voting
o-o
started out
o-o
as counting
o-o
to figure
o-o
out how many
o-o
men would be
o-o
in each army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And two small armies
o-o
would lose against
o-o
one bigger army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes,
o-o
if the big army
o-o
can fight just one
o-o
small army
o-o
at a time.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what dividing

the enemy enables.
sentence-next

That's why Lincoln

said a house divided

cannot stand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, so long ago
o-o
votin' began

'N the smaller

army surrenders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Saves a lot of dying,

no?
sentence-next
o-o
And when splitting

can't be done
o-o
physically,
o-o
then splitting
o-o
psychologically
o-o
works too.

o-o
In politics,

that's what
o-o
religious

and racial
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences
o-o
do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how does this

vote splitting
o-o
work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Well, it involves

math.

all works.
sentence-next

I just know that

So we, the
