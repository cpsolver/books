So what's the
o-o
barrier against
o-o
using ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Up until a few
o-o
decades ago, when
o-o
computers came along,
o-o
doing the math by hand
o-o
was the big barrier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But now we have
o-o
computers, so
o-o
what's stopping us
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fear.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
a fear of math.
sentence-next
o-o
Officially
o-o
that's called
o-o
mathematical
o-o
anxiety.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of people
o-o
have it 'cause
o-o
most people
o-o
don't trust what
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Math
o-o
anxiety.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what I
o-o
was infected
o-o
by.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
don't want
o-o
anyone
o-o
to cut the
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
they use to
o-o
control
o-o
politicians.
sentence-next
o-o
And their minions,
o-o
the insiders
o-o
within the two
o-o
political
o-o
parties,
o-o
don't want to
o-o
get fired.
sentence-next
o-o
Or lose their
o-o
perks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why isn't the
o-o
benefit
o-o
of greater
o-o
fairness
o-o
attracting
o-o
voters like a
o-o
magnet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You are so
o-o
na&#239;ve.
sentence-next
o-o
Greedy folks
o-o
are in control
o-o
and they don't want
o-o
fairness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those of us
o-o
who are
o-o
workin' hard
o-o
yet sufferin'
o-o
want our fair share
o-o
of the
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And rich people
o-o
want to protect
o-o
their too hyphen-here big slice
o-o
of economic pie,
o-o
probably with
o-o
vanilla
o-o
ice cream and
o-o
three cherries
o-o
on top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Speaking of that,
o-o
here are colored blocks
o-o
that represent
o-o
nine ballots,
o-o
and the colors
o-o
represent
o-o
ice cream flavors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Pretty colors!
sentence-next
o-o
Which flavors?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Dark brown is
o-o
chocolate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yum!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pink is for
o-o
strawberry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not a fan
o-o
of pink.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This color represents
o-o
mint chocolate
o-o
chip.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I presume
o-o
the last color
o-o
is vanilla.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But you haven't
o-o
explained why
o-o
you're pointing
o-o
out these nine
o-o
colored blocks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Each stack
o-o
represents
o-o
one ballot,
o-o
with the voter's
o-o
favorite
o-o
on top,
o-o
and least hyphen-here favorite
o-o
on bottom.
sentence-next
o-o
With these nine
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
the winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla,
o-o
depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As usual,
o-o
brown always
o-o
loses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, I see
o-o
the counting
o-o
method
o-o
matters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
sentence-next
o-o
And yet,
o-o
almost any
o-o
method is better
o-o
than what we've
o-o
got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So now
o-o
do we know
o-o
all about voting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And how math
o-o
can solve the
o-o
conflicts
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Another bit
o-o
you can learn
o-o
about later,
o-o
when you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
It will be
o-o
improvements
o-o
in how members
o-o
of Congress,
o-o
or a
o-o
parliament,
o-o
will vote to
o-o
decide which
o-o
bills should pass
o-o
to become
o-o
laws.
sentence-next
o-o
But getting
o-o
that math right
o-o
is too advanced
o-o
for you now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
not giving
o-o
my drowning
o-o
birdbrain
o-o
a migraine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And you should know
o-o
that electing
o-o
city council
o-o
members
o-o
sometimes
o-o
doesn't involve
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
sentence-next
o-o
In that case
o-o
having three
o-o
councilors
o-o
from each district
o-o
is a good choice.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha
What does that
o-o
accomplish?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With the math
o-o
we've been
o-o
talking about,
o-o
if the winner
o-o
of the first seat
o-o
is backed by
o-o
lots of money
o-o
from business 
o-o
owners,
o-o
the second hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner would
o-o
represent
o-o
employees,
o-o
because they
o-o
outnumber
o-o
business owners.
sentence-next
o-o
If both
o-o
of those winners
o-o
are male
o-o
and white,
o-o
likely the
o-o
third seat
o-o
will be
o-o
a woman
o-o
or a
o-o
minority,
o-o
or both.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow.
sentence-next
o-o
Math is
o-o
magical.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wait.
sentence-next
o-o
You haven't
o-o
told us how
o-o
to solve the
o-o
gerrymander
o-o
problem.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
how do we avoid
o-o
district shapes
o-o
that look like
o-o
balloon animals
o-o
made by a clown?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The statewide seats
o-o
take care of that.
sentence-next
o-o
If a party
o-o
dominates
o-o
any district,
o-o
the oppressed
o-o
parties
o-o
will win more
o-o
statewide
o-o
seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a slick
o-o
trick!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's not a trick.
sentence-next
o-o
It's math,
o-o
which can seem
o-o
magical
o-o
to those who
o-o
don't bother
o-o
to learn it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
So now,
o-o
let's suppose
o-o
that elections
o-o
become fair.
sentence-next
o-o
What will change,
o-o
politically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
especially
o-o
for the

unfortunate
o-o
poor.

o-o
And us college
o-o
grads who failed
o-o
to get to
o-o
the middle
o-o
class.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The answer to that
o-o
I don't know.
sentence-next
o-o
For that you need
o-o
to ask someone
o-o
who understands both
o-o
economics and
o-o
game theory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Video game
o-o

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's an academic field
o-o
that studies, well,

it's difficult to

sentence-next
o-o
But it includes
o-o
vote counting.
sentence-next
o-o
I do know someone

with those credentials.
sentence-next
o-o
But he's at a

that's a three hyphen-here hour

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do you think he'd
o-o
give us a peek

into that
o-o
future?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I can ask him
o-o
by email.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be super!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He studies,
o-o
and teaches about,
o-o
economic history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The history
o-o
of economics?
sentence-next
o-o
That sounds like
o-o
a snooze fest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The history
o-o
of economics
o-o
is indeed boring,
o-o
for most of us.
sentence-next
o-o
But that's
o-o
different from 
o-o
economic
o-o
history,
o-o
which is what
o-o
he teaches.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the study
o-o
of economies

times.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I hate
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
As much as

I did

mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This professor

can make

history fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can that be done?

o-o
'N economics,
o-o
that's more math.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You did great
o-o
understanding
o-o
some history about
o-o
mathematics.
sentence-next
o-o
As for math in
o-o
economics,
o-o
it's just different
o-o
names for money
o-o
categories.
sentence-next
o-o
Like tax, debt,
o-o
interest,
o-o
subsidies,
o-o
and tariffs.

campaign contributions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And you'll hear

about

percentages.
end-lyric

Which just means

You can

handle it.

I'm a dummy

One more tip.
sentence-next
o-o
There's something

sentence-next
o-o
It's a misuse of

Math doesn't lie,

until I do the

o-o
myself.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So, we've
o-o
learned that
o-o
ranked choice ballots

sentence-next
o-o
So just remember

the concept of

sentence-next
o-o
And needing more

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Half's a fraction
o-o
I can recall.

But I don't

why you made a

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It took our

In a similar way
o-o
folks in the

pairwise counting

Zero as a digit

Similarly
