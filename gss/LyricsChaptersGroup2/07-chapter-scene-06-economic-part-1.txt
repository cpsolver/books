Can we call you

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's far better
o-o
than what some
o-o
of my students
o-o
call me
o-o
online,
o-o
so sure.
o-o
Welcome to my
o-o
classroom.
o-o
Would you like some
o-o
pistachios?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm so
o-o
full of nuts
o-o
I could get a
o-o
dozen squirrels
o-o
through winter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We're wired on
o-o
espresso.
o-o
So let's go!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm hungry
o-o
to learn.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We came to learn
o-o
the dark arts
o-o
of economics.
o-o
Please tell us
o-o
what will happen
o-o
in the world
o-o
of money
o-o
when elections
o-o
are fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
When vote splittin's
o-o
no longer
o-o
skewing
o-o
the outcome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not goat
o-o
spitting.
o-o
It's vote
o-o
splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We know it's
o-o
super
o-o
challengin'
o-o
to predict
o-o
the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's mostly what
o-o
us economists
o-o
are paid to do.
o-o
Predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are they,
o-o
well you too,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
usually right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sometimes yes,
o-o
and then we
o-o
modestly say
o-o
begin-italics I told you so end-italics no-space .
o-o
Sometimes no,
o-o
and then we
o-o
apply for a
o-o
research grant
o-o
to study why
o-o
we were wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you get paid more
o-o
if you're wrong?
o-o
Do you own
o-o
a Tesla
o-o
and a home
o-o
that has a
o-o
panoramic
o-o
view?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
your espresso
o-o
is showing.
o-o
Professor,
o-o
do you have a
o-o
general notion
o-o
'bout what will
o-o
change?
o-o
Especially
o-o
in Washington.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course!
o-o
Lots of new laws
o-o
will be
o-o
passed.
o-o
Those laws
o-o
will reduce
o-o
corruption.
o-o
Then a few
o-o
people who
o-o
greatly profit
o-o
from existing
o-o
kinds of
o-o
corruption
o-o
might
o-o
temporarily
o-o
earn less money.
o-o
Almost everyone
o-o
else will enjoy
o-o
increased prosperity.
o-o
And that increase
o-o
later will feed back
o-o
to the ones who
o-o
temporarily
o-o
lost some of their
o-o
income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's your
o-o
justification?
o-o
For that prediction?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That trend has been
o-o
going on throughout
o-o
civilization
o-o
and history.
o-o
Not counting
o-o
setbacks
o-o
caused by
o-o
warfare.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can you
o-o
explain why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Imagine the economy
o-o
as a strawberry pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not fond of
o-o
strawberry pie.
o-o
And apple pie
o-o
is tasteless
o-o
to me as a
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
Can we make it
o-o
more tasty
o-o
and fill it
o-o
with cherries?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course. Now
o-o
imagine the economy
o-o
is a cherry pie.
o-o
If some people
o-o
cut themselves
o-o
a slice that is
o-o
too big, then other
o-o
people end up with
o-o
smaller slices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm following this.
o-o
Wow!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What would you like
o-o
to call the people
o-o
who take too big
o-o
of a slice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
People in the
o-o
political down.
o-o
As opposed to the
o-o
political left
o-o
'n political
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'N we
o-o
the people,
o-o
who get too little,
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Bravo!
o-o
I'll bet you
o-o
had to struggle
o-o
to get your
o-o
bearings
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
jungle.
o-o
So,
o-o
the way I see it,
o-o
if elections
o-o
were fair,
o-o
then elected
o-o
leaders
o-o
would care
o-o
more about
o-o
the people
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up,
o-o
where most
o-o
of us are,
o-o
who get too little
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the part
o-o
we've figured
o-o
out.
o-o
And that
o-o
replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
wouldn't lie
o-o
...
o-o
as much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, those
o-o
replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
would pass laws
o-o
that give bigger
o-o
slices of
o-o
economic
o-o
pie
o-o
to the
o-o
majority
o-o
of voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So far
o-o
this is
o-o
easier
o-o
than playing
o-o
air guitar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When I took
o-o
economics
o-o
one oh one,
o-o
it wasn't
o-o
this fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We'll get to some
o-o
complicated
o-o
bits swiftly,
o-o
and they involve
o-o
bits of
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o
not silly
o-o
wonky
o-o
history.
o-o
I learned some.
o-o
But I'm done
o-o
with the past.
o-o
It's gone.
o-o
Why do people
o-o
dwell on that
o-o
old stuffy
o-o
stuff?
o-o
Other than
o-o
using it
o-o
to play
o-o
trivia
o-o
games.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here I'm walking
o-o
backwards.
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
this is like
o-o
moving forward
o-o
in time.
o-o
The future
o-o
is behind me
o-o
where I
o-o
cannot see.
o-o
So I look
o-o
where I've been.
o-o
That's the past.
o-o
The patterns
o-o
give me clues
o-o
about
o-o
that which is
o-o
yet to be.
o-o
So history
o-o
is like a
o-o
crystal ball.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I see!
o-o
History
o-o
is a preview
o-o
of the future.
o-o
Who knew?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Many people
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
think that
o-o
history
o-o
is mostly
o-o
recalling
o-o
facts about
o-o
the past.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In a history
o-o
trivia contest
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would beat me
o-o
like the loudest
o-o
drum in a
o-o
marchin' band.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would be
o-o
a great way
o-o
to learn
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wikipedia is wrong
o-o
lots of the time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
About topics
o-o
that affect
o-o
people's
o-o
finances,
o-o
sure.
o-o
But Wikipedia
o-o
is usually
o-o
right about
o-o
non hyphen-here recent
o-o
history.
o-o
Also about
o-o
non hyphen-here medical
o-o
biochemistry,
o-o
basic
o-o
mathematics,
o-o
and movie plots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My eyes are
o-o
cryin'
o-o
just thinkin'
o-o
about reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
so much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said that
o-o
reading glasses
o-o
with a blue tint
o-o
helps with books.
o-o
A good browser
o-o
can change
o-o
Wikipedia's
o-o
white background
o-o
to blue.
o-o
See how that looks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll give that
o-o
trick a try.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Rather than facts,
o-o
what's more useful
o-o
regarding
o-o
history
o-o
is causation.
o-o
Cause and effect.
o-o
And the ones
o-o
that involve
o-o
a surprise
o-o
are the insights
o-o
you should
o-o
prize.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can ya translate
o-o
that into a
o-o
for instance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's start with the
o-o
1950's
o-o
and 1960's
o-o
and into the
o-o
1970's.
o-o
Why was the
o-o
U.S.
o-o
economy
o-o
so
o-o
prosperous?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That was before
o-o
my time so
o-o
I don't know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This has to do
o-o
with World War Two,
o-o
doesn't it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
That war happened
o-o
back in, ...
o-o
well it ended
o-o
in 1945.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But the
o-o
boomer babies
o-o
were born
o-o
and raised,
o-o
and that
o-o
increased
o-o
consumption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does this have
o-o
anything to do with
o-o
not getting bombed
o-o
here in the US?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Except at Pearl
o-o
Harbor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Factories
o-o
and power plants
o-o
throughout
o-o
the world
o-o
were bombed,
o-o
except in
o-o
the United States,
o-o
Canada,
o-o
and less hyphen-here accessible
o-o
parts of
o-o
Russia.
o-o
Why was that
o-o
noteworthy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Unemployment
o-o
here in the states
o-o
was low?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Anyone who wanted
o-o
a factory job
o-o
could get one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Didn't factory jobs
o-o
pay well back then?
o-o
Well enough
o-o
to buy a house?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
and what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't feel
o-o
brainy,
o-o
'cause I don't
o-o
see where
o-o
you're going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What's that called
o-o
when there is only
o-o
one place that sells
o-o
what people
o-o
want to buy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
a monopoly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Oh yeah,
o-o
the entire world
o-o
had to buy
o-o
manufactured
o-o
goods
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
and Canada
o-o
and Russia.
o-o
Because other
o-o
factories
o-o
on the planet
o-o
had become
o-o
dinosaurs,
o-o
wiped out by
o-o
bombs instead
o-o
of an
o-o
asteroid.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And when there's
o-o
a monopoly
o-o
the seller
o-o
can sell
o-o
at high prices,
o-o
which boosts
o-o
the profits.
o-o
And the business
o-o
can pay their
o-o
employees
o-o
better wages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great thinking!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute!
o-o
Is that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity 
o-o
what voters
o-o
think of
o-o
when they hear
o-o
the slogan
o-o
about making
o-o
America
o-o
great again?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
so this is why
o-o
the orange hyphen-here makeup guy
o-o
got so many votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But he blames
o-o
immigrants
o-o
and blacks
o-o
and women
o-o
for the bad
o-o
economy
o-o
we have now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
As the son of
o-o
an immigrant
o-o
family,
o-o
from India,
o-o
I too think
o-o
that's ironic.
o-o
Even worse,
o-o
for voters,
o-o
it's foolish
o-o
to think
o-o
we can regain
o-o
that prior
o-o
prosperity
o-o
by building
o-o
factories.
o-o
Do you see why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The monopoly
o-o
ended,
o-o
because
o-o
other nations
o-o
built new
o-o
factories.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does this mean
o-o
the belief
o-o
that anyone
o-o
can get rich by
o-o
working hard
o-o
has reached
o-o
its expiration
o-o
date?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
History
o-o
reveals
o-o
that prosperity
o-o
happens when a
o-o
city, nation,
o-o
or region
o-o
sells something
o-o
that people outside
o-o
the region
o-o
either need or
o-o
strongly desire.
o-o
And it's not
o-o
available from
o-o
anywhere else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are just
o-o
short blips
o-o
that pass
o-o
like fads,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Do you know what
o-o
the silk road was?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
Marco Polo
o-o
and lots of
o-o
caravans
o-o
traveled along
o-o
it to get silk
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
China was getting
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
things flowing
o-o
into their country
o-o
to pay for the silk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that made
o-o
China rich?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Better than that,
o-o
instead of
o-o
just selling
o-o
spools of silk,
o-o
they wove it into
o-o
begin-italics beautiful end-italics
o-o
fabric
o-o
that was worth
o-o
more than
o-o
its weight
o-o
in gold.
o-o
And they wisely
o-o
kept their special
o-o
silkworms within
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City to
o-o
protect their
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Forbidden
o-o
City's the
o-o
fortress where
o-o
the emperor
o-o
of China
o-o
lived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That monopoly
o-o
lasted for
o-o
centuries.
o-o
So they aren't
o-o
always blips
o-o
in time.
o-o
Also the
o-o
Arabic hyphen-here speaking
o-o
traders
o-o
along the
o-o
middle eastern
o-o
part of the
o-o
silk road
o-o
monopolized
o-o
access
o-o
to that silk,
o-o
and that trade
o-o
monopoly
o-o
also lasted
o-o
for centuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Portuguese
o-o
ships
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Brazil,
o-o
and then
o-o
Columbus
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Caribbean
o-o
Islands.
o-o
They were looking
o-o
for an
o-o
alternate route
o-o
to China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ok,
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are not always
o-o
short blips.
o-o
And I see
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are good for
o-o
sellers
o-o
but bad for
o-o
customers.
o-o
But how does that
o-o
affect today's
o-o
economy?
o-o
It seems like
o-o
rising to
o-o
the middle class
o-o
based on hard work
o-o
is something
o-o
from the past,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not that
o-o
simple.
o-o
Do you know
o-o
about inflation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah!
o-o
The cost of
o-o
rent 'n food
o-o
'n ice cream
o-o
are going up
o-o
and up fast
o-o
while salaries
o-o
suck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
my salary
o-o
stays stuck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
reasons why
o-o
the cost of living
o-o
is going up
o-o
faster than
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
which is the
o-o
official
o-o
measurement
o-o
of inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I remember
o-o
that number
o-o
is corrupt,
o-o
but I forgot
o-o
why it's corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You didn't forget.
o-o
We can't teach why
o-o
to undergrads.
o-o
Part of the why
o-o
is because
o-o
back when the price
o-o
of food items
o-o
were quickly
o-o
rising,
o-o
some food items
o-o
were replaced by
o-o
items whose cost
o-o
were declining.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's declining
o-o
in cost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The per hyphen-here pixel cost
o-o
of digital
o-o
cameras.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize
o-o
that word begin-italics per end-italics no-space .
o-o
It means division.
o-o
And the number
o-o
of pixels in
o-o
a camera
o-o
are going up,
o-o
so dividing by
o-o
that bigger number
o-o
makes the result
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So the
o-o
government
o-o
is hiding the real
o-o
cost of living!
o-o
They're not being
o-o
transparent.
o-o
But something else
o-o
is going on, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Some government
o-o
expenses
o-o
are matched to the
o-o
consumer price
o-o
index.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I remember
o-o
the CPI,
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index.
o-o
It measures
o-o
inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it's linked
o-o
to such things as
o-o
retirement
o-o
pensions for
o-o
government
o-o
employees,
o-o
and social
o-o
security
o-o
benefits,
o-o
and the
o-o
interest
o-o
the government
o-o
pays for
o-o
borrowed
o-o
money.
o-o
So the
o-o
government
o-o
needs inflation
o-o
to stay low.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the government
o-o
basically
o-o
uses tricks
o-o
to pretend
o-o
inflation
o-o
is low,
o-o
so it pays out
o-o
less money,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word tricks
o-o
is a bit rough.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And we can't
o-o
call it corruption,
o-o
or lying,
o-o
or stealing.
o-o
So shall we
o-o
call it an
o-o
intentional
o-o
distortion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Ok,
o-o
as another
o-o
intentional
o-o
distortion,
o-o
the CPI
o-o
excludes
o-o
rent and fuel,
o-o
which are rising
o-o
quickly.
o-o
They're
o-o
excluded
o-o
because they're
o-o
too volatile.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means they
o-o
jump up and down
o-o
like a
o-o
candy hydrogen fueled kid
o-o
in a bouncy
o-o
house
o-o
just before
o-o
naptime.

Is anything else
o-o

Besides
o-o
ice cream

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
do you
o-o
remember from
o-o
econ one oh one
o-o
what determines
o-o
interest rates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The federal
o-o
reserve chooses
o-o
when to increase
o-o
and decrease the
o-o
interest rate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the rate
o-o
talked about
o-o
in the news,
o-o
but more important
o-o
is the rate
o-o
determined by
o-o
auctioning
o-o
treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I don't remember
o-o
learning about
o-o
those actions,
o-o
I mean,
o-o
auctions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not taught to
o-o
undergrads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll bet textbooks
o-o
don't include it
o-o
because schools
o-o
are funded by
o-o
the government.
o-o
So textbooks can't
o-o
reveal secrets
o-o
the government
o-o
wants to hide.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Some
o-o
U.S.
o-o
treasuries
o-o
are sold in
o-o
auctions.
o-o
In economically
o-o
optimistic
o-o
times those
o-o
treasuries
o-o
sell for
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
closer to the
o-o
amount the
o-o
government pays
o-o
when they reach their
o-o
redemption date.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but in
o-o
economically
o-o
pessimistic
o-o
times the buyers
o-o
pay much less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
then the gap
o-o
between
o-o
purchase price
o-o
and redemption
o-o
payment
o-o
increases.
o-o
So that
o-o
brings up rates
o-o
of interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Optimism?
o-o
Pessimism?
o-o
Feelings matter?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You buy more stuff
o-o
when you're
o-o
less afraid
o-o
of the future.
o-o
Like during
o-o
the cheery
o-o
holiday season.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And those feelings
o-o
get measured
o-o
with something
o-o
called
o-o
consumer
o-o
confidence.
o-o
You've heard
o-o
about that,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm a consumer,
o-o
or I try to be,
o-o
but I have no
o-o
confidence.
o-o
In the future.
o-o
And at the moment
o-o
something makes
o-o
no sense.
o-o
Interest rates
o-o
are low.
o-o
That means there's
o-o
lots of buyers
o-o
for those
o-o
...
o-o
things?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
Yes, normally.
o-o
But China and
o-o
Russia stopped
o-o
buying them so
o-o
lately the
o-o
federal reserve
o-o
has been buying
o-o
lots of them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm even
o-o
more confused.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The government
o-o
buying its own
o-o
money,
o-o
that makes
o-o
no sense.
o-o
It would be like
o-o
a plush toy
o-o
dinosaur
o-o
business
o-o
buying its own
o-o
dinos to give
o-o
the appearance
o-o
of extra customers
o-o
and income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's partly
o-o
why the deficit
o-o
is so huge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so the U.S.
o-o
government has
o-o
increased its debt
o-o
to compensate
o-o
for rough times
o-o
economically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a moment.
o-o
Our economy's
o-o
like a stack of
o-o
wood blocks in a
o-o
teetering tower
o-o
that's ready to
o-o
fall?
o-o
Except that
o-o
kind of falling
o-o
will kill
o-o
and maim
o-o
instead of
o-o
just shame?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
All nations
o-o
and all big
o-o
businesses
o-o
are in debt.
o-o
So are farmers.
o-o
They all have to
o-o
borrow first
o-o
before they can
o-o
grow crops or
o-o
manufacture
o-o
or whatever to
o-o
get income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So being in debt
o-o
isn't a big deal,
o-o
but a growing
o-o
debt, that's
o-o
disastrous,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Relatively
o-o
speaking, yes.
o-o
But as long as
o-o
the government
o-o
is keeping its
o-o
citizens happy,
o-o
and happier than
o-o
in other nations,
o-o
problems can be
o-o
hidden behind
o-o
curtains of
o-o
distraction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The number of
o-o
people trying
o-o
to immigrate
o-o
into the U.S.
o-o
is still high.
o-o
So that
o-o
suggests
o-o
success.
o-o
Yet things
o-o
are a mess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what should be
o-o
going on instead?
o-o
Besides
o-o
traveling
o-o
in flying
o-o
cars.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
An important way
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity
o-o
is to increase
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How come
o-o
prosperity
o-o
increases
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your time machine
o-o
is running
o-o
backwards.
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
increases
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Consider the
o-o
Roman empire.
o-o
They wrote laws
o-o
to control
o-o
business and
o-o
commerce.
o-o
And they used
o-o
soldiers and
o-o
inspectors
o-o
and courts
o-o
to enforce
o-o
those laws.
o-o
An especially
o-o
important
o-o
innovation
o-o
was to set
o-o
standards for
o-o
weights and sizes.
o-o
And they built roads
o-o
and patroled them
o-o
with soldiers.
o-o
They built aqueducts
o-o
to channel water
o-o
to cities.
o-o
All of that
o-o
greatly increased
o-o
the efficiency
o-o
of their economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
o-o
Economic
o-o
efficiency?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Economic
o-o
efficiency
o-o
means something
o-o
different.
o-o
Here I'm talking
o-o
about efficiency
o-o
as a general
o-o
concept,
o-o
where profits
o-o
go up
o-o
when costs
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
costs went down
o-o
when those
o-o
Romans wasted
o-o
less time
o-o
fetching water,
o-o
they got sick less
o-o
because they had
o-o
water to wash
o-o
their hands,
o-o
and better roads
o-o
gave them a
o-o
better warranty
o-o
on their
o-o
ox hyphen-here cart wheels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And there was
o-o
less cheating.
o-o
Those inspectors,
o-o
backed up by
o-o
soldiers,
o-o
made sure that
o-o
merchants
o-o
didn't use
o-o
heavier weights
o-o
to measure
o-o
what they bought,
o-o
and lighter weights
o-o
to measure
o-o
the gold and gems
o-o
they paid.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And soldiers
o-o
patrolling
o-o
the better roads
o-o
meant there
o-o
was less
o-o
highway
o-o
robbery
o-o
by bad
o-o
Samaritans.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Less time wasted.
o-o
Less stealing.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
less corruption!
o-o
Like not tying
o-o
left and right
o-o
shoelaces together.
o-o
That makes progress
o-o
without
o-o
unnecessary
o-o
tripping.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is making
o-o
sense to me.
o-o
When there's
o-o
less corruption
o-o
there's less waste.
o-o
That means more time
o-o
goes into
o-o
building things
o-o
worthwhile,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And besides time
o-o
there are other
o-o
resources
o-o
that can get
o-o
wasted.
o-o
Like
o-o
muscle power,
o-o
donkey power,
o-o
brainpower,
o-o
metals,
o-o
stones,
o-o
wood,
o-o
clean water,
o-o
healing herbs,
o-o
and chocolate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Also
o-o
important
o-o
is for there
o-o
to be less
o-o
fighting.
o-o
Not only
o-o
physical
o-o
fighting,
o-o
but fewer
o-o
business disputes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
fighting
o-o
also wastes
o-o
time, money,
o-o
resources, ...
o-o
... and lives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since efficiency
o-o
is so important,
o-o
economists
o-o
measure it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
They think they do.
o-o
They have
o-o
something called
o-o
economic
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
but that's more like
o-o
the gain and loss
o-o
of a cherry pie.
o-o
And they have
o-o
something called the
o-o
productivity
o-o
index.
o-o
But it's flawed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
o-o
You do remember
o-o
some economics.
o-o
The productivity
o-o
index
o-o
is supposed to
o-o
measure
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which is similar
o-o
to efficiency.
o-o
Yet that index
o-o
increases
o-o
when a house
o-o
burns down
o-o
and then
o-o
inexpensively
o-o
gets rebuilt.
o-o
Of course it
o-o
would be even
o-o
more efficient
o-o
if the house
o-o
never burned down.
o-o
But measuring
o-o
non hyphen-here destruction,
o-o
alas that's not
o-o
a sexy topic
o-o
that attracts
o-o
economists'
o-o
attention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it fails
o-o
to account for
o-o
the benefits
o-o
of some kinds
o-o
of socialism,
o-o
like public
o-o
libraries,
o-o
and better
o-o
public
o-o
education.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So if efficiency
o-o
is what made the
o-o
Roman empire
o-o
great,
o-o
why did it
o-o
decline?
o-o
In just a
o-o
sentence or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If all the books
o-o
on this subject
o-o
fell on you,
o-o
you'd get buried
o-o
in an avalanche
o-o
ten feet high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'll try to
o-o
oversimplify.
o-o
After the years of
o-o
good governance
o-o
and
o-o
prosperity,
o-o
corruption grew.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Plus
o-o
a huge source
o-o
of wealth
o-o
for ancient Rome
o-o
was through
o-o
conquest.
o-o
That means stealing.
o-o
But they ran out
o-o
of wealthy places
o-o
to conquer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, the
o-o
Roman army
o-o
invaded
o-o
surrounding
o-o
territories.
o-o
Besides
o-o
stealing
o-o
gold and jewels,
o-o
and crowns and
o-o
tiaras,
o-o
and artwork,
o-o
and sending it
o-o
back to Rome,
o-o
they installed
o-o
tax collectors.
end-lyric


ambee sings-desha amenn
Lots of those
o-o
taxes were paid
o-o
with grains and
o-o
other food
o-o
that fed
o-o
the soldiers
o-o
and the wealthy
o-o
in Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But that ends
o-o
when there's
o-o
no more regions
o-o
to conquer
o-o
and plunder,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Basically
o-o
that's the kids' book
o-o
version of the
o-o
Roman empire.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's the economic
o-o
opposite
o-o
of corruption?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This is going
o-o
to take awhile.
o-o
What I'm wearing
o-o
might go
o-o
out of style.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
multiple
o-o
opposites
o-o
because there are
o-o
multiple
o-o
kinds of
o-o
corruption.
o-o
One opposite is
o-o
the free market.
o-o
You know what that is,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In an ideal free market,
o-o
there are no barriers.
o-o
People can choose
o-o
what to buy,
o-o
what to sell,
o-o
how much to charge,
o-o
and whatever else,
o-o
without fighting.
o-o
That's a fluid,
o-o
flexible,
o-o
and efficient,
o-o
economy.
o-o
But corruption?
o-o
That puts up barriers
o-o
that are chosen
o-o
to channel money
o-o
into specific pockets.
o-o
Those corrupt
o-o
barriers
o-o
reduce
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I've
o-o
got it.
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
and stealing from
o-o
foreigners is
o-o
what brings money
o-o
into a region.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which causes
o-o
economic
o-o
decline.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a bit
o-o
fuzzy but ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My butt's fuzzy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If you say so.
o-o
I can see
o-o
it's firm.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Perhaps I should
o-o
clarify.
o-o
A similar kind of
o-o
rise and fall
o-o
pattern happened
o-o
later with the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
o-o
It started with
o-o
efficient banking.
o-o
Plus improved ships
o-o
and navigation
o-o
using technology
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The compass, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the ship's
o-o
rudder.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Of course
o-o
gunpowder.
o-o
And the digit zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You're astute!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No my ass
o-o
didn't toot!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Astute.
o-o
It means your brain
o-o
just did the
o-o
equivalent of
o-o
a gymnastics
o-o
triple twist
o-o
vault
o-o
with a perfect
o-o
landing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh thanks!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Gunpowder
o-o
empowered
o-o
Europeans
o-o
to explode, ...
o-o
to exploit ...
o-o
the native
o-o
people in the
o-o
Americas.
o-o
Now I realize
o-o
that using
o-o
big tall ships
o-o
to transport
o-o
silk and some
o-o
other stuff
o-o
between
o-o
Asia and
o-o
Europe
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The other stuff
o-o
included
o-o
gold, salt,
o-o
ivory,
o-o
frankincense,
o-o
toga fabric,
o-o
and their
o-o
equivalent
o-o
of Reeses
o-o
peanut butter
o-o
cups.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
...
o-o
I realize that
o-o
running into
o-o
America and
o-o
taking land from
o-o
the natives,
o-o
and enslaving
o-o
Africans to work
o-o
on plantations
o-o
in the Caribbean,
o-o
was an
o-o
economic
o-o
bonus.
o-o
And giving
o-o
religious folks
o-o
a place where they
o-o
could escape
o-o
competing
o-o
religions
o-o
was just, for us,
o-o
a lucky byproduct?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Basically, yes.
o-o
It gave
o-o
democracy
o-o
a place to grow,
o-o
far away from
o-o
big armies
o-o
and navies.
o-o
The resulting
o-o
cooperation
o-o
among U.S. states
o-o
led to immense
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
It was so much
o-o
more efficient
o-o
than
o-o
guilds,
o-o
secret
o-o
societies,
o-o
fraternal
o-o
organizations,
o-o
and nepotism.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's nepo...
o-o
whatever.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hiring family members.
o-o
And friends.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't that a
o-o
no hyphen-here brainer?
o-o
Hiring based on
o-o
skills and
o-o
a good
o-o
word-resume no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Hiring
o-o
relatives
o-o
and friends
o-o
channels wealth
o-o
selfishly
o-o
for short hyphen-here term gains.
o-o
Instead of
o-o
wisely
o-o
for long hyphen-here term
o-o
gains.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another kind of
o-o
corruption!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In hindsight
o-o
those outdated
o-o
traditions
o-o
can be seen as
o-o
corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And inefficient,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Very much so.
o-o
That's why
o-o
a couple
o-o
centuries later
o-o
Europeans
o-o
formed the
o-o
European
o-o
Union.
o-o
They abandoned
o-o
fighting between
o-o
Catholics and
o-o
Protestants.
o-o
And they
o-o
abandoned
o-o
fighting over
o-o
language
o-o
differences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And they stopped
o-o
having food fights
o-o
about table
o-o
etiquette.
o-o
And European
o-o
governments
o-o
now allow women
o-o
some seats in

Instead they are
o-o
copying
o-o
the clear
o-o
success of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
that works so well
o-o
in the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said fighting
o-o
undermines the
o-o
economy.
o-o
Yet political hawks,
o-o
who are mostly
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
promote warfare
o-o
as a way to
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
And competition
o-o
between
o-o
nations,
o-o
and between
o-o
businesses,
o-o
is the basis
o-o
of prosperity
o-o
in a free market,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm lost.
o-o
I feel like I'm
o-o
in a maze and
o-o
someone turned off
o-o
the lights.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Competition
o-o
between
o-o
businesses
o-o
provides
o-o
motivation
o-o
to work hard.
o-o
But what gets
o-o
overlooked is
o-o
the teamwork,
o-o
the
o-o
cooperation,
o-o
between
o-o
employees.
o-o
And the
o-o
cooperation
o-o
between
o-o
citizens
o-o
within the same
o-o
nation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hmm.
o-o
So teamwork
o-o
is more than
o-o
touchy hyphen-here feely
o-o
games?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, employees
o-o
getting along,
o-o
who wouldn't
o-o
normally get along.
o-o
Like employees
o-o
ignoring
o-o
racial differences,
o-o
religious
o-o
differences,
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, and Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
ignoring their
o-o
differences
o-o
while at work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When these
o-o
conflicts
o-o
are ignored,
o-o
that's cooperation.
o-o
Ah, that increases
o-o
efficiency
o-o
begin-italics within end-italics the business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So cooperation
o-o
within a business
o-o
makes the business
o-o
strong,
o-o
so it can better
o-o
compete against
o-o
other
o-o
businesses?
o-o
The lights are
o-o
coming back on.
o-o
I think I see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So fighting
o-o
between groups
o-o
of people
o-o
inspires,
o-o
motivates,
o-o
cooperation
o-o
within each
o-o
group?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not a bad
o-o
simplification.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And a lack
o-o
of cooperation
o-o
is why
o-o
climate change
o-o
is turning
o-o
our planet
o-o
into toast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Some big kinds of
o-o
cooperation,
o-o
like
o-o
public schools,
o-o
food for the poor,
o-o
hospitals, and
o-o
orphanages
o-o
for little
o-o
orphan
o-o
Annies,
o-o
were created
o-o
by churches,
o-o
and promoted by
o-o
religions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Religion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Ancient priests
o-o
in Egypt earned
o-o
their grain and beer
o-o
by predicting
o-o
eclipses
o-o
so their boss,
o-o
the pharaoh,
o-o
could pretend
o-o
to be powerful.
o-o
And they
o-o
predicted
o-o
when the Nile
o-o
River would
o-o
flood and recede.
o-o
Plus each year
o-o
priests used
o-o
mathematics
o-o
and surveying
o-o
to lay out
o-o
that year's
o-o
farming
o-o
boundaries.
o-o
All of that was
o-o
like magic
o-o
to people who
o-o
didn't understand
o-o
astronomy,
o-o
weather,
o-o
geometry,
o-o
and fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Galileo
o-o
was a threat to the
o-o
Catholic Church.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Because
o-o
he made
o-o
ditsy
o-o
people
o-o
dizzy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He showed that
o-o
science
o-o
was better than
o-o
priests
o-o
at those
o-o
brainy
o-o
skills.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And priests lost
o-o
lots of
o-o
credibility,
o-o
plus their lives,
o-o
during the
o-o
European
o-o
black death
o-o
by praying
o-o
at the bedside
o-o
of the dying.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And they sold
o-o
holy water
o-o
that failed
o-o
to cure the sick,
o-o
they extorted
o-o
money for
o-o
pardoning sins,
o-o
and their
o-o
version of
o-o
a trip to
o-o
Disneyland
o-o
was a long
o-o
pilgrimage
o-o
to kneel before
o-o
the pelvic
o-o
bone of
o-o
Saint Bernard
o-o
of
o-o
Piddlesbourough.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those priests
o-o
would have flunked
o-o
out of
o-o
medical
o-o
school.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of what
o-o
was once done by
o-o
religion
o-o
has split into
o-o
science,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
public
o-o
education,
o-o
and
o-o
government.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What would
o-o
happen if we,
o-o
the majority

leaders who care?
o-o
How would those
o-o
leaders
o-o
change the U.S.
o-o
economy?
o-o
You've said they would
o-o
reduce corruption,
o-o
which will
o-o
increase
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which will
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
And there
o-o
would be more
o-o
cooperation.
o-o
What else
o-o
would change?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When an economy
o-o
is not blocked
o-o
by wealthy people
o-o
who cling to
o-o
corruption,
o-o
there are many
o-o
opportunities
o-o
for new kinds of

business
o-o
based on
o-o
innovation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Computers
o-o
and the

internet
o-o
are big
o-o
innovations.
o-o
But most people
o-o
seem to use them
o-o
to yell
o-o
at strangers,
o-o
gawk at
o-o
celebrities,
o-o
and watch
o-o
mindless
o-o
videos.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, ...
o-o
Amazon
o-o
has created
o-o
lots of software,
o-o
innovative
o-o
software,
o-o
that replaces the

inefficiency
o-o
of people
o-o
selling stuff
o-o
in retail
o-o
stores.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I've worked in
o-o
retail stores.
o-o
Talk about
o-o
inefficiency.
o-o
I had to
o-o
count out change
o-o
when someone
o-o
handed me
o-o
cash.
o-o
We wasted time
o-o
watching
o-o
suspicious
o-o
customers
o-o
in case they did
o-o
petty theft.
o-o
And countless
o-o
customers
o-o
interrupted
o-o
me because
o-o
they were too
o-o
lazy to read
o-o
the signs.
o-o
Especially
o-o
the big one
o-o
with a big arrow
o-o
that said
o-o
begin-italics
restrooms
end-italics
no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Amazon
o-o
eliminates
o-o
cash,
o-o
theft, and
o-o
restrooms.
o-o
That increases
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
and reduces
o-o
waste.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it increases
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for Jeff
o-o
Bezos.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's something else
o-o
that shouldn't be
o-o
wasted.
o-o
It's difficult
o-o
to measure,
o-o
so it's easily
o-o
overlooked.
o-o
Consider what
o-o
happened in Britain
o-o
during World War One.
o-o
It was popular for
o-o
university hyphen-here educated men
o-o
to volunteer to fight
o-o
in that war.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
They got slaughtered
o-o
in the trenches.
o-o
Lots of knowledge
o-o
and lots of skills
o-o
died with them.
o-o
What a waste.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And that reduced
o-o
the people
o-o
who could
o-o
educate
o-o
the next
o-o
generation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so that's why
o-o
men in college
o-o
get excluded
o-o
when there's a
o-o
military
o-o
draft.
o-o
I see.
o-o
Knowledge and skills
o-o
are also resources
o-o
that can get
o-o
used wisely,
o-o
or wasted.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Or lost.
o-o
During the
o-o
European
o-o
black death,
o-o
lots of blacksmiths
o-o
and ship builders
o-o
and court jesters
o-o
died.
o-o
With them died
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
knowledge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Jesters
o-o
knew how to
o-o
juggle
o-o
pig bladders
o-o
and chew berries
o-o
at the same time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back before
o-o
Netflix and
o-o
the iPod
o-o
and radio,
o-o
even before
o-o
record players,
o-o
music and jokes
o-o
and dances
o-o
could only be
o-o
heard or seen in
o-o
the presence of
o-o
musicians,
o-o
storytellers,
o-o
dancers, and
o-o
jesters.
o-o
If they died
o-o
without passing
o-o
along what
o-o
they knew,
o-o
their
o-o
melodious songs,
o-o
spellbinding
o-o
stories,
o-o
tantalizing
o-o
dances,
o-o
and hilarious
o-o
jokes
o-o
got lost.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, death.
o-o
It takes so much away.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In those times
o-o
horseshoes,
o-o
swords, and
o-o
sailing ships
o-o
were high
o-o
technology.
o-o
That's why blacksmiths
o-o
and ship builders
o-o
were so
o-o
valuable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is this
o-o
related
o-o
to why humans
o-o
haven't
o-o
recently
o-o
walked on the moon?
o-o
Losing knowledge?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes.
o-o
The people
o-o
who knew how to
o-o
put them there
o-o
are dead,
o-o
or retired.
o-o
And some written
o-o
knowledge on
o-o
computer
o-o
hard drives
o-o
was erased.
o-o
On the bright side,
o-o
the opposite
o-o
of losing
o-o
knowledge
o-o
is gaining
o-o
knowledge.
o-o
That's what gave
o-o
strength to the
o-o
Islamic
o-o
Golden Age.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's when Bagdad
o-o
was the center
o-o
of an empire
o-o
of people who
o-o
spoke Arabic
o-o
and followed
o-o
the religion
o-o
of Islam.
o-o
A wise ruler,
o-o
whose name I don't
o-o
remember ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
...
o-o
Harun al hyphen-here Rashid,
o-o
at the end of
o-o
the seven hundreds ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
...
o-o
collected books
o-o
and gathered
o-o
wise scholars
o-o
from around the world,
o-o
and paid smart people
o-o
to develop things
o-o
like algebra,
o-o
geometry,
o-o
and ...,
o-o
I forget what else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Medicine,
o-o
three D drawings,
o-o
robotic mechanisms,
o-o
papermaking,
o-o
and much more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that when
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
made its way
o-o
closer to Europe?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes, and why
o-o
Europeans
o-o
and we refer
o-o
to the digits
o-o
zero through nine
o-o
as Arabic
o-o
numerals.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus plus.
o-o
And that empire
o-o
became weak
o-o
as a result
o-o
of what?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Corruption
o-o
I'll bet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, including
o-o
a dismissal
o-o
of science.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
People who
o-o
dismiss science
o-o
are doubly stupid.
o-o
And I'll bet
o-o
some of them
o-o
are capitalists
o-o
who fail to see
o-o
that the loss of
o-o
science leads the
o-o
economy
o-o
into a death
o-o
spiral.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
About
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
how come it
o-o
so often wins
o-o
against
o-o
knowledge?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Dictators
o-o
and wannabe
o-o
dictators
o-o
outlaw or
o-o
monopolize
o-o
knowledge.
o-o
When Mao Zedong
o-o
led China
o-o
he destroyed books
o-o
and banished
o-o
intellectuals
o-o
to manual hyphen-here labor
o-o
jobs.
o-o
That undermined
o-o
the economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Chinese spies
o-o
steal secrets
o-o
of technology
o-o
from us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since
o-o
Europeans
o-o
got lots of
o-o
inventions
o-o
from China,
o-o
did earlier
o-o
Chinese rulers
o-o
do better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Chinese emperors
o-o
feared losing
o-o
what they called
o-o
the mandate
o-o
of heaven.
o-o
What we call
o-o
the right to rule.
o-o
Especially
o-o
they feared
o-o
natural
o-o
disasters.
o-o
That's because
o-o
too many deaths
o-o
caused by flood,
o-o
or earthquakes,
o-o
or crop failure,
o-o
would lead to
o-o
rebellion and
o-o
revolution.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
Congress lost
o-o
the mandate
o-o
of heaven
o-o
long ago.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To prevent
o-o
catastrophes
o-o
Chinese leaders
o-o
hired and
o-o
promoted
o-o
based on
o-o
competence
o-o
instead of
o-o
nepotism
o-o
and favoritism.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So innovation
o-o
is good.
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
we need more
o-o
innovative
o-o
politicians
o-o
like Bernie
o-o
Sanders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
He promotes
o-o
socialism,
o-o
but that's not
o-o
innovation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't
o-o
socialism
o-o
better than
o-o
capitalism?
o-o
Because it's
o-o
based on
o-o
cooperation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
No because
o-o
free markets
o-o
more quickly
o-o
arrive at the
o-o
most efficient
o-o
networks and
o-o
interdependencies.
o-o
In contrast,
o-o
socialism
o-o
attempts to
o-o
control
o-o
markets
o-o
from the top down,
o-o
using quotas,
o-o
and penalties,
o-o
and fixing
o-o
prices,
o-o
such as the price
o-o
of sugar and
o-o
chocolate.
o-o
But those rules
o-o
can't change as fast
o-o
as what happens
o-o
at the bottom
o-o
of the economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wanna see
o-o
if I'm
o-o
understanding.
o-o
...
o-o
A free and
o-o
efficient
o-o
market's like
o-o
letting water
o-o
find its own way
o-o
to the ocean?
o-o
Instead of
o-o
trying to
o-o
redirect
o-o
rivers.
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a useful
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
And now,
o-o
finally,
o-o
you're ready to
o-o
understand
o-o
something
o-o
important
o-o
that doesn't have
o-o
a name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Bring it on!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's a very
o-o
effective
o-o
way for a
o-o
government
o-o
to increase
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
The first half
o-o
is to begin-italics decrease
o-o
taxes end-italics on
o-o
begin-italics business end-italics
o-o
activities
o-o
that are efficient
o-o
and bring a net flow
o-o
of money into
o-o
the region.
o-o
The second half
o-o
is to begin-italics increase
o-o
taxes end-italics on
o-o
begin-italics business end-italics
o-o
activities
o-o
that are
o-o
inefficient,
o-o
wasteful, or
o-o
plunder
o-o
the locals
o-o
in the style of
o-o
New Jersey
o-o
lawyers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So,
o-o
besides lawyers,
o-o
which
o-o
business
o-o
activities
o-o
are which?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's consider
o-o
some different
o-o
kinds of businesses.
o-o
How about farming?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That brings money in.
o-o
If the crops are sold
o-o
outside the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Which is part of
o-o
why farmers get
o-o
lots of special
o-o
government
o-o
subsidies.
o-o
How about manufacturing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That brings money in,
o-o
when the products 
o-o
are sold outside
o-o
the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought that
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses
o-o
were bad.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when the
o-o
industrial
o-o
revolution
o-o
began,
o-o
that was common.
o-o
Owners used
o-o
greedy shortcuts.
o-o
And still
o-o
there are some
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses
o-o
that treat laws
o-o
as if they're
o-o
optional
o-o
suggested
o-o
guidelines.
o-o
But today's
o-o
transgressions
o-o
are mild compared
o-o
to earlier times.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
A
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
business
o-o
doesn't need to be
o-o
bad.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If there were
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
for good
o-o
manufacturing
o-o
businesses,
o-o
that would reward
o-o
them for
o-o
efficiently
o-o
hiring skilled
o-o
workers who
o-o
transform raw
o-o
materials
o-o
into valuable
o-o
products worth
o-o
lots of money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So software
o-o
businesses
o-o
would get lower
o-o
taxes too?
o-o
They bring lots of money
o-o
into the United States
o-o
from other nations,
o-o
and they just consume
o-o
electricity.
o-o
And they hire highly
o-o
skilled software
o-o
developers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great example.
o-o
How about mining
o-o
companies?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They bring lots of
o-o
money into the U.S.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But the U.S.
o-o
loses lots of
o-o
natural
o-o
resources
o-o
that future
o-o
generations
o-o
will come to miss,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Like Japan,
o-o
where they cut down
o-o
their forests for
o-o
firewood.
o-o
Now they buy
o-o
lots of timber
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
Or did back when
o-o
massive logging
o-o
was done in the
o-o
Pacific
o-o
Northwest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So mining and
o-o
timber businesses
o-o
deserve to pay
o-o
higher taxes,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics deserve end-italics
o-o
is judgemental,
o-o
so that's a matter
o-o
of opinion.
o-o
There might be times
o-o
when name-desha thinks
o-o
you deserve to be
o-o
spanked with a
o-o
wet towel,
o-o
but that would be
o-o
a judgement,
o-o
not a fact.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In this case
o-o
it's a fact.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
But, yes, if
o-o
mining and timber
o-o
industries export
o-o
lots of materials
o-o
now, then future
o-o
generations
o-o
will not have those
o-o
resources to
o-o
use, sell,
o-o
or waste.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Short hyphen-here sighted capitalists.
o-o
Speaking of that,
o-o
what's capitalism?
o-o
It's confusing to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's because
o-o
the word really
o-o
has different
o-o
meanings
o-o
in different
o-o
situations.
o-o
Of course textbooks
o-o
carefully
o-o
define it,
o-o
but those
o-o
definitions
o-o
use words that
o-o
don't fully capture
o-o
exactly
o-o
what it means
o-o
every time
o-o
it's used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which explains why
o-o
so much of what I
o-o
learned in school
o-o
now seems like snow
o-o
on a sunny
o-o
hillside.
o-o
It's long gone.
o-o
But this,
o-o
what you're
o-o
teaching us,
o-o
reveals
o-o
so many
o-o
secrets
o-o
that lie beneath
o-o
puzzling
o-o
mysteries,
o-o
of why things are
o-o
the way they are.
o-o
So I think
o-o
I'll remember
o-o
most of it
o-o
for a long time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's a joy to
o-o
really get to teach
o-o
what's important!
o-o
Now, back to what
o-o
doesn't have an
o-o
official name.
o-o
How about artists,
o-o
writers, composers,
o-o
and other people
o-o
who create things
o-o
that can be sold
o-o
for way more than
o-o
the cost of electricity
o-o
and art supplies
o-o
and creative software?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Clearly they deserve,
o-o
er, should get,
o-o
lower taxes on their
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's this called?
o-o
This thing of
o-o
imposing
o-o
lower taxes
o-o
on businesses
o-o
that efficiently
o-o
create things of value.
o-o
And imposing
o-o
higher taxes
o-o
on businesses
o-o
that waste resources.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Or don't attract
o-o
as much money
o-o
into the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The only name
o-o
I've heard is
o-o
begin-italics tax the makers
o-o
less than the
o-o
takers. end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I like that.
o-o
People like me
o-o
who wanna make things
o-o
would earn higher
o-o
wages because
o-o
of those lower
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And corporations
o-o
would pay much
o-o
higher taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some corporations
o-o
would pay higher
o-o
taxes.
o-o
Other corporations
o-o
create lots of
o-o
valuable products
o-o
and services,
o-o
and they would pay
o-o
lower taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which corporations
o-o
create value?
o-o
I thought that big
o-o
corporations
o-o
are predatory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Admittedly
o-o
big corporations
o-o
do tend to be
o-o
greedy.
o-o
Yet when a biz
o-o
is young
o-o
and small
o-o
and sparsely
o-o
funded,
o-o
it can't grow
o-o
if it doesn't
o-o
offer something
o-o
that benefits
o-o
lots of people.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I have my doubts
o-o
about that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are there
o-o
examples?
o-o
Something from
o-o
history?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when Google
o-o
started out,
o-o
it gave better
o-o
search results,
o-o
and fewer ads,
o-o
especially
o-o
on the first
o-o
results page.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now Google
o-o
hides its ads
o-o
on the websites
o-o
it sends people to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Amazon
o-o
started as
o-o
a bookstore
o-o
that gave
o-o
beginning
o-o
book authors
o-o
a way to
o-o
bypass the
o-o
monopolistic
o-o
New York City
o-o
book publishers
o-o
who were
o-o
inefficiently
o-o
renting
o-o
New York City
o-o
office space.
o-o
Bank of
o-o
America,
o-o
when it was
o-o
started in San
o-o
Fransisco,
o-o
it catered to
o-o
the special needs
o-o
of wealthy
o-o
Chinese
o-o
Americans
o-o
in Chinatown,
o-o
back when
o-o
other banks
o-o
shunned Asian
o-o
Americans as
o-o
customers.
o-o
What's important
o-o
to realize
o-o
is there are lots
o-o
of begin-italics small end-italics
o-o
corporations
o-o
you've never
o-o
heard of
o-o
that benefit
o-o
lots of people
o-o
in lots of
o-o
wonderful
o-o
ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like with
o-o
rich people?
o-o
Some are good,
o-o
and some are bad?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
o-o
And I'm glad
o-o
you see that
o-o
simply taxing
o-o
wealthy individuals
o-o
isn't the key.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I learned
o-o
they can hide
o-o
vacation

o-o
So they can evade

taxation.
o-o
'N exploit tax

o-o
in their

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it's harder
o-o
to figure out
o-o
which rich folks
o-o
deserve to be
o-o
wealthy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
None of them!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Can you not think
o-o
of any wealthy
o-o
people who deserve
o-o
to earn lots of
o-o
money for their work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My boss,
o-o
and other
o-o
owners of small
o-o
construction
o-o
businesses
o-o
like the one
o-o
I work in.
o-o
And maybe
o-o
Elon Musk
o-o
because he's
o-o
rocketizing cars
o-o
and car hyphen-here izing rockets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But he's a jerk.
o-o
And probably
o-o
his real reason
o-o
for going to Mars
o-o
is to evade
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
So was Bill Gates
o-o
in his early years.
o-o
Being a jerk,
o-o
I mean.
o-o
But here we're
o-o
just talking
o-o
about whether
o-o
they've done things
o-o
that strengthen the
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
Oprah Winfrey
o-o
deserves
o-o
her wealth.
o-o
And Stephen
o-o
Colbert begin-explain pronounced begin-italics cole-BARE end-italics end-explain

o-o
he makes me

laugh about
o-o
the crazy

politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They're all
o-o
in the political

up, along with
o-o
us voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's hard to judge
o-o
which individuals
o-o
are in what
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up versus down.
o-o
It's easier to do
o-o
with businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With individuals
o-o
we just need to look
o-o
at how much they give
o-o
to politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Following the
o-o
flow of money
o-o
in politics
o-o
is like slicing
o-o
an onion.
o-o
There are lots
o-o
of layers
o-o
to cut through,
o-o
and it becomes
o-o
hard to see
o-o
because
o-o
tears come to
o-o
your eyes.
o-o
It's easier to
o-o
separate the
o-o
takers from the makers
o-o
in businesses.
o-o
We look at
o-o
what the biz
o-o
does.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What if the biz
o-o
does both?
o-o
Making and
o-o
taking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We can prorate it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Get professionals
o-o
to rate the
o-o
business?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Prorating.
o-o
It's another
o-o
kind of
o-o
division.
o-o
The math kind.
o-o
It involves
o-o
percentages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, OK.
o-o
But my brain's
o-o
startin' to drain
o-o
'cause this seems like
o-o
sorting peaches
o-o
from apricots.
o-o
Is there some
o-o
pattern?
o-o
I mean
o-o
for sorting
o-o
takers from
o-o
makers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In general the
o-o
spectrum from
o-o
makers to takers
o-o
would be something
o-o
like this.
o-o
It starts with
o-o
farming and ranching.
o-o
Then to manufacturing,
o-o
cooking, brewing,
o-o
entertaining,
o-o
engineering,
o-o
inventing,
o-o
software developing,
o-o
oil refining,
o-o
research if it isn't
o-o
market research,
o-o
and other such
o-o
making activities.
o-o
Then to
o-o
teaching and training.
o-o
Then to healthcare,
o-o
grocery sales,
o-o
meat packing,
o-o
canning,
o-o
and maintenance.
o-o
Then to shipping,
o-o
retail stores,
o-o
hospitality,
o-o
and more.
o-o
Then to advertising
o-o
and marketing.
o-o
Then finally to
o-o
banking, insurance,
o-o
legal services,
o-o
real estate developers,
o-o
logging, mining,
o-o
casinos,
o-o
alcohol
o-o
businesses,
o-o
and the
o-o
tobacco
o-o
industry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I love it!
o-o
Especially because
o-o
sleazy
o-o
real estate
o-o
developers
o-o
would be at the bottom
o-o
paying the highest
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
Now it's finally
o-o
so much clearer
o-o
who I should fight!
o-o
And how I can fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you're saying
o-o
that better
o-o
voting methods
o-o
would allow us
o-o
voters to elect
o-o
politicians
o-o
who'd pass laws
o-o
that change business
o-o
taxes?
o-o
In ways that
o-o
would lead to
o-o
a stronger
o-o
economy?
o-o
So there's
o-o
a big flow of
o-o
money into the
o-o
United States?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And higher taxes
o-o
for businesses
o-o
that mostly earn
o-o
their money from
o-o
local customers?
o-o
Like law firms,
o-o
Wall Street banks,
o-o
insurance
o-o
companies,
and
real-estate
o-o
developers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I'm not saying
o-o
what should be done,
o-o
or will be done.
o-o
I'm saying that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
would increase
o-o
if those changes
o-o
were made.
o-o
It would make
o-o
the cherry pie
o-o
so much
o-o
bigger!
o-o
Then everyone
o-o
can get
o-o
a bigger
o-o
slice.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N it would only
o-o
decrease
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for a few people
o-o
who earn their money
o-o
by owning
o-o
taker businesses?
o-o
That sounds great!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm ready for this fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And it would
o-o
decrease
o-o
prosperity
o-o
in Russia,
o-o
China,
o-o
and
o-o
North Korea,
o-o
where
o-o
corrupt
o-o
dictators
o-o
undermine
o-o
efficiency.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey! I see a pattern.
o-o
The owners of
o-o
taker businesses
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
o-o
'N currently
o-o
their businesses
o-o
get so many tax breaks
o-o
they pay low
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
'N the owners
o-o
of maker businesses,
o-o
like the one
o-o
I work in,
o-o
'n the one
o-o
I'd like to build,
o-o
they're in the
o-o
political up.
o-o
Yet they pay high
o-o
tax rates.
o-o
'N get
o-o
few tax breaks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Hey!
o-o
The economy's
o-o
like a bat
o-o
takin' a nap.
o-o
It's upside down!
o-o
We're taxin' the
o-o
fruitful makers
o-o
more than the
o-o
vulture takers!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Alas, yes,
o-o
in some ways
o-o
the economic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see something
o-o
else!
o-o
Suppose law
o-o
offices
o-o
were taxed more.
o-o
Then lawyers
o-o
would earn less
o-o
than they do now.
o-o
That means some smart
o-o
pre hyphen-here law students
o-o
would abandon
o-o
their path to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs as lawyers,
o-o
and instead choose
o-o
career paths
o-o
that lead to
o-o
maker
o-o
businesses,
o-o
where their
o-o
salaries would be
o-o
better than now
o-o
because maker
o-o
businesses
o-o
would be taxed less.
o-o
That job migration
o-o
would use U.S.
o-o
brainpower
o-o
more efficiently,
o-o
for better
o-o
widespread
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the same thing
o-o
would happen with
o-o
people being
o-o
less attracted
o-o
to soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs on Wall Street.
o-o
But wait a
o-o
minute.
o-o
...
o-o
I think that might
o-o
mean a lower
o-o
salary for me
o-o
'cause I'm not
o-o
a smart guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Does this guy
o-o
really not know how
o-o
smart he is?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He hasn't done
o-o
much reading so
o-o
he's not book smart.
o-o
But he's very smart
o-o
in common sense.
o-o
Which is all too
o-o
uncommon,
o-o
alas.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I'm so smart,
o-o
why'd I flunk
o-o
out of community
o-o
college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because you've got
o-o
a reading
o-o
disability
o-o
that schools
o-o
don't test for.
o-o
That makes schools
o-o
stupid.
o-o
Not you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My world's
o-o
so upside down.
o-o
In so many ways.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's fix that.
o-o
What's still
o-o
confusing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I keep hearing
o-o
the economy's
o-o
on the climbing
o-o
path of a
o-o
roller coaster.
o-o
But I'm in
o-o
one of the cars
o-o
that's derailed,
o-o
and I'm
o-o
plunging
o-o
fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The stock market
o-o
keeps going up and up
o-o
because people
o-o
with money have
o-o
few other places
o-o
to invest it.
o-o
Specifically
o-o
certificates
o-o
of deposit
o-o
haven't been
o-o
yielding much
o-o
interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I suppose
o-o
that gives
o-o
the stock market
o-o
sort of a
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So stocks are
o-o
like an
o-o
over-inflated
o-o
balloon.
o-o
Does that mean our
o-o
roller coaster
o-o
ride will soon
o-o
plummet?
o-o
And the poor
o-o
will all die?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's difficult
o-o
to predict when
o-o
it will drop
o-o
from its
o-o
recent
o-o
top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You said
o-o
economists
o-o
predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Knowing begin-italics what end-italics will
o-o
happen is
o-o
different
o-o
from knowing begin-italics when end-italics
o-o
those whats will
o-o
happen.
o-o
Professors
o-o
of economics
o-o
focus on
o-o
rational
o-o
behavior.
o-o
But successful
o-o
investors earn
o-o
lots of money
o-o
by knowing the
o-o
stock market
o-o
can stay
o-o
irrational
o-o
longer than
o-o
investors
o-o
can stay
o-o
solvent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah.
o-o
Economists
o-o
assume people
o-o
are smart.
o-o
This explains why
o-o
they,
o-o
and you,
o-o
probably
o-o
aren't wealthy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Our math proofs
o-o
do have
o-o
some goofs.
o-o
After all,
o-o
measuring
o-o
stupidity
o-o
is tricky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of
o-o
morons,
o-o
why doesn't
o-o
the economy
o-o
work for
o-o
hard workers
o-o
like me?
o-o
The numbers lie.
o-o
They say
o-o
everything's
o-o
hunky dory.
o-o
Is this an example
o-o
of mathiness?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I don't know what
o-o
mathiness is.
o-o
But numbers can
o-o
be deceptive.
o-o
What many people
o-o
overlook is that
o-o
the unemployment
o-o
rate that's in the news
o-o
just counts people
o-o
who are now getting
o-o
unemployment
o-o
benefits.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Those benefits
o-o
run out after a
o-o
few months of having
o-o
no job. I've learned
o-o
that from
o-o
experience.
o-o
So unemployment
o-o
is actually higher,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, it's higher.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why don't economists
o-o
measure that?
o-o
The real unemployment
o-o
rate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The government
o-o
does measure that
o-o
as well.
o-o
But most
o-o
newspapers and
o-o
TV stations
o-o
report the
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate
o-o
that
o-o
government
o-o
officials call
o-o
attention to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since wealthy
o-o
business owners
o-o
own news sources,
o-o
they probably
o-o
tell their
o-o
reporters
o-o
to report the
o-o
lower rate.
o-o
That gives
o-o
consumers
o-o
the confidence
o-o
to spend dollars
o-o
more freely.
o-o
And that gives
o-o
the wealthy
o-o
more sales,
o-o
more money.

I thought it was
o-o
just the
o-o
government
o-o
being sneaky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's both.
o-o
The government
o-o
knows that if they
o-o
call attention
o-o
to the higher
o-o
unemployment rate,
o-o
then consumers
o-o
will have less
o-o
optimism.
o-o
And when there's
o-o
less optimism
o-o
consumers
o-o
spend less money,
o-o
and that loops
o-o
back through
o-o
businesses
o-o
to fewer jobs
o-o
and lower
o-o
salaries
o-o
for other
o-o
employees,
o-o
who then spend
o-o
less money.
o-o
That's a powerful
o-o
feedback loop.

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought
o-o
a feedback loop
o-o
was the name for
o-o
going back
o-o
for seconds
o-o
and thirds
o-o
at an
o-o
all hyphen-here you hyphen-here can hyphen-here eat
o-o
buffet.

A feedback loop
o-o
is what makes
o-o
a hurricane
o-o
so powerful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
so economics
o-o
is like politics
o-o
and hurricanes.
o-o
It involves
o-o
lots of hot air.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No,
o-o
you airhead!
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
is when a cause
o-o
and effect
o-o
becomes
o-o
a circle.
o-o
The first effect
o-o
becomes a
o-o
second cause,
o-o
and the
o-o
second effect
o-o
becomes the
o-o
first cause.

So this loop
o-o
between optimism
o-o
and consumption
o-o
is like
o-o
your poop
o-o
scooper loop?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a different
o-o
kind of
o-o
feedback loop.
o-o
Dog owners
o-o
have to care
o-o
about the health
o-o
of other dogs
o-o
to protect
o-o
their own dog's
o-o
health.
o-o
Here, in
o-o
economic
o-o
kinds of
o-o
feedback loops,
o-o
monetary ...
o-o
money hyphen-here based
o-o
begin-italics self hyphen-here interest end-italics
o-o
is the
o-o
motivation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In economic
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
each person
o-o
focuses on
o-o
what they
o-o
themselves
o-o
want,
o-o
without caring
o-o
about what
o-o
others want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
o-o
Dog owners,
o-o
the pooper
o-o
scooper ones,
o-o
care how many
o-o
piles of dog poop
o-o
their dog
o-o
can sniff.
o-o
But that's
o-o
affected by
o-o
other dog
o-o
owners.
o-o
There's no
o-o
benefit
o-o
to poop
o-o
scooping
o-o
if other
o-o
dog owners
o-o
don't scoop
o-o
too.

ambee sings-desha amenn
You've got it.

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hey!
o-o
...
o-o
Wait a moment.
o-o
...
o-o
Feedback loops
o-o
are what rich
o-o
business owners
o-o
use to get
o-o
oversized slices
o-o
of economic pie!
o-o
They use lawyers.
o-o
And they control
o-o
news sources.
o-o
And they use money
o-o
to exploit
o-o
elections
o-o
in ways that
o-o
control
o-o
politicians.
o-o
They use
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to give themselves
o-o
bigger
o-o
and bigger
o-o
slices of
o-o
cherry pie.
o-o
And they don't
o-o
give a damn
o-o
about other
o-o
people
o-o
suffering.
o-o
No wonder
o-o
I'm hungry,
o-o
economically.
