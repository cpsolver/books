o-o
This is name-damien no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof-firstuse amenn
Welcome name-desha
o-o
and name-damien no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Welcome to
o-o
my classroom.
sentence-next
o-o
As we get settled
o-o
I'll ask you
o-o
name-damien no-space ,
o-o
do you like
o-o
pi?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien-firstuse amenn
I'll keep things real.
sentence-next
o-o
In the morning
o-o
pie seems so
o-o
irrational.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So you do like math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Already I'm confused.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He doesn't know
o-o
about those
o-o
special meanings
o-o
for pi and
o-o
irrational,
o-o
and real,
o-o
in the
o-o
math world.
sentence-next
o-o
Just assume
o-o
he knows
o-o
as much
o-o
about math
o-o
as Mozart
o-o
knew about
o-o
...
o-o
electronics.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus he has
o-o
a phobia
o-o
about
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
That's
o-o
name-damien no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
I don't know
o-o
if Mozart
o-o
had that fear.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Classrooms
o-o
are scary,
o-o
spooky, 'n
o-o
terrifyin'.
sentence-next
o-o
This one's bringin'
o-o
back awful
o-o
memories
o-o
of bein' teased
o-o
for gettin' Cs,
o-o
'n Ds,
o-o
'specially
o-o
in math 'n
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I bet you're smart.
sentence-next
o-o
You just didn't
o-o
get a good start.
sentence-next
o-o
Can you count?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
One two three four
o-o
'n of course there's more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Can you go
o-o
the other way?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Four three two one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What comes after
o-o
one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Nothin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a way you're
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
bein' polite
o-o
in sayin' I'm wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What's nothing called
o-o
in math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah yes, wonderful
o-o
magical zero!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's so special
o-o
'bout zero?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Without the
o-o
digit zero,
o-o
scientists
o-o
and engineers
o-o
couldn't have put
o-o
a man on the moon,
o-o
or put rovers
o-o
on the
o-o
planet Mars.
sentence-next
o-o
And imagine
o-o
the alternative,
o-o
using Roman
o-o
numerals.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yikes!
sentence-next
o-o
Reporting
o-o
election results
o-o
with Roman
o-o
numerals
o-o
would lead to
o-o
cross hyphen-here country
o-o
hair loss.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And an
o-o
anti hyphen-here math
o-o
cult.
sentence-next
o-o
Which I would
o-o
have joined
o-o
before today.
sentence-next
o-o
But now I
o-o
recognize
o-o
that zero's
o-o
a big hyphen-here deal number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Not just zero.
sentence-next
o-o
The digit zero.
sentence-next
o-o
There have always
o-o
been words like
o-o
none, empty,
o-o
nobody,
o-o
vacant,
o-o
zilch, naked,
o-o
hungry, and
o-o
moron.
sentence-next
o-o
But writing
o-o
four zero
o-o
instead of
o-o
X X X X,
o-o
that's magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the digit zero's
o-o
a big deal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Without it
o-o
bridges would
o-o
be filled with
o-o
long lines of
o-o
accountants
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
waiting for
o-o
their turn to
o-o
jump off.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Even better,
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
eliminates
o-o
the use of
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How so?
sentence-next
o-o
I've gotta
o-o
use fractions
o-o
every day.
sentence-next
o-o
It makes me
o-o
wacko to
o-o
add 'n subtract
o-o
those
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
suckers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If fractions you
o-o
loathe, then this
o-o
question I pose.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do you use them?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's part of
o-o
my job.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Are you a musician?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's music
o-o
got to do with
o-o
fractions?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Musicians
o-o
cannot avoid
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
They count
o-o
by two, or three,
o-o
or four, or six,
o-o
or eight.
sentence-next
o-o
But not by
o-o
five or ten.
sentence-next
o-o
Except,
o-o
I suspect,
o-o
for some
o-o
geeky
o-o
modern
o-o
jazz.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now we know
o-o
Mozart wasn't
o-o
fraction
o-o
phobic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I build custom
o-o
staircases.
sentence-next
o-o
Tape measures
o-o
are marked in
o-o
halves, quarters,
o-o
eighths, 'n
o-o
sixteenths.
sentence-next
o-o
Those effin'
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
I'd murder
o-o
those suckers
o-o
if I knew
o-o
where to aim.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use decimal
o-o
numbers.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what the
o-o
rest of the world
o-o
uses as part of
o-o
the metric system.
sentence-next
o-o
Except of course
o-o
here in the states.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can't use
o-o
metric units.
sentence-next
o-o
That'd get
o-o
me fired.
sentence-next
o-o
Inches and feet
o-o
are required.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Decimal
o-o
numbers work
o-o
with inches too.
sentence-next
o-o
Just get a
o-o
tape measure with
o-o
decimal
o-o
markings for
o-o
inches.
sentence-next
o-o
Here, look at this
o-o
tape measure.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, it's marked
o-o
with ten units
o-o
per inch!
sentence-next
o-o
When I measure
o-o
I could write the
o-o
numbers as tenths
o-o
or hundredths.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And adding and
o-o
subtracting them
o-o
is as easy as
o-o
dollars and cents.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This will
o-o
elevate
o-o
my joy when
o-o
making
o-o
staircases.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A fraction
o-o
is just a
o-o
division
o-o
problem
o-o
unfinished.
sentence-next
o-o
It's waiting
o-o
to get
o-o
diminished
o-o
to a single
o-o
number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How do I get
o-o
a tape measure
o-o
like this?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use the magic
o-o
math word
o-o
begin-italics decimal end-italics
o-o
when you search for
o-o
begin-italics tape measure end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
math words can be
o-o
powerful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're not alone
o-o
in fearing
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
Ancient Romans
o-o
had that fear,
o-o
even though they
o-o
fearlessly
o-o
conquered most
o-o
Mediterranean
o-o
waterfront
o-o
property.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why they
o-o
used twelve marks
o-o
to measure
o-o
daylight hours
o-o
on a sundial.
sentence-next
o-o
The number twelve
o-o
can be divided
o-o
by two and three
o-o
and four and six,
o-o
and yield a nice
o-o
result of
o-o
six or four or
o-o
three or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
that's why we have
o-o
twenty four hours
o-o
in a day!
sentence-next
o-o
I had wondered
o-o
why time is
o-o
measured
o-o
in numbers that
o-o
aren't,
o-o
uh,
o-o
decimal.
