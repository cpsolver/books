Hi
o-o
name-mathprof no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
This is name-damien no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof-firstuse amenn
Welcome name-desha
o-o
and name-damien no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
Welcome to
o-o
my classroom.
sentence-next
o-o
As we get settled
o-o
I'll ask you
o-o
name-damien no-space ,
o-o
do you like
o-o
pi?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien-firstuse amenn
I'll keep things real.
sentence-next
o-o
In the morning
o-o
pie seems so
o-o
irrational.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So you do like math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Already I'm confused.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He doesn't know
o-o
about those
o-o
special meanings
o-o
for pi and
o-o
irrational,
o-o
and real,
o-o
in the
o-o
math world.
sentence-next
o-o
Just assume
o-o
he knows
o-o
as much
o-o
about math
o-o
as Mozart
o-o
knew about
o-o
...
o-o
electronics.
sentence-next
o-o
Plus he has
o-o
a phobia
o-o
about
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
That's
o-o
name-damien no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
I don't know
o-o
if Mozart
o-o
had that fear.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Classrooms
o-o
are scary,
o-o
spooky, 'n
o-o
terrifyin'.
sentence-next
o-o
This one's bringin'
o-o
back awful
o-o
memories
o-o
of bein' teased
o-o
for gettin' Cs,
o-o
'n Ds,
o-o
'specially
o-o
in math 'n
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I bet you're smart.
sentence-next
o-o
You just didn't
o-o
get a good start.
sentence-next
o-o
Can you count?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
One two three four
o-o
'n of course there's more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Can you go
o-o
the other way?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Four three two one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What comes after
o-o
one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Nothin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a way you're
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
bein' polite
o-o
in sayin' I'm wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What's nothing called
o-o
in math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah yes, wonderful
o-o
magical zero!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's so special
o-o
'bout zero?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Zero as a digit
o-o
was not known in
o-o
ancient Egypt,
o-o
Babylon, Greece,
o-o
and Rome.
sentence-next
o-o
But in ancient
o-o
China they put
o-o
their counting marks
o-o
inside a square.
sentence-next
o-o
So when no marks
o-o
are there,
o-o
it's an empty
o-o
square.
sentence-next
o-o
That changed to
o-o
a circle as
o-o
the idea spread
o-o
to India then
o-o
Arabic-speaking
o-o
universities.
sentence-next
o-o
And then a student
o-o
took it to Rome
o-o
and became pope.
sentence-next
o-o

combee ************
Pope Sylvestor II aka Gerbert of Aurillac brought decimal notation and calculation procedures to Europe, and he became pope in year 999.
************ comenn

He could
o-o
calculate
o-o
faster than the
o-o
Italians who
o-o
still used
o-o
counting marks,
o-o
the ones we call
o-o
Roman numerals.
sentence-next
o-o
That's how the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
became part
o-o
of the Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's when
o-o
Leonardo
o-o
painted the
o-o
Mona Lisa,
o-o
and Michelangelo
o-o
carved the
o-o
rock hyphen-here hard
o-o
anatomy of
o-o
David.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lisa and David.
sentence-next
o-o
I think I've
o-o
heard about
o-o
those two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With that
o-o
digit zero,
o-o
Portuguese
o-o
sailors made
o-o
realistic maps,
o-o
and navigated
o-o
far out into
o-o
the Atlantic.
sentence-next
o-o
They bumped into
o-o
Brazil,
o-o
where they restocked
o-o
with food and water,
o-o
then sailed
o-o
around the
o-o
southern tip
o-o
of Africa.
sentence-next
o-o
That bypassed
o-o
the north hyphen-here bound winds
o-o
along the
o-o
southwest
o-o
coast of
o-o
Africa.
sentence-next
o-o
And it
o-o
bypassed the
o-o
monopoly that
o-o
Arabic-speaking
o-o
Muslims had
o-o
on the land hyphen-here based
o-o
silk road to China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So it was
o-o
the digit zero,
o-o
not Columbus,
o-o
that got us
o-o
to North
o-o
and South
o-o
America?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes, in fact,
o-o
the Portuguese
o-o
discovered
o-o
Brazil before
o-o
fourteen ninety two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, so that's why
o-o
people in Brazil
o-o
speak Portuguese
o-o
instead of Spanish.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Interesting!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, zero's
o-o
a big hyphen-here deal number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The digit zero.
sentence-next
o-o
Not just zero.
sentence-next
o-o
There have always
o-o
been words like
o-o
none, empty,
o-o
nobody,
o-o
zilch, naked,
o-o
hungry, and
o-o
moron.
sentence-next
o-o
But writing
o-o
four zero zero
o-o
instead of
o-o
C C C C,
o-o
that's magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the digit zero's
o-o
a big deal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Without it
o-o
bridges would
o-o
be filled with
o-o
long lines of
o-o
accountants
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
waiting for
o-o
their turn to
o-o
jump off.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Without it,
o-o
scientists
o-o
and engineers
o-o
couldn't have put
o-o
a man on the moon,
o-o
or put rovers
o-o
on the
o-o
planet Mars,
o-o
or photographed
o-o
the rings of Saturn
o-o
from within
o-o
those rings.
sentence-next
o-o
And those are just
o-o
a few of the things
o-o
that make
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
so incredibly
o-o
fantastic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think my
o-o
confusions
o-o
'bout zero
o-o
are gone.
sentence-next
o-o
But how's that
o-o
relate to
o-o
what happens
o-o
in gettin' fair
o-o
elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's something
o-o
in math that's
o-o
still very new.
sentence-next
o-o
It's not yet taught
o-o
in public schools.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet it can take
o-o
civilization,
o-o
humanity,
o-o
us,
o-o
to the next level
o-o
where elections
o-o
are fair.
sentence-next
o-o
But to get there
o-o
you need to
o-o
appreciate
o-o
the power of a
o-o
name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, what's the name?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A name without
o-o
it's meaning is
o-o
useless.
sentence-next
o-o
Concepts come first.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Every test I took
o-o
cared more about
o-o
the names than the
o-o
concepts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I learned to spell
o-o
begin-italics hypotenuse end-italics
o-o
before I learned
o-o
it had nothing
o-o
to do with
o-o
hippos.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's because names
o-o
and dates and such
o-o
are easier to test.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't that upside
o-o
down? Testin'
o-o
what's less
o-o
important?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You seem to me
o-o
to be quite
o-o
intelligent.
sentence-next
o-o
So let's
o-o
eliminate
o-o
your fear of
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there a
o-o
rattlesnake
o-o
cage or
o-o
fallin' tree
o-o
nearby?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
also disliked
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
And so did
o-o
the Romans.
sentence-next
o-o
It's because
o-o
they lacked the
o-o
digit zero.
sentence-next
o-o
That's no big deal
o-o
for addition
o-o
and subtraction
o-o
and multiplication.
sentence-next
o-o
Those are just
o-o
shortcuts for
o-o
counting up,
o-o
counting down,
o-o
and a skipping
o-o
version of
o-o
counting up.
sentence-next
o-o
But division,
o-o
without the
o-o
big hyphen-here deal zero,
o-o
that's muddled and
o-o
befuddled
o-o
confusion.
sentence-next
o-o
So leaving
o-o
numbers as
o-o
fractions,
o-o
without doing the
o-o
division it
o-o
signifies,
o-o
that's what they did
o-o
until the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
arrived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now we've got
o-o
zero,
o-o
the digit.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I've gotta
o-o
use fractions
o-o
every day.
sentence-next
o-o
It makes me
o-o
wacko to
o-o
add 'n subtract
o-o
those
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
suckers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If fractions you
o-o
loathe, then this
o-o
question I pose.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do you use them?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's part of
o-o
my job.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Are you a musician?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's music
o-o
got to do with
o-o
fractions?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Musicians
o-o
cannot avoid
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
They count
o-o
by two, or three,
o-o
or four, or six,
o-o
or eight.
sentence-next
o-o
But not by
o-o
five or ten.
sentence-next
o-o
Except,
o-o
I suspect,
o-o
for some
o-o
geeky
o-o
modern
o-o
jazz.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now we know
o-o
Mozart wasn't
o-o
fraction
o-o
phobic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I build custom
o-o
staircases.
sentence-next
o-o
Tape measures
o-o
are marked in
o-o
halves, quarters,
o-o
eighths, 'n
o-o
sixteenths.
sentence-next
o-o
Those effin'
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
I'd murder
o-o
those suckers
o-o
if I knew
o-o
where to aim.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use decimal numbers.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what the whole
o-o
world uses, as part of
o-o
the metric system.
sentence-next
o-o
Except of course
o-o
here in the states.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can't use
o-o
metric units.
sentence-next
o-o
That'd get
o-o
me fired.
sentence-next
o-o
Inches and feet
o-o
are required.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Decimal
o-o
numbers work
o-o
with inches too.
sentence-next
o-o
Just get a
o-o
tape measure with
o-o
decimal
o-o
markings for
o-o
inches!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, if only
o-o
I could do so.
sentence-next
o-o
That'd be great!
sentence-next
o-o
I could avoid
o-o
the fractions
o-o
I hate!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here, look at this
o-o
tape measure.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, it's marked
o-o
with ten units
o-o
per inch!
sentence-next
o-o
When I measure
o-o
I could write the
o-o
numbers as tenths
o-o
or hundredths.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And adding and
o-o
subtracting them
o-o
is as easy as
o-o
dollars and cents.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This will
o-o
elevate
o-o
my joy when
o-o
making
o-o
staircases.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So a fraction
o-o
is a
o-o
division
o-o
problem
o-o
unfinished.
sentence-next
o-o
It's waiting
o-o
to get
o-o
diminished
o-o
to a single
o-o
number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How do I get
o-o
a tape measure
o-o
like this?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use the magic
o-o
math word
o-o
begin-italics decimal end-italics
o-o
when you search for
o-o
begin-italics tape measure end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
words can be
o-o
powerful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You learn fast!
sentence-next
o-o
Now about your
o-o
fear of
o-o
fractions.
sentence-next
o-o
Ancient Romans,
o-o
even though they
o-o
fearlessly
o-o
conquered most
o-o
Mediterranean
o-o
waterfront
o-o
property,
o-o
they too had
o-o
that fear.
sentence-next
o-o
They liked the
o-o
number twelve.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why sundials
o-o
have twelve marks
o-o
for the
o-o
daylight hours.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So that's why we have
o-o
twenty four hours
o-o
per day?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
The number twelve
o-o
can be divided
o-o
by two and three
o-o
and four and six,
o-o
and yield a nice
o-o
result of
o-o
six or four or
o-o
three or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wondered why
o-o
time is measured
o-o
in numbers that
o-o
aren't in
o-o
multiples
o-o
of ten.
end-lyric
