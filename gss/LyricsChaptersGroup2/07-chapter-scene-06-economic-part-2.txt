This talk of
o-o
selfishness
o-o
and economic
o-o
depression
o-o
is
o-o
depressing and
o-o
discouraging.
o-o
I need some
o-o
optimism.
o-o
Is there even
o-o
any hope the big
o-o
problems we face
o-o
can be solved?
o-o
Like global
o-o
climate change?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back when horses
o-o
pulled wagons,
o-o
big cities faced
o-o
a big environmental
o-o
dilemma.
o-o
They predicted
o-o
that soon cities
o-o
would be knee high
o-o
in horse shit.
o-o
Yet that didn't
o-o
happen.
o-o
Not one bit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They failed
o-o
to predict
o-o
automobiles
o-o
would take over.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So our current
o-o
climate crisis
o-o
is like being
o-o
ankle hyphen-here deep in
o-o
horse shit?
o-o
Except it's
o-o
invisible?
o-o
This is
o-o
optimistic?
o-o
I was hoping
o-o
to see a future
o-o
so bright
o-o
I'll need to wear
o-o
sunglasses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You've mentioned
o-o
low salaries.
o-o
Those would rise
o-o
if businesses
o-o
were given
o-o
a well hyphen-here designed
o-o
tax break.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What would that
o-o
look like?
o-o
How would it work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A business
o-o
would get
o-o
a tax credit
o-o
if their gap
o-o
between
o-o
executives
o-o
and workers
o-o
is lower
o-o
than other
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would
o-o
reduce the need
o-o
for labor strikes,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed it would.
o-o
Of course it has
o-o
no chance
o-o
of getting passed
o-o
under our current
o-o
election system.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's the kind of
o-o
bright future
o-o
I'd like to see!
o-o
Is there a way
o-o
to measure
o-o
that gap?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sure,
o-o
just average
o-o
the salaries
o-o
below the median,
o-o
and the salaries
o-o
above the median,
o-o
subtract them,
o-o
and divide by the
o-o
minimum wage.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-italics Median end-lyric no-space ?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's just the
o-o
half hyphen-here way
o-o
salary.
o-o
So he's saying
o-o
to split the employees
o-o
into two groups
o-o
of equal size.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That gives
o-o
a wage hyphen-here gap
o-o
index number.
o-o
The smaller
o-o
the number,
o-o
the bigger
o-o
the tax break.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brilliant!
o-o
name-desha
o-o
you can put on those
o-o
sunglasses now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You're right.
o-o
That would be
o-o
a very bright
o-o
way to force,
o-o
well motivate,
o-o
business owners
o-o
to share
o-o
more of their
o-o
profits
o-o
with their
o-o
employees.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What other
o-o
predictions
o-o
are we failing
o-o
to see?
o-o
What
o-o
solutions
o-o
can solve
o-o
our huge
o-o
crises?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If you're right,
o-o
perhaps
o-o
the biggest
o-o
overlooked
o-o
solution
o-o
is pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
That could end
o-o
the big bad
o-o
feedback
o-o
loop,
o-o
if it's done right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So better
o-o
vote counting
o-o
could increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
o-o
Got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What other
o-o
solutions
o-o
are waiting
o-o
for a
o-o
revolution?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I've read
o-o
about fully

o-o
thorium
o-o
nuclear
o-o

o-o
a fully

o-o
that will reduce

o-o
new programming
o-o

o-o
that will

o-o
Plus I've got
o-o
a personal
o-o
guess.
o-o
There will be
o-o
better
o-o
micropayment
o-o
systems that help
o-o
individual

entrepreneurs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
o-o
It makes my

gutter cleaning
o-o
tool seem
o-o
smaller than
o-o
a bikini
o-o
on a beach
o-o
in Rio.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
How do you know
o-o
about these things?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I've seen some
o-o
movies about
o-o
...
o-o
oh.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I read.
o-o
It's a form of
o-o
time travel.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I read too,
o-o
but this is all
o-o
news to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I mostly read
o-o
non hyphen-here fiction.
o-o
I skip over
o-o
articles that
o-o
are judgements,
o-o
such as who's to blame,
o-o
or what begin-italics should end-italics be done,
o-o
or what celebrities
o-o
are promoting.
o-o
Instead I like
o-o
to read about
o-o
why things are
o-o
the way they are,
o-o
which includes
o-o
lots of
o-o
history.
o-o
And when there's
o-o
a claim for a
o-o
solution,
o-o
I just focus
o-o
on its
o-o
advantages
o-o
and
o-o
disadvantages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what's blocking
o-o
those future
o-o
solutions from
o-o
happening?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Let me guess.
o-o
Feedback loops are
o-o
keeping those things
o-o
from getting
o-o
developed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus again!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So there's lots
o-o
of feedback loops
o-o
blocking progress.
o-o
What's the
o-o
feedback loop
o-o
that blocks us
o-o
from election
o-o
reform?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are many.
o-o
As you've discovered,
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is just one part
o-o
of a feedback loop
o-o
that keeps owners
o-o
of many big
o-o
businesses
o-o
in political power.
o-o
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I think I see.
o-o
It's vote
o-o
splitting
o-o
in general
o-o
elections
o-o
that causes
o-o
political
o-o
parties
o-o
to only offer
o-o
one nominee
o-o
in each party.
o-o
And having
o-o
just one
o-o
nominee
o-o
per party
o-o
allows
o-o
the blocking tactic,
o-o
like when
o-o
Republicans
o-o
blocked
o-o
Hillary
o-o
Clinton
o-o
from reaching
o-o
the 2008
o-o
presidential
o-o
election.
o-o
And vote
o-o
splitting
o-o
in primary
o-o
elections
o-o
allows money
o-o
to control
o-o
who wins
o-o
the party's
o-o
nomination.
o-o
And it blocks
o-o
third parties
o-o
from getting
o-o
meaningful support.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, ...
o-o
that's what
o-o
allows
o-o
corrupt
o-o
business owners
o-o
to limit
o-o
our choice to
o-o
one Republican
o-o
puppet
o-o
and one
o-o
Democratic
o-o
puppet
o-o
in our
o-o
general
o-o
elections.
o-o
So it's that
o-o
feedback loop
o-o
that's our
o-o
evil
o-o
enemy.
o-o
And why Congress
o-o
has become
o-o
a circus
o-o
full of clowns.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That sounds like
o-o
a good
o-o
summary
o-o
to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So what do those
o-o
corrupt
o-o
business
o-o
owners
o-o
oppose?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They oppose
o-o
innovations
o-o
they fear
o-o
will reduce
o-o
their income.
o-o
Such as
o-o
owners of
o-o
Exxon shares
o-o
opposing
o-o
fully
o-o
synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon
o-o
fuel.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's synthetic
o-o
whatever?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
o-o
refers to gases
o-o
and liquids that
o-o
are chemically
o-o
manufactured
o-o
for use as
o-o
fuel.
o-o
The process
o-o
would use sunlight
o-o
as the
o-o
energy source.
o-o
It would get
o-o
carbon from
o-o
carbon dioxide
o-o
in the atmosphere ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which we have too much of.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
... and it would get 
o-o
hydrogen
o-o
from water.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So doing what plants do?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, but much more
o-o
efficiently.
o-o
Especially
o-o
compared to
o-o
using crops to
o-o
generate ethanol,
o-o
which involves
o-o
a few wealthy
o-o
people who
o-o
have a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
on ethanol.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If synthetic hydro ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Fully synthetic
o-o
hydrocarbon fuel
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
... is such a good thing,
o-o
what's blocking that
o-o
from happening?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There's no
o-o
economic
o-o
incentive.
o-o
The people who
o-o
have the skills
o-o
to figure it out
o-o
cannot get paid
o-o
to do that
o-o
research.
o-o
And oil
o-o
companies
o-o
can earn more
o-o
money by
o-o
blocking that
o-o
research.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, more
o-o
feedback loops.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Instead it's
o-o
the lack of a
o-o
feedback loop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there something
o-o
from history that
o-o
would reveal
o-o
how to make
o-o
good changes
o-o
happen sooner?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
When Kodak tried to
o-o
develop, so to speak,
o-o
color film for cameras,
o-o
their research labs
o-o
were only making slow
o-o
progress.
o-o
But two young
o-o
chemistry graduates
o-o
were making better
o-o
progress, so Kodak
o-o
hired them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What was the secret
o-o
that gave them an
o-o
advantage?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They were singers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The secret was singing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
At that time
o-o
color darkrooms
o-o
were completely dark,
o-o
so there was no way
o-o
to see a timer.
o-o
Yet the chemistry
o-o
was very time hyphen-here critical.
o-o
So they sang songs together
o-o
and used the timing of songs
o-o
as their timer
o-o
for chemical reactions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're saying
o-o
we need to
o-o
take up singing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It illustrates
o-o
that breakthroughs
o-o
often require
o-o
sub hyphen-here breakthroughs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So this means we
o-o
need to figure out
o-o
some kind of
o-o
innovation
o-o
that will help spread
o-o
the bigger
o-o
innovation
o-o
of fairer voting
o-o
methods?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
Look for a way
o-o
to break the
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
that block fairer
o-o
voting.
o-o
Drill a hole through
o-o
the dam that
o-o
holds back
o-o
the flood of
o-o
fairness and
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
that
o-o
civilization
o-o
is waiting for.
o-o
Then voters
o-o
can elect
o-o
leaders who will
o-o
be begin-italics their end-italics puppets.
o-o
Until then
o-o
politicians
o-o
are the puppets
o-o
of what you call
o-o
the political down.
o-o
Many of them
o-o
earn their money
o-o
in ways
o-o
that've become
o-o
obsolete.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Any more tips?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
One way to fight
o-o
against bad
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
is to create
o-o
opposing
o-o
good feedback loops.
o-o
Especially
o-o
ones that increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I need an
o-o
example
o-o
again.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Democracy
o-o
itself is a
o-o
feedback loop.
o-o
It yields
o-o
far better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
compared to
o-o
monarchy and
o-o
dictatorship.
o-o
That makes
o-o
oppressed people
o-o
jealous.
o-o
That jealousy
o-o
brought down the
o-o
Berlin wall,
o-o
toppled the
o-o
dictators in
o-o
eastern Europe,
o-o
and ended
o-o
the Cold War
o-o
against the
o-o
Soviet
o-o
Union.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow!
o-o
Jealousy
o-o
isn't always
o-o
a bad thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Feedback loops
o-o
are not always
o-o
bad?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Good and bad
o-o
are just shortcut
o-o
ways to say
o-o
something
o-o
has lots of
o-o
advantages
o-o
or lots of
o-o
disadvantages.
o-o
But it depends
o-o
on who you are
o-o
as to whether
o-o
a change is an
o-o
advantage
o-o
or disadvantage.
o-o
A feedback loop
o-o
that helps big
o-o
businesses
o-o
get richer
o-o
is good for
o-o
business owners
o-o
but bad for
o-o
their customers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And bad
o-o
for their
o-o
employees.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, this is the
o-o
cherry pie
o-o
slicing
o-o
concept.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And a feedback
o-o
loop can be
o-o
both good and bad
o-o
for the same
o-o
person.
o-o
It's like when
o-o
Henry Ford
o-o
paid his workers
o-o
higher than
o-o
usual salaries.
o-o
That increased
o-o
his labor costs,
o-o
but those
o-o
employees
o-o
could then afford
o-o
to buy Ford cars,
o-o
which brought in
o-o
more profits.
o-o
And something
o-o
similar
o-o
happens when
o-o
employees
o-o
can afford
o-o
to buy shares
o-o
of stock in
o-o
the company
o-o
they work for.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So shareholders
o-o
are shooting
o-o
themselves
o-o
in the feet
o-o
by not
o-o
realizing
o-o
that the
o-o
employees
o-o
and customers
o-o
can be,
o-o
or are,
o-o
also
o-o
shareholders
o-o
of their
o-o
company.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow, so many
o-o
feedback loops
o-o
to learn about.
o-o
And yet
o-o
I've played
o-o
computer games
o-o
that took longer
o-o
to learn about
o-o
than what
o-o
I've learned
o-o
today.
o-o
About the
o-o
real hyphen-here world
o-o
economic
o-o
game.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Your insights
o-o
are amazing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But my head is full!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To help you see
o-o
how it all fits
o-o
together,
o-o
here's a thought.
o-o
Voting,
o-o
and taxes,
o-o
and subsidies,
o-o
and legal
o-o
monopolies,
o-o
and even jail time,
o-o
are all forms of
o-o
communication.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can see that
o-o
voters try to
o-o
use their ballot
o-o
to say we want
o-o
more of this,
o-o
and less of that.
o-o
Alas, it's still
o-o
at the
o-o
mumbling stage
o-o
of communication.
o-o
But taxes,
o-o
how is that
o-o
communication?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see!
o-o
It's a way
o-o
government
o-o
can use lower
o-o
taxes to say
o-o
let's have
o-o
more farming,
o-o
more stockpiled
o-o
emergency
o-o
supplies,
o-o
and more
o-o
international
o-o
sales of apps that
o-o
play stupidly
o-o
funny games
o-o
with pigs.
o-o
Higher taxes
o-o
on some
o-o
businesses
o-o
could say we need
o-o
fewer pirates
o-o
on Wall Street,
o-o
and fewer
o-o
businesses
o-o
that overpay
o-o
executives
o-o
while
o-o
underpaying
o-o
workers.
o-o
And Wall Street
o-o
executives
o-o
never going
o-o
to jail
o-o
gives the thumbs up
o-o
to financial
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, that makes sense.
o-o
Now hopefully
o-o
I can better
o-o
figure out how
o-o
to earn money
o-o
as an entrepreneur.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
To do that
o-o
you need to
o-o
understand
o-o
an important
o-o
business
o-o
concept.
o-o
So here's a test.
o-o
But don't
o-o
get stressed.
o-o
It'll
o-o
stretch
o-o
your mind.
o-o
What do these
o-o
people have
o-o
in common?
o-o
Steve Jobs,
o-o
Bill Gates,
o-o
Elon Musk,
o-o
Thomas Edison,
o-o
George Westinghouse,
o-o
and
o-o
Giovanni Marconi.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They are, or were,
o-o
rich entrepreneurs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They got rich
o-o
through tech.
o-o
Technology.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's all my brain
o-o
can guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This isn't something
o-o
I ever learned.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
They profited
o-o
from technology
o-o
that was created
o-o
by creative
o-o
geniuses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah yes.
o-o
Steve Jobs

And Apple hired
o-o
Jony Ive
o-o
who is a design
o-o
genius.

Bill Gates
o-o
co hyphen-here founded
o-o
Microsoft with
o-o
another guy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, Paul Allen.
o-o
They bought code
o-o
and renamed it
o-o
Microsoft
o-o
DOS,
o-o
so there were
o-o
creators
o-o
behind that
o-o
product.
o-o
Later there were
o-o
more creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
behind
o-o
Microsoft
o-o
Windows.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But not the
o-o
stupid ones
o-o
who put gaping
o-o
security holes
o-o
in it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Elon Musk
o-o
has hired lots
o-o
and lots of
o-o
really smart
o-o
engineers and
o-o
software coders.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And now the
o-o
trick part of
o-o
the question.
o-o
Who are the
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who created
o-o
amazing
o-o
technology
o-o
breakthroughs for
o-o
Thomas Edison,
o-o
and George
o-o
Westinghouse,
o-o
and
o-o
Giovanni
o-o
Marconi?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I only know
o-o
one of those.
o-o
Nikola Tesla.
o-o
He helped
o-o
Westinghouse
o-o
with electrical
o-o
power stuff.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Indeed,
o-o
he almost
o-o
single hyphen-here handedly
o-o
designed our
o-o
electrical
o-o
power grid system.
o-o
Yet Tesla also
o-o
invented
o-o
key parts of
o-o
radio
o-o
technology
o-o
that Marconi
o-o
commercialized.
o-o
And Tesla
o-o
also did some
o-o
inventing for
o-o
Thomas Edison.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So why doesn't
o-o
history
o-o
teach more about
o-o
people like
o-o
Tesla?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Who's got the
o-o
money it takes
o-o
to erect statues,
o-o
produce
o-o
biographic
o-o
documentaries,
o-o
and archive
o-o
the person's
o-o
scribbled
o-o
notes on
o-o
napkins?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The people
o-o
who win
o-o
economically.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who do the work
o-o
get left out.
o-o
Both from profits
o-o
and historical
o-o
recognition.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's why I said
o-o
the important
o-o
part of history
o-o
is understanding
o-o
cause and effect.
o-o
And now do you see
o-o
what you should know
o-o
about entrepreneurs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Alongside,
o-o
or behind,
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Or underneath,
o-o
getting stepped on.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK,
o-o
underneath
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
are the
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who create things
o-o
of value that
o-o
entrepreneurs
o-o
sell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
o-o
And after
o-o
creating the
o-o
innovation
o-o
that starts the
o-o
business,
o-o
those creators
o-o
need to
o-o
create yet more
o-o
innovations.
o-o
That keeps the
o-o
business
o-o
ahead of
o-o
copycat
o-o
businesses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is this like
o-o
Walt Disney?
o-o
He created
o-o
lots of
o-o
innovations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Excellent
o-o
example.
o-o
In his case his
o-o
brother Roy
o-o
handled the
o-o
money biz.
o-o
So having
o-o
a source of
o-o
great ideas
o-o
that become
o-o
innovations
o-o
can be a
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
Especially
o-o
if competing
o-o
businesses
o-o
don't have
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
working
o-o
for them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, the
o-o
ethical
o-o
kind of
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe now you can
o-o
figure out how
o-o
you can make
o-o
money from your
o-o
invention.
o-o
Maybe by teaming up
o-o
with an entrepreneur.
o-o
You would be
o-o
the creative
o-o
genius.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I could get
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It takes
o-o
lots of money
o-o
to protect
o-o
a patent.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought
o-o
getting a patent
o-o
was the hard part.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's just a start.
o-o
If it's a
o-o
valuable
o-o
idea
o-o
then other
o-o
businesses
o-o
will infringe on
o-o
your patent.
o-o
So you have to
o-o
take them to court
o-o
to protect your
o-o
monopoly.
o-o
And patent laws
o-o
favor big
o-o
corporations.
o-o
And China
o-o
mostly
o-o
ignores
o-o
patents.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sucks.
o-o
Is there a way
o-o
to ...,
o-o
I don't know,
o-o
to win in
o-o
the business
o-o
world?
o-o
For someone
o-o
like me?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The open patent
o-o
I mentioned
o-o
would help.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
If it existed
o-o
you could afford
o-o
to register
o-o
your idea with
o-o
the patent office
o-o
without mortgaging
o-o
your house to pay
o-o
for a patent
o-o
attorney.
o-o
You'd get a
o-o
patent number.
o-o
You'd add it to
o-o
your LinkedIn
o-o
profile.
o-o
Then
o-o
corporations
o-o
would compete
o-o
to hire you
o-o
to invent
o-o
yet more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
At a big salary!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That path doesn't
o-o
yet exist.
o-o
So what should
o-o
I do?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Currently
o-o
corporations
o-o
don't know how to
o-o
hire, or even
o-o
recognize,
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses.
o-o
Not until
o-o
after they've
o-o
been the
o-o
co hyphen-here founder of
o-o
a wildly
o-o
successful
o-o
start up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a very
o-o
tall wall
o-o
to climb.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, alas.
o-o
Under current
o-o
conditions
o-o
only hindsight
o-o
reveals who's
o-o
a creative
o-o
genius.
o-o
When that
o-o
inefficiency
o-o
gets solved,
o-o
that will increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
so dramatically
o-o
it will change
o-o
the economy
o-o
from a roller
o-o
coaster ride
o-o
into a rocket
o-o
ship blasting
o-o
into outer
o-o
space.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't most people
o-o
creative?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's like with art.
o-o
Thousands of
o-o
painters
o-o
have painted
o-o
portraits in
o-o
very creative
o-o
styles.
o-o
But the
o-o
Mona Lisa
o-o
stands out
o-o
as a style
o-o
that's not just
o-o
different.
o-o
It's also widely
o-o
appreciated
o-o
by millions
o-o
of people.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, that's why
o-o
you use the word
o-o
genius
o-o
after the word
o-o
creative?
o-o
'Cause the word
o-o
creative just
o-o
means different?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
alas,
o-o
most business
o-o
managers
o-o
don't understand
o-o
the different
o-o
meanings of
o-o
the word
o-o
creative.
o-o
And the word
o-o
innovation
o-o
also gets
o-o
misunderstood.
o-o
The value
o-o
of a product
o-o
or a person
o-o
becomes clear
o-o
only in hindsight,
o-o
not at the time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So solutions
o-o
are waiting
o-o
for when there's less
o-o
stupidity
o-o
in politics,
o-o
business, and
o-o
management.
o-o
That's a
o-o
zit hyphen-here sized
o-o
light
o-o
at the end of
o-o
a marathon hyphen-here long
o-o
tunnel.
o-o
Is there any hope?
o-o
For a fairer
o-o
economy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Look at history.
o-o
Civilization
o-o
has increased
o-o
efficiency
o-o
so much that
o-o
us average
o-o
folks don't waste
o-o
big parts of
o-o
our day
o-o
hauling water,
o-o
gathering firewood,
o-o
tending horses,
o-o
and pounding
o-o
underwear
o-o
against rocks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now we waste
o-o
too much time
o-o
sitting in cars,
o-o
cleaning up
o-o
after a
o-o
self hyphen-here cleaning
o-o
cat litter box
o-o
malfunctions,
o-o
and scrolling
o-o
past ads for
o-o
tee shirts
o-o
that say
o-o
begin-italics 
five out of four
o-o
people struggle
o-o
with math end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Those time wasters
o-o
and other
o-o
inefficiencies
o-o
in the economy
o-o
will disappear
o-o
after we adopt
o-o
better laws.
o-o
But that requires
o-o
increasing
o-o
the influence
o-o
of voters,
o-o
and decreasing
o-o
the influence
o-o
of money in
o-o
politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm discouraged
o-o
by the setbacks.
o-o
The ones going on
o-o
now in
o-o
politics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In the past
o-o
there've been
o-o
huge setbacks too.
o-o
Much bigger ones.
o-o
The ancient Greeks
o-o
two thousand
o-o
years ago made
o-o
clock hyphen-here like
o-o
computers
o-o
that predicted
o-o
eclipses.
o-o
One of those
o-o
was found in a
o-o
shipwreck off
o-o
the island of
o-o
Antikythera.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Who was the
o-o
creative genius
o-o
behind that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Probably either
o-o
Posidonius
o-o
or Hipparchus.
o-o
Sadly,
o-o
warfare killed
o-o
their knowledge.
o-o
Those kinds of
o-o
mechanisms
o-o
weren't
o-o
developed
o-o
again
o-o
until the
o-o
Islamic
o-o
Golden Age.
o-o
In a similar way,
o-o
the footsteps
o-o
on the moon
o-o
might remain
o-o
unmatched
o-o
for decades.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's so sad.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Especially
o-o
the loss of economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
that financed
o-o
those
o-o
rocket hyphen-here science
o-o
creative
o-o
geniuses
o-o
who built
o-o
space hyphen-here exploration
o-o
technology.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yet when times
o-o
get rough,
o-o
more people say
o-o
begin-italics
We've had enough!
end-italics
o-o
and they work
o-o
together
o-o
to make things
o-o
better.
o-o
That's where
o-o
you two are.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Solutions
o-o
are waiting.
o-o
World war three
o-o
is widely
o-o
known to be
o-o
a very stupid
o-o
idea,
o-o
for self hyphen-here interest
o-o
reasons.
o-o
So there's time
o-o
to get
o-o
pairwise
o-o
vote counting
o-o
adopted in
o-o
elections.
o-o
And doing that
o-o
should be
o-o
easier than
o-o
what early
o-o
North American
o-o
colonists
o-o
had to do
o-o
to get
o-o
democracy.
o-o
They had to fight
o-o
with physical
o-o
weapons.
o-o
And they won
o-o
mostly because
o-o
France and Spain
o-o
and the Dutch
o-o
all fought against
o-o
England at
o-o
the same time
o-o
the thirteen
o-o
colonies
o-o
were fighting for
o-o
independence
o-o
from England.
o-o
Now the fights
o-o
occur in
o-o
cyberspace
o-o
and in the news.
o-o
Those fights
o-o
don't risk
o-o
your life.
o-o
And they're
o-o
winnable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I think I see
o-o
some light ahead.
o-o
You've shown us
o-o
a path to
o-o
better times.
o-o
I guess we just
o-o
need to fight
o-o
against some
o-o
feedback
o-o
loops.
o-o
The ones that
o-o
say we should
o-o
jump for joy
o-o
when a house
o-o
burns down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I see hope
o-o
for creating
o-o
ways to earn
o-o
more money
o-o
by making
o-o
things of

value.
o-o
But now my head's
