o-o
What do you
o-o
suppose
o-o
that would
o-o
look like?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Uh,
o-o
...
o-o
I reckon,
o-o
...
o-o
maybe
o-o
...
o-o
it might use
o-o
...
o-o
five stars?
o-o
...
o-o
Like
o-o
Amazon does?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a good start.
o-o
And why is that
o-o
approach smart?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If Amazon used
o-o
just one star
o-o
for each product,
o-o
like on an
o-o
'lection ballot,
o-o
that wouldn't be
o-o
enough info.
o-o
So what's needed
o-o
in elections
o-o
is more
o-o
info.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Yes indeed!
o-o
So if stars were
o-o
used in elections,
o-o
and the highest
o-o
count of stars
o-o
indicated
o-o
the winner,
o-o
how could you,
o-o
as a voter,
o-o
get some extra
o-o
influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm feelin'
o-o
like a dunce.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's try a
o-o
different
o-o
scenario.
o-o
Let's suppose
o-o
you're in the
o-o
audience at
o-o
a talent contest,
o-o
and the emcee
o-o
announces that
o-o
the loudness
o-o
of clapping
o-o
will determine
o-o
who wins.
o-o
How can you get
o-o
extra influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nor do I.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You could clap
o-o
really loud for
o-o
your favorites,
o-o
and just pretend
o-o
to clap for the
o-o
others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be
o-o
cheating.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a talent
o-o
contest, maybe,
o-o
maybe not.
o-o
At theater
o-o
events, that's
o-o
disrespectful.
o-o
But in an
o-o
election, with
o-o
money on the line,
o-o
that's just freedom
o-o
of expression.
o-o
It's voting,
o-o
but with an unfair
o-o
kind of vote
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, it's fighting!
o-o
Done on ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So when I rate
o-o
things on Amazon
o-o
I should only
o-o
use one star
o-o
or five stars?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you do that
o-o
on Amazon
o-o
you're being a
o-o
jerk.
o-o
But if that star
o-o
rating were used
o-o
in elections,
o-o
where so much
o-o
is at stake,
o-o
that tactic
o-o
would make
o-o
your ballot
o-o
have more impact
o-o
than ballots
o-o
marked
o-o
honestly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm still following
o-o

o-o
Too bad I can't
o-o

o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Bravo!
o-o
You see that
o-o
just collecting
o-o
more information
o-o
isn't enough.
o-o
How the information
o-o
is counted to
o-o
identify a
o-o
winner is so
o-o
important to
o-o
get right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the five star
o-o
method won't work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, I should
o-o
take a step back.
o-o
There are two parts
o-o
to any voting method.
o-o
There's the ballot
o-o
and there's the
o-o
counting of those
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What kind'a ballot
o-o
do we use
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost
o-o
every nation in the
o-o
world uses what's
o-o
increasingly called
o-o
the single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'Cause we can
o-o
only mark a
o-o
single choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
o-o
And there's just
o-o
one way to count
o-o
that kind of ballot.
o-o
Which is why
o-o
until recently
o-o
that ballot didn't
o-o
have a name.
o-o
The counting method
o-o
has different names.
o-o
It's the enemy
o-o
of fair voting
o-o
so it's worth
o-o
learning its names.
o-o
In the academic
o-o
world it's called
o-o
begin-italics plurality voting end-italics no-space .
o-o
In Canada
o-o
and other
o-o
British places
o-o
it's called
o-o
begin-italics first past the post end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it called
o-o
here in the states?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's just called
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah! With no name
o-o
it becomes harder
o-o
to fight against!
o-o
Imagine protesting
o-o
with a sign that says
o-o
begin-italics End That Unnamed
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that's the
o-o
enemy?
o-o
Plurality?
o-o
And it uses
o-o
the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
It is to
o-o
democracy
o-o
what a string
o-o
and two old hyphen-here style
o-o
tin cans
o-o
are to the
o-o
telephone.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's so
o-o
primitive.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the name
o-o
of a ballot where
o-o
each candidate
o-o
can be ranked at
o-o
a different level,
o-o
like on Amazon?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Academically
o-o
that's called a
o-o
ranked ballot,
o-o
or a score ballot,
o-o
depending on
o-o
how it's counted.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain freeze
o-o
big time!
o-o
Is that difference
o-o
really of prime
o-o
importance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To get the math
o-o
right, yes.
o-o
But both types
o-o
are better than
o-o
what we use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Isn't anything
o-o
better than what
o-o
we use now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost anything.
o-o
There's one
o-o
seductive
o-o
exception.
o-o
That's using points,
o-o
where each voter
o-o
is given a limited
o-o
number of points
o-o
to distribute
o-o
among the choices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is that because
o-o
a jerk could give
o-o
all his points
o-o
to a single
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's one
o-o
of its flaws.
o-o
If vote counting
o-o
methods
o-o
competed in
o-o
a limbo contest,
o-o
the points approach
o-o
would win
o-o
the limbo
o-o
contest,
o-o
as the
o-o
lowest.
o-o
Anything else
o-o
is like
o-o
pole vaulting
o-o
over what we
o-o
use now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So using ballots
o-o
that are like
o-o
Amazon stars ....
o-o
Wait a moment.
o-o
Does this mean
o-o
voting has to be
o-o
done electronically?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That wouldn't

Of course

columns of ovals

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly!
o-o
If everyone is
o-o
honest, then
o-o
simple counting
o-o
works fine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Simple counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If there are five columns,
o-o
a marked oval
o-o
in the begin-italics first choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
five Amazon stars,
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics second choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
four Amazon stars,
o-o
and so on down to
o-o
a mark in the
o-o
begin-italics fifth choice end-italics column
o-o
would be like marking
o-o
one Amazon star.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's simple?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A computer
o-o
would take care of doing
o-o
that counting.
o-o
You would just mark
o-o
the correct column
o-o
for each
o-o
candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Even hand counting
o-o
the ballots
o-o
that way
o-o
would be easy.
o-o
For simple counting
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the highest
o-o
such count
o-o
would win.
o-o
If everyone
o-o
is honest,
o-o
and ranks just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
at each level,
o-o
then that
o-o
works fine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Fat chance of that!
o-o
Honesty I mean.
o-o
It seems to be
o-o
getting less and less

in business

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes when money
o-o
is involved,
o-o
as it is in
o-o
politics,
o-o
that simple way
o-o
of counting
o-o
ratings is
o-o
vulnerable
o-o
to strategic
o-o
voters.
o-o
They can get
o-o
extra

o-o
using the

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm curious.
o-o
What happens
o-o
when Amazon

o-o
skipping the

middle ratings?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Amazon
o-o

we've been talking

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That kind of
o-o
ballot is asking

It allows a voter

how strongly the

o-o
simple kind of
o-o
improvement.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Consider the same
o-o
kind of ballot
o-o
we use now, the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballot.
o-o
But change the
o-o
instructions
o-o
and allow the voter
o-o
to mark more than
o-o
just one candidate.
o-o
That's called
o-o
approval
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, because you
o-o
either approve
o-o
each candidate or
o-o
leave their name
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

o-o
Facebook,
o-o

o-o

o-o
anything and
o-o
everything.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're getting this!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On Reddit
o-o
we can upvote
o-o
and downvote.
o-o
That's more
o-o
info.
o-o
Is that
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Only if it's
o-o
counted as
o-o
three ranking
o-o
levels.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Three?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Remember zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, an upvote
o-o
is like plus one.
o-o
And a downvote
o-o
is like minus one.
o-o
And neither
o-o
up nor down
o-o
is like zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If counted right
o-o
that could work.
o-o
But using
o-o
five levels
o-o
collects more
o-o
information
o-o
than three.
o-o
And when there are
o-o
lots and lots of candidates
o-o
then up to about twelve
o-o
levels would work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn

o-o
would always be from

the correct party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn

o-o

o-o

They look the same

That's ranking.

How can those marks
o-o
be counted
o-o
in a way
o-o
that holds up
o-o
under
o-o
scrutiny,
o-o
without
o-o
mutiny?

That's harder than
o-o
any jigsaw
o-o
puzzle
o-o
I've ever
o-o
seen.

Admittedly,
o-o
if I asked this
o-o
on a test
o-o
I might soon
o-o
be under
o-o
arrest
o-o
for cerebral
o-o
torment
o-o
without written
o-o
consent.
o-o
But take a guess.

Maybe
o-o
...
o-o
we could start
o-o
by looking at
o-o
...
o-o
just the top
o-o
part.
o-o
The top hyphen-here most
o-o
candidate
o-o
on each
o-o
ballot.
o-o
...
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Side step the fear
o-o
and persevere.

And the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who gets the
o-o
fewest
o-o
top marks
o-o
...
o-o
gets
o-o
tossed aside?

Then the ballots
o-o
are modified
o-o
to hide the
o-o
one dismissed.
o-o
Then the process
o-o
repeats.
o-o
Until just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
remains?

That counting
o-o
method has
o-o
many
o-o
different names.
o-o
Here let's call it
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting.
o-o
Among friends,
o-o
or when a smartphone
o-o
isn't handy,
o-o
that method
o-o
is dandy.
o-o
It works well
o-o
enough that it's
o-o
been used in real
o-o
elections.
o-o
In fact it's used
o-o
in Maine, Alaska,
o-o
and Australia,
o-o
in San Francisco,
o-o
and a few
o-o
other places.

So I didn't
o-o
guess right?

This is hard stuff.
o-o
Although
o-o
not as hard
o-o
as using an
o-o
abacus
o-o
to calculate
o-o
the square root
o-o
of your social
o-o
security
o-o
number.
o-o
Yet you deserve
o-o
another
o-o
A plus.
o-o
For the basic
o-o
idea of
o-o
using something
o-o
besides counting
o-o
marks and looking
o-o
for the biggest
o-o
count.
end-lyric

Your reactions
o-o
are such a
o-o
contrast
o-o
to what
o-o
in the past
o-o
would have been
o-o
kicks in the
o-o
ass.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yet this
o-o
counting method
o-o
is flawed.
o-o
Instant
o-o
runoff
o-o
voting
o-o
was used in
o-o
the city of
o-o
Burlington,
o-o
in Vermont,
o-o
and it failed.
o-o
And it failed again
o-o
in Alaska.
o-o
In those two
o-o
elections
o-o
the candidate
o-o
who won
o-o
was not
o-o
the one
o-o
who deserved
o-o
to win.
o-o
We can do
o-o
better.
o-o
So which
o-o
candidate
o-o
should be the
o-o
first to be
o-o
eliminated?
