ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm stumpified.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've heard of the
o-o
electoral college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's garbage!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, but one thing
o-o
it gets quite right.
o-o
The winner
o-o
of the
o-o
electoral
o-o
fight
o-o
has to get
o-o
more than half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Here's the fraction.
o-o
A half.
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
my fraction fears
o-o
have disappeared,
o-o
...
o-o
for now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
More than half,
o-o
that's called a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If a
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a
o-o
majority,
o-o
then vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
o-o
That's so important
o-o
that Roberts
o-o
Rules of Order
o-o
have always
o-o
insisted
o-o
on getting
o-o
majority
o-o
support
o-o
to declare
o-o
a winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So getting more
o-o
than half the votes
o-o
is a must.
o-o
But how can
o-o
there always
o-o
be a
o-o
majority?
o-o
Especially
o-o
when there are
o-o
more than two
o-o
candidates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is hard.
o-o
Is it time
o-o
for recess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Remember that
o-o
business success
o-o
is your reward
o-o
for
o-o
sorting
o-o
this out.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In sports,
o-o
how are teams ranked?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't teams ranked
o-o
based on,
o-o
... well, ...
o-o
I think they get
o-o
points,
o-o
or maybe lose points,
o-o
from each game.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
How many teams
o-o
compete in each game?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Just two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And what's that called,
o-o
two at a time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Two at a time,
o-o
that's a pair
o-o
at a time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise.
o-o
That's the name.
o-o
So how would
o-o
that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Pairwise, ...
o-o
ah, counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
pairwise counting.
o-o
It's a very important
o-o
thing.
o-o
How would that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's counting,
o-o
but it's beyond
o-o
what my brain
o-o
can handle
o-o
begin-highlight
without an assist
o-o
from some
o-o
Brainiac
o-o
Elixer.
end-highlight
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If it were
o-o
sports teams,
o-o
then,
o-o
...
o-o
well,
o-o
a team would be
o-o
the worst
o-o
loser if
o-o
it lost all
o-o
its pairwise
o-o
matches.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Keep going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So the loser
o-o
of all the
o-o
pairwise contests
o-o
would get
o-o
eliminated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N then we'd
o-o
look for the
o-o
next loser,
o-o
from the remaining
o-o
teams, er,
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And when there's
o-o
just one team,
o-o
or candidate,
o-o
remaining, that
o-o
would be the
o-o
winner, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
That pairwise
o-o
elimination
o-o
process would work,
o-o
up to a point.
o-o
A simple shortcut
o-o
approach is to
o-o
look for the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who wins all
o-o
of their pairwise
o-o
contests.
o-o
The academic
o-o
world calls that a
o-o
Condorcet
begin-explain pronounced cone-dor-SAY end-explain
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Condorcet,
o-o
that sounds stuffy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's named after
o-o
a French guy
o-o
whose title was the
o-o
Marques de
o-o
Condorcet.
o-o
For a long time
o-o
Europeans
o-o
thought he was the
o-o
first person to
o-o
publish a
o-o
description
o-o
of that method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I can see,
o-o
as you say,
o-o
the concept
o-o
is the key.
o-o
Yet on a test,
o-o
students would be
o-o
asked to recall,
o-o
or recognize,
o-o
his name.
o-o
That's dumb.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see.
o-o
A Condorcet winner
o-o
would get more than
o-o
half the votes,
o-o
a majority,
o-o
without any
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this is the
o-o
best way to make
o-o
selections
o-o
in elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sometimes
o-o
there's no
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner.
o-o
Using the elimination
o-o
approach, it can
o-o
reach a point where
o-o
none of the candidates
o-o
loses all its
o-o
pairwise contests.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Partial losers.
o-o
But no total
o-o
losers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what?
o-o
Count how many
o-o
losses?
o-o
Or measure
o-o
how big the
o-o
losses are?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A plus
o-o
for thinking
o-o
of those
o-o
ideas!
o-o
Actually
o-o
there are many
o-o
ways to resolve
o-o
those cases.
o-o
Even better,
o-o
there are methods
o-o
that don't first
o-o
look for Condorcet
o-o
winners or losers.
o-o
Instead they use
o-o
the pairwise counts
o-o
in ways that
o-o
don't need to do
o-o
anything
o-o
special.
o-o
Yet they find the
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner when
o-o
one exists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's
o-o
beautiful
o-o
advanced
o-o
mathematics.
o-o
After all,
o-o
magic is a
o-o
word for what
o-o
we don't yet
o-o
fully
o-o
comprehend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like how
o-o
my landlord
o-o
calculates my
o-o
utility
o-o
bill.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is there some
o-o
method you like,
o-o
that you could
o-o
explain,
o-o
in a way that
o-o
makes that magic
o-o
understandable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
But before that
o-o
will make sense
o-o
I should ask you
o-o
how many pairwise
o-o
counts are involved
o-o
in each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess two.
o-o
If the two
o-o
candidates are
o-o
named Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
there's the count
o-o
for how many voters,
o-o
well, support,
o-o
uh, Pinoke
o-o
over Oscar.
o-o
And there's
o-o
the other count,
o-o
of how many voters
o-o
prefer Oscar
o-o
over Pinoke.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And will those two
o-o
numbers always
o-o
add up to the
o-o
total number
o-o
of voters?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think so.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but what if
o-o
some voters rank
o-o
Pinoke and Oscar
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, that means
o-o
there will be
o-o
a third number.
o-o
The number of voters
o-o
who rank them
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Yes there are
o-o
three numbers
o-o
for each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
o-o
But when summarized,
o-o
the third count
o-o
can be omitted.
o-o
This means the
o-o
pairwise numbers
o-o
can be put into
o-o
a table, a square grid.
o-o
And each row
o-o
would be labelled
o-o
with the name
o-o
of a candidate.
o-o
And the columns
o-o
would be labelled
o-o
with the same
o-o
names in the same
o-o
sequence.
o-o
And each cell
o-o
would contain
o-o
a count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So if the
o-o
candidates
o-o
are named
o-o
Pinoke, Oscar,
o-o
Barack, and
o-o
Hypatia,
o-o
it would be
o-o
a four by four
o-o
grid, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
o-o
Now you're ready
o-o
to see the magic
o-o
of the counting
o-o
method I like
o-o
best.
o-o
It re hyphen-here arranges
o-o
the sequence of
o-o
candidates,
o-o
in the rows
o-o
and columns.
o-o
The goal is to
o-o
re hyphen-here arrange
o-o
the sequence
o-o
until the biggest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
upper hyphen-here right
o-o
triangular area
o-o
of the grid,
o-o
and the smallest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
other half,
o-o
the lower hyphen-here left
o-o
triangular area.
o-o
Then we look at
o-o
that sequence.
o-o
It indicates
o-o
not only who is
o-o
most popular,
o-o
but who is second
o-o
most popular,
o-o
who is third most
o-o
popular, and
o-o
so on down to
o-o
who is least
o-o
popular.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that method
o-o
called?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The Condorcet
o-o
Kemeny
o-o
method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That method
o-o
sounds more
o-o
convoluted
o-o
than building a
o-o
spiral staircase
o-o
down to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe that's the
o-o
kind of math
o-o
your landlord
o-o
uses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that the
o-o
fairest method?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Not always.
o-o
The very fairest
o-o
vote hyphen-here counting
o-o
system would be
o-o
even more complex.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So math
o-o
really is
o-o
the stairway
o-o
to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do math
o-o
experts
o-o
even have
o-o
all the
o-o
answers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's a
o-o
mathematical
o-o
proof that proves
o-o
it's not possible
o-o
for there to be
o-o
a voting method
o-o
that has no flaws.
o-o
So it's complicated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Sounds like life and
o-o
relationships.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There are some
o-o
fairness
o-o
characteristics,
o-o
criteria,
o-o
that voting methods
o-o
pass or fail.
o-o
Math geeks know which
o-o
counting methods
o-o
can sometimes
o-o
fail which criteria.
o-o
But there has been
o-o
no research
o-o
to measure
o-o
how begin-italics often end-italics
o-o
each method fails,
o-o
or rather
o-o
passes,
o-o
each one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why hasn't that
o-o
research
o-o
been done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Who would pay for
o-o
a search
o-o
to find the
o-o
best
o-o
replacement?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoever pays
o-o
for research
o-o
about
o-o
dinosaurs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And
o-o
research in
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Most of that
o-o
funding comes from
o-o
the government.
o-o
Of course the
o-o
people who have
o-o
power
o-o
don't want to pay
o-o
for research
o-o
that reveals the
o-o
unfairness
o-o
that underpins
o-o
their power.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A black widow
o-o
spider's web of
o-o
corruption!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think we've
o-o
learned what's
o-o
needed.
o-o
Ranked hyphen-here choice ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
counting.
o-o
So are we done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now math
o-o
is feeling like
o-o
a boa constrictor
o-o
wrapping around
o-o
my lungs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fight it off with
o-o
a deep breath.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-explain Takes a deep breath. end-explain
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a
o-o
foolish tactic
o-o
against a
o-o
boa constrictor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're fighting
o-o
against fear.
o-o
This will be
o-o
easier.
o-o
So far we've
o-o
been talking
o-o
about how to
o-o
choose a
o-o
mayor,
o-o
governor,
o-o
or president
o-o
with fairness.
o-o
That's the first half.
o-o
But what happens
o-o
when there are
o-o
lots of seats
o-o
to fill,
o-o
like in
o-o
Congress?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain overload!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh right.
o-o
Instead, try this.
o-o
Imagine a
o-o
group of friends
o-o
eating together
o-o
and choosing
o-o
two pizzas.
o-o
If the majority
o-o
want a
o-o
pork sausage
o-o
topping,
o-o
and about
o-o
a third of
o-o
the friends are
o-o
Jewish,
o-o
how should the
o-o
topping
o-o
for the second
o-o
pizza
o-o
be chosen?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In the non hyphen-here math
o-o
verse,
o-o
they would start
o-o
a holy war.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't the
o-o
second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate,
o-o
er, topping,
o-o
be elected,
o-o
er,
o-o
selected?
o-o
For the second
o-o
pizza.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular has
o-o
more than one
o-o
meaning.
o-o
So let's try
o-o
yet another
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
five wolves and
o-o
four sheep vote
o-o
on what to eat
o-o
for dinner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ha! The five wolves
o-o
would eat the
o-o
four sheep!
o-o
And claim it's fair
o-o
because it's
o-o
democracy!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So us
o-o
minorities,
o-o
like the sheep,
o-o
need a way to
o-o
fight against a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Bill of Rights
o-o
is nice,
o-o
but that's
o-o
not enough
o-o
to protect us
o-o
minorities
o-o
from white
o-o
supremacists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
As you see,
o-o
just getting a
o-o
majority
o-o
is just part of
o-o
the big picture.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought you were
o-o
showing us
o-o
everything on
o-o
a twelve hyphen-here foot
o-o
TV screen.
o-o
Where on the screen
o-o
should we
o-o
be looking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see somethin'.
o-o
If districts
o-o
were filled with
o-o
wolves 'n sheep,
o-o
'n each district
o-o
had slightly more
o-o
wolves than sheep,
o-o
then every
o-o
district would
o-o
elect a wolf.
o-o
Then Congress would
o-o
be nothin' but wolves.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's not far from
o-o
what are now
o-o
mostly
o-o
white males.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In Europe,
o-o
instead of just
o-o
wolves and sheep,
o-o
they have a
o-o
handful of
o-o
political parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like wolves and sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sure.
o-o
On the ballot
o-o
each voter marks their
o-o
favorite
o-o
political party.
o-o
Let's say
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
mark their
o-o
ballot for
o-o
the Pirate
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'd join that one.
o-o
It sounds like
o-o
they're against
o-o
puppets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do they slash
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
with their
o-o
swords?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They don't carry
o-o
swords,
o-o
or dress like
o-o
pirates.
o-o
But they do
o-o
oppose
o-o
what they think is
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Go pirates!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In some
o-o
European
o-o
countries,
o-o
adjustments
o-o
are done to
o-o
ensure the
o-o
Pirate party,
o-o
and every
o-o
other party,
o-o
gets their fair share
o-o
of seats in
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It hides the
o-o
unfairness of
o-o
still using
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballots.
o-o
Yet lots of
o-o
people like it
o-o
because
o-o
it yields
o-o
what's called
o-o
begin-italics proportional
o-o
representation end-italics no-space .
o-o
So each voter
o-o
can point to
o-o
someone in
o-o
parliament
o-o
and claim their vote
o-o
helped elect
o-o
that MP,
o-o
er,
o-o
member of
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
From reading
o-o
news about
o-o
Europe those
o-o
governments
o-o
have as much
o-o
corruption
o-o
as us.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
they focus on
o-o
the balance of power
o-o
between parties,
o-o
but they allow
o-o
party insiders
o-o
to control which
o-o
politicians
o-o
win the seats.
o-o
So back here
o-o
in the United States,
o-o
suppose each district
o-o
had two
o-o
representatives
o-o
instead of one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That would double
o-o
the size of
o-o
the house of
o-o
representatives.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't that
o-o
be avoided
o-o
by making
o-o
each district
o-o
double the size?
o-o
And having half
o-o
as many districts?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Very good!
o-o
And using a fraction
o-o
no less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's like building
o-o
a staircase.
o-o
Half as many steps
o-o
means each step
o-o
is twice as high.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wow.
o-o
Now you're
o-o
stepping up
o-o
to design
o-o
a new Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course the
o-o
most popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
would win
o-o
the first seat.
o-o
In a
o-o
double hyphen-here sized
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So how's the
o-o
second seat filled?
o-o
In a way that's fair.
o-o
For the sheep,
o-o
and goats,
o-o
and pigs?
o-o
Or maybe I should say,
o-o
for women to get
o-o
the representation
o-o
we deserve.

Using simple math,
o-o
a computer can
o-o
calculate which
o-o
voters are 
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
by the first hyphen-here seat
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Since that math
o-o
is simple,
o-o
I don't need to
o-o
hear about it,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sweet!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The ballots
o-o
of those
o-o
well hyphen-here represented
o-o
voters
o-o
would have their
o-o
influence
o-o
greatly reduced.
o-o
Often all the
o-o
way to zero.
o-o
The remaining
o-o
voters still have
o-o
full influence
o-o
for their ballots.
o-o
Pairwise counting
o-o
is done again,
o-o
and the most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
wins the
o-o
second seat.
o-o
In this
o-o
district.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm guessing the
o-o
effect would be
o-o
to elect one
o-o
Republican
o-o
and one
o-o
Democrat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Typically yes,
o-o
assuming both
o-o
parties offer
o-o
good candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That means
o-o
there would be
o-o
more than just
o-o
one
o-o
Republican
o-o
'n one
o-o
Democrat
o-o
in the race?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes because
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
o-o
So we need
o-o
to allow
o-o
for the
o-o
possibility
o-o
that one
o-o
of the
o-o
parties
o-o
only offers
o-o
disliked
o-o
candidates,
o-o
while the other
o-o
party offers
o-o
better
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, if, say,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party only
o-o
offered puppet
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Pinoke
o-o
'n Oscar,
o-o
'n the Democratic
o-o
party offered
o-o
anti hyphen-here corruption
o-o
candidates,
o-o
like Barack
o-o
'n Hypatia,
o-o
then both winners
o-o
could be Democrats?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This seems like a
o-o
winning
o-o
pole vault
o-o
over our low
o-o
limbo bar,
o-o
where we
o-o
are now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But if every district
o-o
elects one
o-o
Republican and
o-o
one Democrat,
o-o
then Congress
o-o
would be tied.
o-o
That's cockeyed.
o-o
The population
o-o
is not
o-o
evenly
o-o
divided
o-o
between the
o-o
two parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
To fix that
o-o
unfair balance,
o-o
we make the
o-o
districts a little
o-o
bigger. And we
o-o
reserve a few
o-o
extra seats,
o-o
which are called
o-o
statewide seats.
o-o
Then we can do
o-o
the party hyphen-here based
o-o
adjustment to
o-o
figure out which
o-o
party deserves to win
o-o
each of those
o-o
statewide seats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And party
o-o
insiders
o-o
would choose
o-o
whose butts
o-o
will fill
o-o
those seats?
o-o
That seems
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Lots of
o-o
European
o-o
nations
o-o
do it that way,
o-o
but you're right,
o-o
it's not fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why are those
o-o
voters so
o-o
stupid?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The people
o-o
in power
o-o
are the ones who
o-o
have to approve
o-o
any change.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see.
o-o
The members of
o-o
parliament
o-o
only embrace
o-o
a change if it's
o-o
likely to get
o-o
themselves
o-o
re hyphen-here elected.
o-o
Otherwise it
o-o
would be as
o-o
unlikely as
o-o
turkeys voting
o-o
in favor of
o-o
Thanksgiving.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another barrier!
o-o
Political
o-o
turkeys.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Far fairer is
o-o
to look at the
o-o
ballots again
o-o
to identify
o-o
the most popular
o-o
of the
o-o
un hyphen-here elected candidates.
o-o
The most popular
o-o
such candidate
o-o
from the
o-o
correct party
o-o
would fill that
o-o
party's
o-o
extra seat.
o-o
Then just repeat
o-o
that process
o-o
for each next seat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That sounds like
o-o
it would rip
o-o
control away from
o-o
party insiders.
o-o
And empower
o-o
the voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That seems much much
o-o
fairer than what
o-o
we've got now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With no
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
elections
o-o
would no
o-o
longer be
o-o
limited
o-o
to just one
o-o
candidate
o-o
per party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
no more blocking,
o-o
like how
o-o
Hillary
o-o
Clinton
o-o
got blocked
o-o
in two thousand eight.
o-o
Right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
name-desha
o-o
you're bright.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's just counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And that's what the
o-o
important parts of
o-o
mathematics
o-o
are mostly about,
o-o
counting.
end-lyric




ambee sings-damien amenn
So how can the
o-o
ballot handle
o-o
lots of
o-o
candidates
o-o
from lots
o-o
of parties?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A separate
o-o
ballot question
o-o
can ask voters
o-o
to rank the
o-o
political parties.
o-o
That gives us the
o-o
info we need
o-o
to calculate
o-o
the popularity
o-o
of the
o-o
parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting for parties?
o-o
Is that really
o-o
a thing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's what lots of
o-o
people in lots
o-o
of nations do
o-o
on their ballots.
o-o
Using that info,
o-o
along with
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots,
o-o
the most popular
o-o
parties can be
o-o
allowed to have
o-o
two or three of
o-o
their candidates
o-o
in each race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the least popular
o-o
parties get excluded?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That makes sense to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And the biggest
o-o
third parties
o-o
get one candidate
o-o
each, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That gives small
o-o
parties an
o-o
opportunity
o-o
to grow.
o-o
And even to
o-o
overtake
o-o
big parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't like names,
o-o
but this is
o-o
getting
o-o
complex.
o-o
Is there a name
o-o
for all of
o-o
this mess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It is sort of like
o-o
a jigsaw puzzle
o-o
with lots of pieces,
o-o
and different
o-o
pieces would work,
o-o
and they have lots
o-o
of names.
o-o
The method
o-o
that reaches farthest
o-o
toward what
o-o
I've described
o-o
is called
o-o
VoteFair Ranking.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
VoteFair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
FairVote?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
VoteFair
o-o
is a ranking
o-o
method I like.
o-o
FairVote is an
o-o
organization
o-o
that promotes
o-o
what they call
o-o
begin-italics ranked choice end-italics
o-o
voting,
o-o
but that name
o-o
actually
o-o
covers two methods,
o-o
instant runoff
o-o
voting and
o-o
something called
o-o
the single
o-o
transferable
o-o
vote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's confusing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's overwhelming
o-o
to me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
It's another
o-o
reason we
o-o
don't teach
o-o
this stuff,
o-o
even in
o-o
college courses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
OK, you like
o-o
VoteFair something.
o-o
Is there a
o-o
less hyphen-here specific
o-o
name?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise
o-o
vote counting.
o-o
That's the most
o-o
important part.
o-o
Because pairwise counts
o-o
reveal not just support
o-o
but opposition.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise vote
o-o
counting
o-o
that you
o-o
recommend?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Plus adjustments
o-o
we've discussed that
o-o
give fuller
o-o
representation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
To the sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs
o-o
defending
o-o
themselves against
o-o
the wolves.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how hard's it
o-o
to do pairwise
o-o
counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
All the counting
o-o
is done by computer,
o-o
so a tap on the screen
o-o
is all you need
o-o
in a real
o-o
election.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the
o-o
barrier against
o-o
using ranked choice
o-o
ballots and
o-o
pairwise counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Up until a few
o-o
decades ago, when
o-o
computers came along,
o-o
doing the math by hand
o-o
was the big barrier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But now we have
o-o
computers, so
o-o
what's stopping us
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fear.
o-o
Especially
o-o
a fear of math.
o-o
Officially
o-o
that's called
o-o
mathematical
o-o
anxiety.
o-o
Lots of people
o-o
have it 'cause
o-o
most people
o-o
don't trust what
o-o
they don't
o-o
understand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Math
o-o
anxiety.
o-o
That's what I
o-o
was infected
o-o
by.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course
o-o
the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
don't want
o-o
anyone
o-o
to cut the
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
they use to
o-o
control
o-o
politicians.
o-o
And their minions,
o-o
the insiders
o-o
within the two
o-o
political
o-o
parties,
o-o
don't want to
o-o
get fired.
o-o
Or lose their
o-o
perks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why isn't the
o-o
benefit
o-o
of greater
o-o
fairness
o-o
attracting
o-o
voters like a
o-o
magnet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You are so
o-o
na&#239;ve.
o-o
Greedy folks
o-o
are in control
o-o
and they don't want
o-o
fairness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those of us
o-o
who are
o-o
workin' hard
o-o
yet sufferin'
o-o
want our fair share
o-o
of the
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And rich people
o-o
want to protect
o-o
their too hyphen-here big slice
o-o
of economic pie,
o-o
probably with
o-o
vanilla
o-o
ice cream and
o-o
three cherries
o-o
on top.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Speaking of that,
o-o
here are colored blocks
o-o
that represent
o-o
nine ballots,
o-o
and the colors
o-o
represent
o-o
ice cream flavors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Pretty colors!
o-o
Which flavors?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Dark brown is
o-o
chocolate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yum!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pink is for
o-o
strawberry.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not a fan
o-o
of pink.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
This color represents
o-o
mint chocolate
o-o
chip.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And I presume
o-o
the last color
o-o
is vanilla.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But you haven't
o-o
explained why
o-o
you're pointing
o-o
out these nine
o-o
colored blocks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Each stack
o-o
represents
o-o
one ballot,
o-o
with the voter's
o-o
favorite
o-o
on top,
o-o
and least hyphen-here favorite
o-o
on bottom.
o-o
With these nine
o-o
ranked choice
o-o
ballots
o-o
the winning flavor
o-o
can be mint
o-o
chocolate chip,
o-o
or strawberry,
o-o
or vanilla,
o-o
depending on
o-o
which counting
o-o
method is used.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As usual,
o-o
brown always
o-o
loses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, I see
o-o
the counting
o-o
method
o-o
matters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
o-o
And yet,
o-o
almost any
o-o
method is better
o-o
than what we've
o-o
got now.
end-lyric
