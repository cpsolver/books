ambee sings-desha amenn
That's garbage!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, but one thing
o-o
it gets quite right.
sentence-next
o-o
The winner
o-o
of the
o-o
electoral
o-o
fight
o-o
has to get
o-o
more than half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Here's the fraction.
sentence-next
o-o
A half.
sentence-next
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
my fraction fears
o-o
have disappeared,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
for now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
More than half,
o-o
that's called a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If a
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a
o-o
majority,
o-o
then vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
sentence-next
o-o
That's so important
o-o
that Roberts

o-o
have always
o-o
insisted
o-o
on getting
o-o
majority
o-o
support
o-o
to declare
o-o
a winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So getting more
o-o
than half the votes
o-o
is a must.
sentence-next
o-o
But how can
o-o
there always
o-o
be a
o-o
majority?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
when there are
o-o
more than two

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Exactly.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is hard.
sentence-next
o-o
Is it time

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Remember that

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In sports,
o-o
how are teams ranked?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't teams ranked
o-o
based on,
o-o
... well, ...
sentence-next
o-o
I think they get
o-o
points,
o-o
or maybe lose points,
o-o
from each game.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
How many teams
o-o
compete in each game?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Just two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And what's that called,
o-o
two at a time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Two at a time,
o-o
that's a pair
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the name.
sentence-next
o-o
So how would
o-o
that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Pairwise, ...
sentence-next
o-o
ah, counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
pairwise counting.
sentence-next
o-o
It's a very important
o-o
thing.
sentence-next
o-o
How would that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's counting,
o-o
but it's beyond

o-o
begin-highlight

end-highlight
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If it were
o-o
sports teams,
o-o
then,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
well,
o-o
a team would be
o-o
the worst
o-o
loser if
o-o
it lost all
o-o
its pairwise
o-o
matches.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Keep going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So the loser
o-o
of all the
o-o
pairwise contests
o-o
would get
o-o
eliminated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N then we'd
o-o
look for the
o-o
next loser,
o-o
from the remaining
o-o
teams, er,
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And when there's
o-o
just one team,
o-o
or candidate,
o-o
remaining, that
o-o
would be the
o-o
winner, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
That pairwise
o-o
elimination
o-o
process would work,
o-o
up to a point.
sentence-next
o-o
A simple shortcut
o-o
approach is to
o-o
look for the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who wins all
o-o
of their pairwise

contests.
sentence-next

The academic

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Condorcet,
o-o
that sounds stuffy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's named after

o-o
For a long time
o-o
Europeans

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I can see,
o-o
as you say,
o-o
the concept
o-o
is the key.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet on a test,
o-o
students would be
o-o
asked to recall,
o-o

o-o
his name.
sentence-next
o-o
That's dumb.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see.
sentence-next
o-o
A Condorcet winner
o-o
would get more than
o-o
half the votes,
o-o
a majority,
o-o
without any
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this is the
o-o
best way to make
o-o
selections
o-o
in elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sometimes
o-o
there's no
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner.
sentence-next
o-o
Using the elimination
o-o
approach, it can
o-o
reach a point where
o-o
none of the candidates
o-o
loses all its

pairwise contests.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Partial losers.
sentence-next
o-o
But no total
o-o
losers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what?
sentence-next
o-o
Count how many
o-o
losses?
sentence-next
o-o
Or measure
o-o
how big the
o-o
losses are?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A plus
o-o
for thinking
o-o
of those
o-o
ideas!
sentence-next
o-o
Actually
o-o
there are many
o-o
ways to resolve
o-o
those cases.
sentence-next
o-o
Even better,
o-o
there are methods
o-o
that don't first
o-o
look for Condorcet
o-o
winners or losers.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead they use
o-o
the pairwise counts
o-o
in ways that
o-o
don't need to do
o-o
anything
o-o
special.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet they find the
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner when
o-o
one exists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's
o-o
beautiful

sentence-next
o-o
After all,
o-o
magic is a

word for what
o-o
we don't yet

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like how
o-o
my landlord

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is there some

method you like,

that you could

explain,
o-o
in a way that
o-o
makes that magic
o-o
understandable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But before that
o-o
will make sense
o-o
I should ask you
o-o
how many pairwise
o-o
counts are involved
o-o
in each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess two.
sentence-next
o-o
If the two
o-o
candidates are
o-o
named Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
there's the count
o-o
for how many voters,
o-o
well, support,
o-o
uh, Pinoke
o-o
over Oscar.
sentence-next
o-o
And there's
o-o
the other count,
o-o
of how many voters
o-o
prefer Oscar
o-o
over Pinoke.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And will those two
o-o
numbers always
o-o
add up to the
o-o
total number
o-o
of voters?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think so.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but what if
o-o
some voters rank
o-o
Pinoke and Oscar
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, that means
o-o
there will be
o-o
a third number.
sentence-next
o-o
The number of voters
o-o
who rank them
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes there are
o-o
three numbers
o-o
for each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
sentence-next
o-o
But when summarized,
o-o
the third count
o-o
can be omitted.
sentence-next
o-o
This means the
o-o
pairwise numbers
o-o
can be put into
o-o
a table, a square grid.
sentence-next
o-o
And each row
o-o
would be labeled
o-o
with the name
o-o
of a candidate.
sentence-next
o-o
And the columns
o-o
would be labeled
o-o
with the same
o-o
names in the same
o-o
sequence.
sentence-next
o-o
And each cell
o-o
would contain
o-o
a count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So if the
o-o
candidates
o-o
are named
o-o
Pinoke, Oscar,
o-o
Barack, and
o-o
Hypatia,
o-o
it would be
o-o
a four by four
o-o
grid, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're ready
o-o
to see the magic
o-o
of the counting
o-o
method I like
o-o
best.
sentence-next
o-o
It re hyphen-here arranges
o-o
the sequence of
o-o
candidates,
o-o
in the rows
o-o
and columns.
sentence-next
o-o
The goal is to
o-o
re hyphen-here arrange
o-o
the sequence
o-o
until the biggest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
upper hyphen-here right
o-o
triangular area
o-o
of the grid,
o-o
and the smallest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
other half,
o-o
the lower hyphen-here left
o-o
triangular area.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we look at
o-o
that sequence.
sentence-next
o-o
It indicates
o-o
not only who is
o-o
most popular,
o-o
but who is second
o-o
most popular,
o-o
who is third most
o-o
popular, and
o-o
so on down to
o-o
who is least
o-o
popular.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that method
o-o
called?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The Condorcet
o-o
Kemeny
o-o
method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That method
o-o
sounds more
o-o
convoluted
o-o
than building a
o-o
spiral staircase
o-o
down to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe that's the
o-o
kind of math
o-o
your landlord
o-o
uses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that the
o-o
fairest method?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Not always.
sentence-next
o-o
The very fairest
o-o
vote hyphen-here counting
o-o
system would be
o-o
even more complex.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So math
o-o
really is
o-o
the stairway
o-o
to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do math
o-o
experts
o-o
even have

all the

end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn

end-lyric

o-o
Math geeks know which

each one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

sentence-next
o-o
Of course the
