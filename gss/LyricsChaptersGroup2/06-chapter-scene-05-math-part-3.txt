I'm stumpified.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've heard of the
o-o
electoral college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's garbage!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah, but one thing
o-o
it gets quite right.
o-o
The winner
o-o
of the
o-o
electoral
o-o
fight
o-o
has to get
o-o
more than half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Here's the fraction.
o-o
A half.
o-o
Fortunately
o-o
my fraction fears
o-o
have disappeared,
o-o
...
o-o
for now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
More than half,
o-o
that's called a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If a
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a
o-o
majority,
o-o
then vote splitting
o-o
can't happen.
o-o
That's so important
o-o
that Roberts
o-o
Rules of Order
o-o
have always
o-o
insisted
o-o
on getting
o-o
majority
o-o
support
o-o
to declare
o-o
a winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So getting more
o-o
than half the votes
o-o
is a must.
o-o
But how can
o-o
there always
o-o
be a
o-o
majority?
o-o
Especially
o-o
when there are
o-o
more than two
o-o
candidates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Take a guess.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This is hard.
o-o
Is it time
o-o
for recess?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Remember that
o-o
business success
o-o
is your reward
o-o
for
o-o
sorting
o-o
this out.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In sports,
o-o
how are teams ranked?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aren't teams ranked
o-o
based on,
o-o
... well, ...
o-o
I think they get
o-o
points,
o-o
or maybe lose points,
o-o
from each game.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
How many teams
o-o
compete in each game?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Just two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And what's that called,
o-o
two at a time?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Two at a time,
o-o
that's a pair
o-o
at a time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Pairwise.
o-o
That's the name.
o-o
So how would
o-o
that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Pairwise, ...
o-o
ah, counting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes,
o-o
pairwise counting.
o-o
It's a very important
o-o
thing.
o-o
How would that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's counting,
o-o
but it's beyond
o-o
what my brain
o-o
can handle
o-o
begin-highlight
without an assist
o-o
from some
o-o
Brainiac
o-o
Elixer.
end-highlight
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If it were
o-o
sports teams,
o-o
then,
o-o
...
o-o
well,
o-o
a team would be
o-o
the worst
o-o
loser if
o-o
it lost all
o-o
its pairwise
o-o
matches.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Keep going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So the loser
o-o
of all the
o-o
pairwise contests
o-o
would get
o-o
eliminated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N then we'd
o-o
look for the
o-o
next loser,
o-o
from the remaining
o-o
teams, er,
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And when there's
o-o
just one team,
o-o
or candidate,
o-o
remaining, that
o-o
would be the
o-o
winner, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
That pairwise
o-o
elimination
o-o
process would work,
o-o
up to a point.
o-o
A simple shortcut
o-o
approach is to
o-o
look for the
o-o
candidate
o-o
who wins all
o-o
of their pairwise
o-o
contests.
o-o
The academic
o-o
world calls that a
o-o
Condorcet
begin-explain pronounced cone-dor-SAY end-explain
o-o
winner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Condorcet,
o-o
that sounds stuffy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's named after
o-o
a French guy
o-o
whose title was the
o-o
Marques de
o-o
Condorcet.
o-o
For a long time
o-o
Europeans
o-o
thought he was the
o-o
first person to
o-o
publish a
o-o
description
o-o
of that method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I can see,
o-o
as you say,
o-o
the concept
o-o
is the key.
o-o
Yet on a test,
o-o
students would be
o-o
asked to recall,
o-o
or recognize,
o-o
his name.
o-o
That's dumb.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see.
o-o
A Condorcet winner
o-o
would get more than
o-o
half the votes,
o-o
a majority,
o-o
without any
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this is the
o-o
best way to make
o-o
selections
o-o
in elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sometimes
o-o
there's no
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner.
o-o
Using the elimination
o-o
approach, it can
o-o
reach a point where
o-o
none of the candidates
o-o
loses all its
o-o
pairwise contests.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Partial losers.
o-o
But no total
o-o
losers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then what?
o-o
Count how many
o-o
losses?
o-o
Or measure
o-o
how big the
o-o
losses are?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A plus
o-o
for thinking
o-o
of those
o-o
ideas!
o-o
Actually
o-o
there are many
o-o
ways to resolve
o-o
those cases.
o-o
Even better,
o-o
there are methods
o-o
that don't first
o-o
look for Condorcet
o-o
winners or losers.
o-o
Instead they use
o-o
the pairwise counts
o-o
in ways that
o-o
don't need to do
o-o
anything
o-o
special.
o-o
Yet they find the
o-o
Condorcet
o-o
winner when
o-o
one exists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds like
o-o
magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's
o-o
beautiful
o-o
advanced
o-o
mathematics.
o-o
After all,
o-o
magic is a
o-o
word for what
o-o
we don't yet
o-o
fully
o-o
comprehend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like how
o-o
my landlord
o-o
calculates my
o-o
utility
o-o
bill.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is there some
o-o
method you like,
o-o
that you could
o-o
explain,
o-o
in a way that
o-o
makes that magic
o-o
understandable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
o-o
But before that
o-o
will make sense
o-o
I should ask you
o-o
how many pairwise
o-o
counts are involved
o-o
in each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll guess two.
o-o
If the two
o-o
candidates are
o-o
named Pinoke
o-o
and Oscar,
o-o
there's the count
o-o
for how many voters,
o-o
well, support,
o-o
uh, Pinoke
o-o
over Oscar.
o-o
And there's
o-o
the other count,
o-o
of how many voters
o-o
prefer Oscar
o-o
over Pinoke.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And will those two
o-o
numbers always
o-o
add up to the
o-o
total number
o-o
of voters?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think so.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but what if
o-o
some voters rank
o-o
Pinoke and Oscar
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, that means
o-o
there will be
o-o
a third number.
o-o
The number of voters
o-o
who rank them
o-o
as equally
o-o
acceptable.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
o-o
Yes there are
o-o
three numbers
o-o
for each pairwise
o-o
comparison.
o-o
But when summarized,
o-o
the third count
o-o
can be omitted.
o-o
This means the
o-o
pairwise numbers
o-o
can be put into
o-o
a table, a square grid.
o-o
And each row
o-o
would be labelled
o-o
with the name
o-o
of a candidate.
o-o
And the columns
o-o
would be labelled
o-o
with the same
o-o
names in the same
o-o
sequence.
o-o
And each cell
o-o
would contain
o-o
a count.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So if the
o-o
candidates
o-o
are named
o-o
Pinoke, Oscar,
o-o
Barack, and
o-o
Hypatia,
o-o
it would be
o-o
a four by four
o-o
grid, right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
o-o
Now you're ready
o-o
to see the magic
o-o
of the counting
o-o
method I like
o-o
best.
o-o
It re hyphen-here arranges
o-o
the sequence of
o-o
candidates,
o-o
in the rows
o-o
and columns.
o-o
The goal is to
o-o
re hyphen-here arrange
o-o
the sequence
o-o
until the biggest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
upper hyphen-here right
o-o
triangular area
o-o
of the grid,
o-o
and the smallest
o-o
pairwise counts
o-o
move into the
o-o
other half,
o-o
the lower hyphen-here left
o-o
triangular area.
o-o
Then we look at
o-o
that sequence.
o-o
It indicates
o-o
not only who is
o-o
most popular,
o-o
but who is second
o-o
most popular,
o-o
who is third most
o-o
popular, and
o-o
so on down to
o-o
who is least
o-o
popular.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's that method
o-o
called?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The Condorcet
o-o
Kemeny
o-o
method.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That method
o-o
sounds more
o-o
convoluted
o-o
than building a
o-o
spiral staircase
o-o
down to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Maybe that's the
o-o
kind of math
o-o
your landlord
o-o
uses.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that the
o-o
fairest method?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Not always.
o-o
The very fairest
o-o
vote hyphen-here counting
o-o
system would be
o-o
even more complex.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So math
o-o
really is
o-o
the stairway
o-o
to hell.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do math
o-o
experts
o-o
even have
o-o
all the
o-o
answers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's a
o-o
mathematical
o-o
proof that proves
o-o
it's not possible
o-o
for there to be
o-o
a voting method
o-o
that has no flaws.
o-o
So it's complicated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Sounds like life and
o-o
relationships.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There are some
o-o
fairness
o-o
characteristics,
o-o
criteria,
o-o
that voting methods
o-o
pass or fail.
o-o
Math geeks know which
o-o
counting methods
o-o
can sometimes
o-o
fail which criteria.
o-o
But there has been
o-o
no research
o-o
to measure
o-o
how begin-italics often end-italics
o-o
each method fails,
o-o
or rather
o-o
passes,
o-o
each one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why hasn't that
o-o
research
o-o
been done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Who would pay for
o-o
a search
o-o
to find the
o-o
best
o-o
replacement?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoever pays
o-o
for research
o-o
about
o-o
dinosaurs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And
o-o
research in
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Most of that
o-o
funding comes from
o-o
the government.
o-o
Of course the
o-o
people who have
o-o
power
o-o
don't want to pay
o-o
for research
o-o
that reveals the
o-o
unfairness
o-o
that underpins
o-o
their power.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A black widow
o-o
spider's web of
o-o
corruption!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think we've
o-o
learned what's
o-o
needed.
o-o
Ranked hyphen-here choice ballots
o-o
and pairwise
o-o
counting.
o-o
So are we done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now math
o-o
is feeling like
o-o
a boa constrictor
o-o
wrapping around
o-o
my lungs.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Fight it off with
o-o
a deep breath.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-explain Takes a deep breath. end-explain
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a
o-o
foolish tactic
o-o
against a
o-o
boa constrictor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You're fighting
o-o
against fear.
o-o
This will be
o-o
easier.
o-o
So far we've
o-o
been talking
o-o
about how to
o-o
choose a
o-o
mayor,
o-o
governor,
o-o
or president
o-o
with fairness.
o-o
That's the first half.
o-o
But what happens
o-o
when there are
o-o
lots of seats
o-o
to fill,
o-o
like in
o-o
Congress?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Brain overload!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh right.
o-o
Instead, try this.
o-o
Imagine a
o-o
group of friends
o-o
eating together
o-o
and choosing
o-o
two pizzas.
o-o
If the majority
o-o
want a
o-o
pork sausage
o-o
topping,
o-o
and about
o-o
a third of
o-o
the friends are
o-o
Jewish,
o-o
how should the
o-o
topping
o-o
for the second
o-o
pizza
o-o
be chosen?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In the non hyphen-here math
o-o
verse,
o-o
they would start
o-o
a holy war.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Couldn't the
o-o
second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular
o-o
candidate,
o-o
er, topping,
o-o
be elected,
o-o
er,
o-o
selected?
o-o
For the second
o-o
pizza.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Second hyphen-here most
o-o
popular has
o-o
more than one
o-o
meaning.
o-o
So let's try
o-o
yet another
o-o
metaphor.
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
five wolves and
o-o
four sheep vote
o-o
on what to eat
o-o
for dinner.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ha! The five wolves
o-o
would eat the
o-o
four sheep!
o-o
And claim it's fair
o-o
because it's
o-o
democracy!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So us
o-o
minorities,
o-o
like the sheep,
o-o
need a way to
o-o
fight against a
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Bill of Rights
o-o
is nice,
o-o
but that's
o-o
not enough
o-o
to protect us
o-o
minorities
o-o
from white
o-o
supremacists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
As you see,
o-o
just getting a
o-o
majority
o-o
is just part of
o-o
the big picture.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought you were
o-o
showing us
o-o
everything on
o-o
a twelve hyphen-here foot
o-o
TV screen.
o-o
Where on the screen
o-o
should we
o-o
be looking?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see somethin'.
o-o
If districts
o-o
were filled with
o-o
wolves 'n sheep,
o-o
'n each district
o-o
had slightly more
o-o
wolves than sheep,
o-o
then every
o-o
district would
o-o
elect a wolf.
o-o
Then Congress would
o-o
be nothin' but wolves.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's not far from
o-o
what are now
o-o
mostly
o-o
white males.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In Europe,
o-o
instead of just
o-o
wolves and sheep,
o-o
they have a
o-o
handful of
o-o
political parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Like wolves and sheep
o-o
and goats and pigs?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sure.
o-o
On the ballot
o-o
each voter marks their
o-o
favorite
o-o
political party.
o-o
Let's say
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
mark their
o-o
ballot for
o-o
the Pirate
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'd join that one.
o-o
It sounds like
o-o
they're against
o-o
puppets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do they slash
o-o
puppet strings
o-o
with their
o-o
swords?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
They don't carry
o-o
swords,
o-o
or dress like
o-o
pirates.
o-o
But they do
o-o
oppose
o-o
what they think is
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Go pirates!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In some
o-o
European
o-o
countries,
o-o
adjustments
o-o
are done to
o-o
ensure the
o-o
Pirate party,
o-o
and every
o-o
other party,
o-o
gets their fair share
o-o
of seats in
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does that work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It hides the
o-o
unfairness of
o-o
still using
o-o
single hyphen-here choice ballots.
o-o
Yet lots of
o-o
people like it
o-o
because
o-o
it yields
o-o
what's called
o-o
begin-italics proportional
o-o
representation end-italics no-space .
o-o
So each voter
o-o
can point to
o-o
someone in
o-o
parliament
o-o
and claim their vote
o-o
helped elect
o-o
that MP,
o-o
er,
o-o
member of
o-o
parliament.
end-lyric
