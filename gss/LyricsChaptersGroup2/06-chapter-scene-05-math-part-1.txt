Hi
o-o
name-mathprof no-space .
o-o
This is name-damien no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof-firstuse amenn
Welcome name-desha
o-o
and name-damien no-space .
o-o
Welcome to
o-o
my classroom.
o-o
As we get settled
o-o
I'll ask you
o-o
name-damien no-space ,
o-o
do you like
o-o
pi?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien-firstuse amenn
I'll keep things real.
o-o
In the morning
o-o
pie seems so
o-o
irrational.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So you do like math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Already I'm confused.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
He doesn't know
o-o
about those
o-o
special meanings
o-o
for pi and
o-o
irrational,
o-o
and real,
o-o
in the
o-o
math world.
o-o
Just assume
o-o
he knows
o-o
as much
o-o
about math
o-o
as Mozart
o-o
knew about
o-o
...
o-o
electronics.
o-o
Plus he has
o-o
a phobia
o-o
about
o-o
fractions.
o-o
That's
o-o
name-damien no-space .
o-o
I don't know
o-o
if Mozart
o-o
had that fear.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Classrooms
o-o
are scary,
o-o
spooky, 'n
o-o
terrifyin'.
o-o
This one's bringin'
o-o
back awful
o-o
memories
o-o
of bein' teased
o-o
for gettin' Cs,
o-o
'n Ds,
o-o
'specially
o-o
in math 'n
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
I bet you're smart.
o-o
You just didn't
o-o
get a good start.
o-o
Can you count?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
One two three four
o-o
'n of course there's more.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Can you go
o-o
the other way?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Four three two one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What comes after
o-o
one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Nothin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a way you're
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for
o-o
bein' polite
o-o
in sayin' I'm wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
What's nothing called
o-o
in math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah yes, wonderful
o-o
magical zero!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's so special
o-o
'bout zero?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Zero as a digit
o-o
was not known in
o-o
ancient Egypt,
o-o
Babylon, Greece,
o-o
and Rome.
o-o
But in ancient
o-o
China they put
o-o
their counting marks
o-o
inside a square.
o-o
So when no marks
o-o
are there,
o-o
it's an empty
o-o
square.
o-o
That changed to
o-o
a circle as
o-o
the idea spread
o-o
to India then
o-o
Arabic-speaking
o-o
universities.
o-o
And then a student
o-o
took it to Rome
o-o
and became pope.
o-o

combee ************
Pope Sylvestor II aka Gerbert of Aurillac brought decimal notation and calculation procedures to Europe, and he became pope in year 999.
************ comenn

He could
o-o
calculate
o-o
faster than the
o-o
Italians who
o-o
still used
o-o
counting marks,
o-o
the ones we call
o-o
Roman numerals.
o-o
That's how the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
became part
o-o
of the Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's when
o-o
Leonardo
o-o
painted the
o-o
Mona Lisa,
o-o
and Michelangelo
o-o
carved the
o-o
rock hyphen-here hard
o-o
anatomy of
o-o
David.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lisa and David.
o-o
I think I've
o-o
heard about
o-o
those two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
With that
o-o
digit zero,
o-o
Portuguese
o-o
sailors made
o-o
realistic maps,
o-o
and navigated
o-o
far out into
o-o
the Atlantic.
o-o
They bumped into
o-o
Brazil,
o-o
where they found
o-o
food and water.
o-o
From there
o-o
they sailed
o-o
around the
o-o
southern tip
o-o
of Africa.
o-o
That bypassed
o-o
the north hyphen-here bound winds
o-o
along the
o-o
southwest
o-o
coast of
o-o
Africa.
o-o
And it
o-o
bypassed the
o-o
monopoly that
o-o
Arabic-speaking
o-o
Muslims had
o-o
on the land hyphen-here based
o-o
silk road to China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So it was
o-o
the digit zero,
o-o
not Columbus,
o-o
that got us
o-o
to North
o-o
and South
o-o
America?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes, in fact,
o-o
the Portuguese
o-o
discovered
o-o
Brazil before
o-o
fourteen ninety two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, so that's why
o-o
people in Brazil
o-o
speak Portuguese
o-o
instead of Spanish.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Interesting!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, zero's
o-o
a big hyphen-here deal number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
The digit zero.
o-o
Not just zero.
o-o
There have always
o-o
been words like
o-o
none, empty,
o-o
nobody,
o-o
ziltch, naked,
o-o
hungry, and
o-o
moron.
o-o
But writing
o-o
four zero zero
o-o
instead of
o-o
C C C C,
o-o
that's magic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the digit zero's
o-o
a big deal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Without it
o-o
bridges would
o-o
be filled with
o-o
long lines of
o-o
accountants
o-o
...
o-o
waiting for
o-o
their turn to
o-o
jump off.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Without it,
o-o
scientists
o-o
and engineers
o-o
couldn't have put
o-o
a man on the moon,
o-o
or put rovers
o-o
on the
o-o
planet Mars,
o-o
or photographed
o-o
the rings of Saturn
o-o
from within
o-o
those rings.
o-o
And those are just
o-o
a few of the things
o-o
that make
o-o
the digit zero
o-o
so incredibly
o-o
fantastic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think my
o-o
confusions
o-o
'bout zero
o-o
are gone.
o-o
But how's that
o-o
relate to
o-o
what happens
o-o
in gettin' fair
o-o
elections?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
There's something
o-o
in math that's
o-o
still very new.
o-o
It's not yet taught
o-o
in public schools.
o-o
Yet it can take
o-o
civilization,
o-o
humanity,
o-o
us,
o-o
to the next level
o-o
where elections
o-o
are fair.
o-o
But to get there
o-o
you need to
o-o
appreciate
o-o
the power of a
o-o
name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK, what's the name?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
A name without
o-o
it's meaning is
o-o
useless.
o-o
Concepts come first.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Every test I took
o-o
cared more about
o-o
the names than the
o-o
concepts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I learned to spell
o-o
begin-italics hypotenuse end-italics
o-o
before I learned
o-o
it had nothing
o-o
to do with
o-o
hippos.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's because names
o-o
and dates and such
o-o
are easier to test.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't that upside
o-o
down? Testin'
o-o
what's less
o-o
important?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You seem to me
o-o
to be quite
o-o
intelligent.
o-o
So let's
o-o
eliminate
o-o
your fear of
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there a
o-o
rattlesnake
o-o
cage or
o-o
fallin' tree
o-o
nearby?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
also disliked
o-o
fractions.
o-o
And so did
o-o
the Romans.
o-o
It's because
o-o
they lacked the
o-o
digit zero.
o-o
That's no big deal
o-o
for addition
o-o
and subtraction
o-o
and multiplication.
o-o
Those are just
o-o
shortcuts for
o-o
counting up,
o-o
counting down,
o-o
and a skipping
o-o
version of
o-o
counting up.
o-o
But division,
o-o
without the
o-o
big hyphen-here deal zero,
o-o
that's muddled and
o-o
befuddled
o-o
confusion.
o-o
So leaving
o-o
numbers as
o-o
fractions,
o-o
without doing the
o-o
division it
o-o
signifies,
o-o
that's what they did
o-o
until the
o-o
digit zero
o-o
arrived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now we've got
o-o
zero,
o-o
the digit.
o-o
Yet I've gotta
o-o
use fractions
o-o
every day.
o-o
It makes me
o-o
wacko to
o-o
add 'n subtract
o-o
those
o-o
...
o-o
suckers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If fractions you
o-o
loathe, then this
o-o
question I pose.
o-o
Why do you use them?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's part of
o-o
my job.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Are you a musician?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's music
o-o
got to do with
o-o
fractions?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Musicians
o-o
cannot avoid
o-o
fractions.
o-o
They count
o-o
by two, or three,
o-o
or four, or six,
o-o
or eight.
o-o
But not by
o-o
five or ten.
o-o
Except,
o-o
I suspect,
o-o
for some
o-o
geeky
o-o
modern
o-o
jazz.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now we know
o-o
Mozart wasn't
o-o
fraction
o-o
phobic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I build custom
o-o
staircases.
o-o
Tape measures
o-o
are marked in
o-o
halves, quarters,
o-o
eighths, 'n
o-o
sixteenths.
o-o
Those effin'
o-o
fractions.
o-o
I'd murder
o-o
those suckers
o-o
if I knew
o-o
where to aim.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use decimal numbers.
o-o
That's what the whole
o-o
world uses, as part of
o-o
the metric system.
o-o
Except of course
o-o
here in the states.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can't use
o-o
metric units.
o-o
That'd get
o-o
me fired.
o-o
Inches and feet
o-o
are required.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Decimal
o-o
numbers work
o-o
with inches too.
o-o
Just get a
o-o
tape measure with
o-o
decimal
o-o
markings for
o-o
inches!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, if only
o-o
I could do so.
o-o
That'd be great!
o-o
I could avoid
o-o
the fractions
o-o
I hate!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here, look at this
o-o
tape measure.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, it's marked
o-o
with ten units
o-o
per inch!
o-o
When I measure
o-o
I could write the
o-o
numbers as tenths
o-o
or hundredths.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
And adding and
o-o
subtracting them
o-o
is as easy as
o-o
dollars and cents.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This will
o-o
elevate
o-o
my joy when
o-o
making
o-o
staircases.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So a fraction
o-o
is a
o-o
division
o-o
problem
o-o
unfinished.
o-o
It's waiting
o-o
to get
o-o
diminished
o-o
to a single
o-o
number.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How do I get
o-o
a tape measure
o-o
like this?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Use the magic
o-o
math word
o-o
begin-italics decimal end-italics
o-o
when you search for
o-o
begin-italics tape measure end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
words can be
o-o
powerful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You learn fast!
o-o
Now about your
o-o
fear of
o-o
fractions.
o-o
Ancient Romans,
o-o
even though they
o-o
fearlessly
o-o
conquered most
o-o
Mediterranean
o-o
waterfront
o-o
property,
o-o
they too had
o-o
that fear.
o-o
They liked the
o-o
number twelve.
o-o
That's why sundials
o-o
have twelve marks
o-o
for the day.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So that's why we have
o-o
twenty four hours
o-o
per day?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Indeed.
o-o
The number twelve
o-o
can be divided
o-o
by two and three
o-o
and four and six,
o-o
and yield a nice
o-o
result of
o-o
six or four or
o-o
three or two.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wondered why
o-o
time is measured
o-o
in numbers that
o-o
aren't in
o-o
multiples
o-o
of ten.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sexagesimal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We're jumpin'
o-o
from fractions
o-o
to sex?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Using fractions
o-o
as foreplay
o-o
would solve
o-o
the world's
o-o
overpopulation
o-o
problem.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sexagesimal
o-o
is the name for
o-o
using sixty
o-o
as a base.
o-o
That's what the
o-o
ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
chose.
o-o
Sixty divides
o-o
without remainders
o-o
by two and three and
o-o
four and five and six
o-o
and ten and twelve
o-o
and fifteen and twenty
o-o
and thirty.
o-o
That's why an hour
o-o
has sixty minutes.
o-o
And why a minute
o-o
has sixty seconds.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So we could ditch
o-o
fractions?
o-o
That's a world
o-o
I'd like to see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So are fractions
o-o
a bit less
o-o
scary?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
my fraction
o-o
phobia's
o-o
takin'
o-o
a siesta.
o-o
But sometimes
o-o
I get stuck
o-o
not knowing when
o-o
to do division,
o-o
in the right
o-o
sequence with
o-o
addition 'n
o-o
subtraction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's just the trick
o-o
of algebra.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear lord
o-o
please forget
o-o
I said that!
o-o
From what I've heard,
o-o
algebra's
o-o
the fifth horseman
o-o
of the apocalypse.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Albert Einstein,
o-o
when he was young,
o-o
also had trouble
o-o
with algebra.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But he was a
o-o
genius.
o-o
And best known
o-o
for E equals
o-o
M C squared,
o-o
the ultimate
o-o
celebrity
o-o
math equation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He struggled
o-o
until his
o-o
uncle told him
o-o
to think of
o-o
algebra as
o-o
a whodunnit
o-o
mystery.
o-o
Where the
o-o
identity
o-o
of mister X
o-o
is unknown, and
o-o
the facts are clues,
o-o
and the goal is
o-o
to figure out
o-o
who is mister X?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Why didn't my
o-o
algebra teacher
o-o
teach that trick?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Because donning
o-o
a Sherlock Holmes
o-o
cap in class
o-o
would get you sent
o-o
to the principal's
o-o
office.
o-o
And writing
o-o
begin-italics whodunnit end-italics
o-o
on a
o-o
standardized
o-o
test would
o-o
get you sent to
o-o
the circus
o-o
as a clown.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, I think
o-o
I'm seein'
o-o
your point.
o-o
Division
o-o
asks the question:
o-o
begin-italics What number
o-o
needs to be
o-o
multiplied
o-o
times the number
o-o
on the bottom
o-o
of a fraction
o-o
to get the
o-o
number on the
o-o
top of the
o-o
fraction? end-italics
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes!
o-o
Excellent!
o-o
Now you
o-o
understand
o-o
some key ideas
o-o
of math.
o-o
Not enough
o-o
for me to
o-o
be inclined
o-o
to drive over
o-o
a bridge you
o-o
designed.
o-o
There's lots more.
o-o
And yet,
o-o
so much of it
o-o
would make sense
o-o
if math history
o-o
were taught
o-o
with a
o-o
focus on
o-o
concepts.
o-o
It even explains
o-o
why we say
o-o
fourteen and
o-o
thirteen but not
o-o
two hyphen-here teen
o-o
and one hyphen-here teen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I suppose
o-o
this explains
o-o
why hotel
o-o
elevators
o-o
can't count to
o-o
thirteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I sure feel
o-o
unlucky
o-o
when I'm stuck with
o-o
a measurement
o-o
of thirteen
o-o
instead of
o-o
twelve 'n have to
o-o
divide it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here's another
o-o
useful secret.
o-o
Division is
o-o
disguised under
o-o
other names.
o-o
Like ratio,
o-o
rate,
o-o
proportion,
o-o
average,
o-o
percentage,
o-o
percent, and
o-o
the word per.
o-o
And of course
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So a fraction's
o-o
just a lazy
o-o
way to deal with
o-o
division?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It sounds like we
o-o
need a revolution
o-o
in how math is taught.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another revolution?
o-o
How many do you want?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As many as it takes
o-o
to get things
o-o
right side up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh I do wish
o-o
there was more time
o-o
so we could talk
o-o
about beautiful
o-o
balanced equations,
o-o
and what's behind
o-o
calculus, and
o-o
why quadratic equations
o-o
....
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Fortunately
o-o
we don't have
o-o
that much time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course,
o-o
of course!
o-o
And anyway,
o-o
computers can do
o-o
math better than
o-o
students.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute!
o-o
Math textbooks
o-o
and math professors
o-o
are teaching us
o-o
thinking skills
o-o
that computers
o-o
can easily handle?
o-o
Why is that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ironic isn't it?
o-o
Computers are better
o-o
than humans
o-o
at spelling,
o-o
grammar,
o-o
arithmetic,
o-o
algebra,
o-o
trigonometry,
o-o
calculus,
o-o
historical facts,
o-o
geography,
o-o
map reading, and
o-o
diplomatically
o-o
insulting you
o-o
for missing a
o-o
right turn.
o-o
Yet we try to teach
o-o
all that in school.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What're computers
o-o
not good at doing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Inventing,
o-o
creating new
o-o
solutions to
o-o
real hyphen-here life
o-o
problems,
o-o
writing books
o-o
worth reading,
o-o
composing
o-o
beautiful music,
o-o
scripting videos
o-o
worth watching,
o-o
graphic design,
o-o
software development,
o-o
extracting meaning
o-o
from data,
o-o
hiring
o-o
decisions,
o-o
speed dating,
o-o
I mean
o-o
matchmaking,
o-o
and,
o-o
so far,
o-o
cooking.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Would that include
o-o
designing
o-o
custom staircases?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those are the skills
o-o
that employers
o-o
desire.
o-o
My boss says
o-o
it's hard to hire
o-o
workers who
o-o
can do much more
o-o
than loiter
o-o
in the general
o-o
vicinity
o-o
of a staircase.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So schools teach
o-o
what computers
o-o
can do better?
o-o
And schools fail
o-o
to teach the skills
o-o
that computers
o-o
are not good at,
o-o
but that
o-o
businesses
o-o
really want?
o-o
Wow!
o-o
The academic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
the
o-o
academic
o-o
world,
o-o
the one based on
o-o
standardized tests,
o-o
is upside down
o-o
for students
o-o
and teachers
o-o
and employers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No wonder I often
o-o
recall so little
o-o
of what I learned
o-o
in college.
o-o
Computers
o-o
do it better.
o-o
We really ought
o-o
to have a
o-o
revolution
o-o
in how math,
o-o
and more,
o-o
is taught.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Computers
o-o
lack the ability
o-o
to understand
o-o
concepts.
o-o
Yet too often
o-o
that's what
o-o
academia
o-o
fails to teach.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So schools
o-o
deserve a
o-o
failing grade!
o-o
I love it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitions,
o-o
terminology,
o-o
memorization
o-o
of facts,
o-o
grammar rules,
o-o
math rules,
o-o
etcetera
o-o
are what professors
o-o
teach because
o-o
textbooks focus
o-o
on them.
o-o
And standardized
o-o
tests test
o-o
those things.
o-o
But really it's
o-o
the concepts
o-o
that schools
o-o
most need
o-o
to teach.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So schools are
o-o
trying to
o-o
begin-italics program end-italics students,
o-o
as if we were
o-o
computers.
o-o
While businesses
o-o
are trying to
o-o
begin-italics teach end-italics computers
o-o
how to think
o-o
like humans.
o-o
They're both
o-o
as stupid as
o-o
someone who
o-o
tries to stand up
o-o
in a hammock.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
it's like someone
o-o
who gargles
o-o
instead of drinks
o-o
at the fountain
o-o
of knowledge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of which,
o-o
now can we switch
o-o
to politics
o-o
from just
o-o
mathematics?
o-o
I'm eager
o-o
to learn the
o-o
math behind
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you're ready.
o-o
You won't be scared
o-o
when zero
o-o
pops up.
o-o
And only one
o-o
very simple
o-o
fraction
o-o
is involved.
o-o
The one called
o-o
half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hurray!
o-o
Even a half wit
o-o
like me
o-o
can handle
o-o
a half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's one
o-o
divided
o-o
by two.
o-o
That equals
o-o
zero point five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or fifty
o-o
percent.
o-o
Now you're ready!
o-o
So let's explore
o-o
how votes need to
o-o
be counted for
o-o
results to be
o-o
fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
