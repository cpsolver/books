ambee sings-damien amenn
We're jumpin'
o-o
from fractions
o-o
to sex?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Using fractions
o-o
as foreplay
o-o
would solve
o-o
the world's
o-o
overpopulation
o-o
problem.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sexagesimal
o-o
is the name for
o-o
using sixty
o-o
as a base.
sentence-next
o-o
The ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
made that choice
o-o
to avoid
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now it's clear
o-o
why an hour has
o-o
sixty minutes
o-o
and a
o-o
minute has
o-o
sixty seconds.
sentence-next
o-o
That was done
o-o
to avoid
o-o
fractions!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sixty divides
o-o
without remainders
o-o
by two and three and
o-o
four and five and six
o-o
and ten and twelve
o-o
and fifteen and twenty
o-o
and thirty.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So we could ditch
o-o
fractions?
sentence-next
o-o
That's a world
o-o
I'd like to see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So are fractions
o-o
a bit less
o-o
scary?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
my fraction
o-o
phobia's
o-o
takin'
o-o
a siesta.
sentence-next
o-o
But sometimes
o-o
I get stuck
o-o
not knowing when
o-o
to do division,
o-o
in the right
o-o
sequence with
o-o
addition 'n
o-o
subtraction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's just the trick
o-o
of algebra.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear lord
o-o
please forget
o-o
I said that!
sentence-next
o-o
From what I've heard,
o-o
learning
o-o
algebra
o-o
is as dark
o-o
as the path to
o-o
Mount Doom.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Albert Einstein,
o-o
when he was young,
o-o
also had trouble
o-o
with algebra.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
But he was a

genius.
sentence-next
o-o
And best known
o-o
for E equals
o-o
M C squared,
o-o
the ultimate
o-o
celebrity
o-o
math equation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
He struggled
o-o
until his
o-o
uncle told him
o-o
to think of
o-o
algebra as
o-o
a whodunnit
o-o
mystery.
sentence-next
o-o
Where the
o-o
identity
o-o
of mister X
o-o
is unknown, and
o-o
the facts are clues,
o-o
and the goal is
o-o
to figure out
o-o
who is mister X?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Why didn't my
o-o
algebra teacher
o-o
teach that trick?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Because donning
o-o
a Sherlock Holmes
o-o
cap in class
o-o
would get you sent
o-o
to the principal's
o-o
office.
sentence-next
o-o
And writing
o-o
begin-italics whodunnit end-italics
o-o
on a
o-o
standardized
o-o
test would
o-o
get you sent to
o-o
the circus
o-o
as a clown.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, I think
o-o
I'm seein'
o-o
your point.
sentence-next
o-o
Division
o-o
asks the question:
o-o
begin-italics What number
o-o
needs to be
o-o
multiplied
o-o
times the number
o-o
on the bottom
o-o
of a fraction
o-o
to get the
o-o
number on the
o-o
top of the

fraction? end-italics
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes!
sentence-next
o-o
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Now you
o-o
understand
o-o
some key ideas
o-o
of math.
sentence-next
o-o
Not enough
o-o
for me to
o-o
be inclined
o-o
to drive over
o-o
a bridge you
o-o
designed.
sentence-next
o-o
There's lots more.
sentence-next
o-o
And yet,
o-o
so much of it
o-o
would make sense
o-o
if math history
o-o
were taught
o-o
with a
o-o
focus on
o-o
concepts.
sentence-next
o-o
It even explains
o-o
why we say
o-o
fourteen and
o-o
thirteen but not
o-o
two hyphen-here teen
o-o
and one hyphen-here teen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I suppose
o-o
this explains
o-o
why hotel
o-o
elevators
o-o
can't count to
o-o
thirteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I sure feel
o-o
unlucky
o-o
when I'm stuck with
o-o
a measurement
o-o
of thirteen
o-o
instead of
o-o
twelve 'n have to
o-o
divide it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here's another
o-o
useful secret.
sentence-next
o-o
Division is
o-o
disguised under
o-o
other names.
sentence-next
o-o
Like ratio,
o-o
rate,
o-o
proportion,
o-o
average,
o-o
percentage,
o-o
percent, and
o-o
the word per.
sentence-next
o-o
And of course
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So a fraction's
o-o
just a lazy
o-o
way to deal with
o-o
division?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You've got it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It sounds like we
o-o
need a revolution
o-o
in how math is taught.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Another revolution?
sentence-next
o-o
How many do you want?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As many as it takes
o-o
to get things
o-o
right side up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Oh I do wish
o-o
there was more time
o-o
so we could talk
o-o
about beautiful
o-o
balanced equations,
o-o
and what's behind
o-o
calculus, and
o-o
why quadratic equations
o-o
....
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Fortunately
o-o
we don't have
o-o
that much time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Of course,
o-o
of course!
sentence-next
o-o
And anyway,
o-o
computers can do
o-o
math better than
o-o
students.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute!
sentence-next
o-o
Math textbooks
o-o
and math professors
o-o
are teaching us
o-o
thinking skills
o-o
that computers
o-o
can easily handle?
sentence-next
o-o
Why is that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ironic isn't it?
sentence-next
o-o
Computers are better
o-o
than humans
o-o
at spelling,
o-o
grammar,
o-o
arithmetic,
o-o
algebra,
o-o
trigonometry,
o-o
calculus,
o-o
history,
o-o
geography,
o-o
flying
o-o
airplanes,
o-o
and
o-o
diplomatically
o-o
insulting you
o-o
for missing a
o-o
right turn.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet we
o-o
try to teach
o-o
most of that
o-o
in school.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What're computers
o-o
not good at doing?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Inventing,
o-o
creating new
o-o
solutions to
o-o
real hyphen-here life
o-o
problems,
o-o
writing books
o-o
worth reading,
o-o
scripting videos
o-o
worth watching,
o-o
composing
o-o
beautiful music,
o-o
finding soulmates,
o-o
managing
o-o
employees,
o-o
and,
o-o
so far,
o-o
peeling oranges.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Would that include
o-o
designing
o-o
custom staircases?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitely.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those are the skills
o-o
that employers
o-o
desire.
sentence-next
o-o
My boss says
o-o
it's hard to hire
o-o
workers who
o-o
can do much more
o-o
than loiter
o-o
in the general
o-o
vicinity
o-o
of a staircase.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So schools teach
o-o
what computers
o-o
can do better?
sentence-next
o-o
And schools fail
o-o
to teach the skills
o-o
that computers
o-o
are not good at,
o-o
but that
o-o
businesses
o-o
really want?
sentence-next
o-o
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
The academic
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
the
o-o
academic
o-o
world,
o-o
the one based on
o-o
standardized tests,
o-o
is upside down
o-o
for students
o-o
and teachers
o-o
and employers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No wonder I often
o-o
recall so little
o-o
of what I learned
o-o
in college.
sentence-next
o-o
Computers
o-o
do it better.
sentence-next
o-o
We really ought
o-o
to have a
o-o
revolution
o-o
in how math,
o-o
and more,
o-o
is taught.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Computers
o-o
lack the ability
o-o
to understand
o-o
concepts.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet too often
o-o
that's what
o-o
academia
o-o
fails to teach.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So schools
o-o
deserve a
o-o
failing grade!
sentence-next
o-o
I love it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Definitions,
o-o
terminology,
o-o
memorization
o-o
of facts,
o-o
grammar rules,
o-o
math rules,
o-o
etcetera
o-o
are what professors
o-o
teach because
o-o
textbooks focus
o-o
on them.
sentence-next
o-o
And standardized
o-o
tests test
o-o
those things.
sentence-next
o-o
But really it's
o-o
the concepts
o-o
that schools
o-o
most need
o-o
to teach.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So schools are
o-o
trying to
o-o
begin-italics program end-italics students,
o-o
as if we were
o-o
computers.
sentence-next
o-o
While businesses
o-o
are trying to
o-o
begin-italics teach end-italics computers
o-o
how to think
o-o
like humans.
sentence-next
o-o
They're both
o-o
as stupid as
o-o
someone who
o-o
tries to stand up
o-o
in a hammock.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
it's like someone
o-o
who gargles
o-o
instead of drinks
o-o
at the fountain
o-o
of knowledge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of which,
o-o
now can we switch
o-o
to politics
o-o
from just
o-o
mathematics?
sentence-next
o-o
Now,
o-o
I'm shocked
o-o
to say,
o-o
I'm eager
o-o
to learn the
o-o
math behind
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
You won't be scared
o-o
when zero
o-o
pops up.
sentence-next
o-o
And only one
o-o
very simple
o-o
fraction
o-o
is involved.
sentence-next
o-o
The one called
o-o
half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hurray!
sentence-next
o-o
Even a half wit
o-o
like me
o-o
can handle
o-o
a half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's one
o-o
divided
o-o
by two.
sentence-next
o-o
That equals
o-o
zero point five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or fifty
o-o
percent.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're ready!
sentence-next
o-o
So let's explore
o-o
how votes need to
o-o
be counted for
o-o
results to be
o-o
fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So how do you think
o-o
voting should be done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As you know,
o-o
I'm not a

math wiz.
sentence-next
o-o
Or even a nerd.

name-damien no-space ?

...
sentence-next
o-o
I reckon,
o-o

it might use

o-o
five stars?

...
sentence-next
o-o
Like
o-o
Amazon does?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a good start.
sentence-next
o-o
And why is that
o-o
approach smart?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If Amazon used
o-o
just one star
o-o
for each product,
o-o
like on an
o-o
'lection ballot,
o-o
that wouldn't be
o-o
enough info.
sentence-next
o-o
So what's needed
o-o
in elections
o-o
is more
o-o
info.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes indeed!
sentence-next
o-o
So if stars were
o-o
used in elections,
o-o
and the highest
o-o
count of stars
o-o
indicated
o-o
the winner,
o-o
how could you,

o-o
get some extra
