Sexagesimal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We're jumpin'
o-o
from fractions
o-o
to sex?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Speaking of
o-o
fractions
o-o
during a
o-o
passionate
o-o
embrace
o-o
would solve
o-o
the world's
o-o
overpopulation
o-o
crisis.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Sexagesimal
o-o
is the name for
o-o
using sixty
o-o
as a base.
sentence-next
o-o
The ancient
o-o
Babylonians
o-o
made that choice
o-o
to avoid
o-o
fractions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
an hour has
o-o
sixty minutes
o-o
and a
o-o
minute has
o-o
sixty seconds.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That avoids
o-o
fractions
o-o
because
o-o
sixty divides
o-o
without remainders
o-o
by two and three and
o-o
four and five and six
o-o
and ten and twelve
o-o
and fifteen and twenty
o-o
and thirty.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So we can
o-o
abandon
o-o
fractions?
sentence-next
o-o
Let's do it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Are fractions
o-o
a bit
o-o
less creepy
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Indeed,
o-o
now that I know
o-o
it's just
o-o
a lazy way
o-o
to do
o-o
division.
sentence-next
o-o
And a sneaky
o-o
way to hide
o-o
the word
o-o
division.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Here's another
o-o
useful tip.
sentence-next
o-o
Division
o-o
is often
o-o
disguised
o-o
with other words
o-o
like ratio,
o-o
rate,
o-o
proportion,
o-o
average,
o-o
percentage,
o-o
percent, and
o-o
the word per.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I wish you'd
o-o
been able to
o-o
teach me this stuff
o-o
when I was in
o-o
your class.
sentence-next
o-o
Along with
o-o
why thirteen
o-o
gained its
o-o
reputation
o-o
for being
o-o
unlucky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas.
sentence-next
o-o
We have to teach
o-o
what's in
o-o
textbooks,
o-o
and what's
o-o
on standardized
o-o
exams.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute.
sentence-next
o-o
It's almost like
o-o
schools are
o-o
trying to
o-o
begin-italics program end-italics students,
o-o
as if we were
o-o
computers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
At the same time
o-o
businesses
o-o
are trying to
o-o
begin-italics teach end-italics computers
o-o
how to think
o-o
like humans.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Both of those
o-o
are as stupid
o-o
as someone
o-o
who tries
o-o
to stand up
o-o
in a hammock.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think schools
o-o
deserve a
o-o
failing grade.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
it's like someone
o-o
who gargles
o-o
instead of drinks
o-o
at the fountain
o-o
of knowledge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of which,
o-o
now can we switch
o-o
to politics
o-o
from just
o-o
mathematics?
sentence-next
o-o
Now,
o-o
I'm shocked
o-o
to say,
o-o
I'm eager
o-o
to learn the
o-o
math behind
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
You won't be scared
o-o
when zero
o-o
pops up.
sentence-next
o-o
And only one
o-o
very simple
o-o
fraction
o-o
is involved.
sentence-next
o-o
The one called
o-o
half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hurray!
sentence-next
o-o
Even a half wit
o-o
like me
o-o
can handle
o-o
a half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's one
o-o
divided
o-o
by two.
sentence-next
o-o
That equals
o-o
zero point five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or fifty
o-o
percent.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're ready!
sentence-next
o-o
So let's explore
o-o
how votes need to
o-o
be counted for
o-o
results to be
o-o
fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So how do you think
o-o
voting should be done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As you know,
o-o
I'm not a
o-o
math wiz.
sentence-next
o-o
Or even a nerd.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
name-damien no-space ?
sentence-next
o-o
What do you
o-o
suppose
o-o
that would
o-o
look like?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Uh,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
I reckon,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
maybe
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
it might use
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
five stars?
sentence-next
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
Like
o-o
Amazon does?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a good start.
sentence-next
o-o
And why is that
o-o
approach smart?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If Amazon used
o-o
just one star
o-o
for each product,
o-o
like on an
o-o
'lection ballot,
o-o
that wouldn't be
o-o
enough info.
sentence-next
o-o
So what's needed
o-o
in elections
o-o
is more
o-o
info.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes indeed!
sentence-next
o-o
So if stars were
o-o
used in elections,
o-o
and the highest
o-o
count of stars
o-o
indicated
o-o
the winner,
o-o
how could you,
o-o
as a voter,
o-o
get some extra
o-o
influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm feelin'
o-o
like a dunce.
