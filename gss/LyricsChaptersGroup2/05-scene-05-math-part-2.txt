ambee sings-damien amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I know
o-o
fractions
o-o
are just
o-o
a lazy way
o-o
to handle
o-o
division.
sentence-next
o-o
And a sneaky
o-o
way to hide
o-o
division
o-o
behind a
o-o
disguise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Other words
o-o
that disguise
o-o
division
o-o
are the words
o-o
ratio,
o-o
rate,
o-o
proportion,
o-o
average,
o-o
percentage,
o-o
percent, and
o-o
the word per.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I wish my
o-o
elementary
o-o
teachers
o-o
long ago
o-o
had taught
o-o
these concepts
o-o
so quickly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas.
sentence-next
o-o
We have to teach
o-o
what's in
o-o
textbooks,
o-o
and what's
o-o
on standardized
o-o
exams.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's as if
o-o
schools
o-o
try to
o-o
begin-italics program end-italics students,
o-o
as if we were
o-o
computers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Meanwhile,
o-o
in the world of
o-o
business,
o-o
they keep trying
o-o
to fire workers
o-o
by putting
o-o
artificial
o-o
intelligence
o-o
into computers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Programming
o-o
students
o-o
and putting
o-o
intelligence
o-o
into computers
o-o
are both
o-o
as stupid
o-o
as someone
o-o
who tries
o-o
to stand up
o-o
in a hammock.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I agree.
sentence-next
o-o
I think
o-o
this means
o-o
schools
o-o
deserve a
o-o
failing grade!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I love it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Alas,
o-o
sometimes our
o-o
education
o-o
system
o-o
does seem to
o-o
teach kids
o-o
to gargle
o-o
instead of drink
o-o
at the fountain
o-o
of knowledge.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of which,
o-o
now can we switch
o-o
to politics
o-o
from just
o-o
mathematics?
sentence-next
o-o
Now,
o-o
I'm shocked
o-o
to say,
o-o
I'm eager
o-o
to learn the
o-o
math behind
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Now you're ready.
sentence-next
o-o
You won't be scared
o-o
when zero
o-o
appears.
sentence-next
o-o
And only one
o-o
very simple
o-o
fraction
o-o
is involved.
sentence-next
o-o
The one called
o-o
half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hurray!
sentence-next
o-o
Even a half wit
o-o
like me
o-o
can handle
o-o
a half.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's one
o-o
divided
o-o
by two.
sentence-next
o-o
That equals
o-o
zero point five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Or fifty
o-o
percent.
sentence-next
o-o
Now you're ready!
sentence-next
o-o
So let's explore
o-o
how votes need to
o-o
be counted for
o-o
results to be
o-o
fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Finally!
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
So how do you think
o-o
voting should be done?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
As you know,
o-o
I'm not a
o-o
math wiz.
sentence-next
o-o
Or even a nerd.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
name-damien no-space ?
sentence-next
o-o
What do you
o-o
suppose
o-o
that would
o-o
look like?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Uh,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
I reckon,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
maybe
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
it might use
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
five stars?
sentence-next
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
Like
o-o
Amazon does?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
That's a good start.
sentence-next
o-o
And why is that
o-o
approach smart?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If Amazon used
o-o
just one star
o-o
for each product,
o-o
like on an
o-o
'lection ballot,
o-o
that wouldn't be
o-o
enough info.
sentence-next
o-o
So what's needed
o-o
in elections
o-o
is more
o-o
info.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Excellent!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes indeed!
sentence-next
o-o
So if stars were
o-o
used in elections,
o-o
and the highest
o-o
count of stars
o-o
indicated
o-o
the winner,
o-o
how could you,
o-o
as a voter,
o-o
get some extra
o-o
influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm feelin'
o-o
like a dunce.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Let's try a
o-o
different
o-o
scenario.
sentence-next
o-o
Let's suppose
o-o
you're in the
o-o
audience at
o-o
a talent contest,
o-o
and the emcee
o-o
announces
o-o
the loudness
o-o
of clapping
o-o
will determine
o-o
who wins.
sentence-next
o-o
How can you get
o-o
extra influence?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nor do I.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
You could clap
o-o
really loud for
o-o
your favorites,
o-o
and just pretend
o-o
to clap for the
o-o
others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd be
o-o
cheating.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
In a talent
o-o
contest, maybe,
o-o
maybe not.
sentence-next
o-o
At theater
o-o
events, that's
o-o
disrespectful.
sentence-next
o-o
But in an
o-o
election, with
o-o
money on the line,
o-o
that's just freedom
o-o
of expression.
sentence-next
o-o
It's voting,
o-o
but with an unfair
o-o
kind of vote
o-o
counting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, it's fighting!
sentence-next
o-o
Done on ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So when I rate
o-o
things on Amazon
o-o
I should only
o-o
use one star
o-o
or five stars?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
If you do that
o-o
on Amazon
o-o
you're being a
o-o
jerk.
sentence-next
o-o
But if that star
o-o
rating were used
o-o
in elections,
o-o
where so much
o-o
is at stake,
o-o
that tactic
o-o
would make
o-o
your ballot
o-o
have more impact
o-o
than ballots
o-o
marked
o-o
honestly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm still following
o-o
things to here.
sentence-next
o-o
Too bad I can't
o-o
celebrate with
o-o
a beer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Bravo!
sentence-next
o-o
You see that
o-o
just collecting
o-o
more information
o-o
isn't enough.
sentence-next
o-o
How the information
o-o
is counted to
o-o
identify a
o-o
winner is so
o-o
important to
o-o
get right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the five star
o-o
method won't work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Ah,
o-o
I should
o-o
shine light
o-o
on the concept
o-o
that there are
o-o
two parts
o-o
to any
o-o
voting method.
sentence-next
o-o
There's the ballot
o-o
and there's the
o-o
counting of those
o-o
ballots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What kind'a ballot
o-o
do we use
o-o
now?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Almost
o-o
every nation in the
o-o
world uses what's
o-o
increasingly called
o-o
the single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'Cause we can
o-o
only mark a
o-o
single choice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Right.
sentence-next
o-o
And in a
o-o
simple election
o-o
there's just
o-o
one way
o-o
to count
o-o
that kind
o-o
of ballot.
sentence-next
o-o
Which is why
o-o
until recently
o-o
that ballot didn't
o-o
have a name.
sentence-next
o-o
The counting method
o-o
has different names.
sentence-next
o-o
It's the enemy
o-o
of fair voting
o-o
so it's worth
o-o
learning its names.
sentence-next
o-o
In the academic
o-o
world it's called
o-o
begin-italics plurality voting end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
In Canada
o-o
and other
o-o
British places
o-o
it's called
o-o
begin-italics first past the post end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it called
o-o
here in the states?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
It's just called
o-o
voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah! With no name
o-o
it becomes harder
o-o
to fight against!
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine protesting
o-o
with a sign that says
o-o
begin-italics End That Nameless
o-o
Bad Kind Of
o-o
Vote Counting end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that's the
o-o
enemy?
sentence-next
o-o
Plurality?
sentence-next
o-o
And it uses
o-o
the
o-o
single hyphen-here choice
o-o
ballot?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Using those for
o-o
democracy
o-o
is like
o-o
using a stick
o-o
attached to
o-o
a round piece of
o-o
cardboard
o-o
as an
o-o
umbrella.
sentence-next
o-o
It works
o-o
for a bit,
o-o
until it
o-o
doesn't.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So what's the name
o-o
of a ballot where
o-o
each candidate
o-o
can be ranked at
o-o
a different level,
o-o
like on Amazon?
end-lyric

ambee sings-mathprof amenn
Academically
o-o
that's called a
o-o
ranked ballot,
o-o
or a score ballot,
o-o
depending on
o-o
how it's counted.
end-lyric
