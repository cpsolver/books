Come into my

o-o
and pardon
o-o
the mess.
o-o
I keep hearing

promises

o-o
that someone

this all up.
o-o
Alas,
o-o
it was hit by

a fresh tomato.
o-o
I mean

tornado.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I knew
o-o
politics
o-o
was messy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
While I'm looking
o-o
for bugs,
o-o
would you like
o-o
some cold pizza?
o-o
The sausage
o-o
is pork.

ambee sings-damien amenn
Not if that's where
o-o
the bugs have been
o-o
holdin' their
o-o
rallies.
o-o
'N the cheeze
o-o
looks more

end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Oh man,
o-o
not those
o-o
kinds of bugs.
o-o
We politicians
o-o
need to keep
o-o
our secrets

...
o-o
from

political

spies.
o-o
In fact,
o-o
turn off

kinds of magic

that we use on

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What a treat!
o-o
A wise sage!
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Of course
o-o
you realize
o-o
we have to
o-o
tell lies
o-o
...
o-o
to voters.
o-o
If we told
o-o
the dumb voters
o-o
what we tell
o-o
our rich donors,
o-o
we'd never win
o-o
our prize,
o-o
re hyphen-here election.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I suspect
o-o
your donors
o-o
don't forget
o-o
your promises.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Indeed they don't.
o-o
They hire
o-o
lobbyists
o-o
to keep track
o-o
of us.
o-o
And they make
o-o
such a fuss
o-o
if we just
o-o
vote for a bill
o-o
that might drop
o-o
their gross income
o-o
by the price of
o-o
one chocolate mousse.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That is gross.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yet the biggest
o-o
political
o-o
trick isn't
o-o
deceipt.
o-o
It's distraction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You've got my full
o-o
attention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
As you know
o-o
there are names
o-o
for the left
o-o
and the right.
o-o
Names like
o-o
liberals,
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
capitalists,
o-o
workers, and
o-o
environmentalists.
o-o
And there's
o-o
name hyphen-here calling.
o-o
Names like
o-o
tree huggers,
o-o
socialists,
o-o
racists,
o-o
and dimwits.
o-o
Those
o-o
left hyphen-here and hyphen-here right names
o-o
entertainingly
o-o
distract
o-o
from the fact
o-o
that there's a
o-o
bigger
o-o
conflict.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's bigger than
o-o
the fight
o-o
between left 'n
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Allow me to
o-o
introduce you
o-o
to a new way
o-o
to view the
o-o
political
o-o
terrain.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My brain
o-o
is open wide
o-o
'n ready to be
o-o
stupified.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
The much bigger
o-o
fight is
o-o
between the
o-o
political up
o-o
and the
o-o
political down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Political up?
o-o
Political down?
o-o
Where did
o-o
left and right
o-o
go to?
o-o
What's up?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
The political up,
o-o
that's where most
o-o
voters are.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voters of which
o-o
party?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Both parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How can that be?
o-o
Both Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
are in the
o-o
political up?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Stop thinking of
o-o
voters as
o-o
Republicans
o-o
and
o-o
Democrats.
o-o
It's us
o-o
politicians,
o-o
and the party
o-o
insiders,
o-o
who are
o-o
Republicans
o-o
and
o-o
Democrats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So is this like
o-o
Star begin-italics Wars end-italics fans
o-o
also can be
o-o
Star begin-italics Trek end-italics
o-o
fans?
o-o
And the
o-o
opposite?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Heck,
o-o
if this is news
o-o
to you,
o-o
maybe you too
o-o
have failed to
o-o
recognize
o-o
that both
o-o
parties are
o-o
controlled by
o-o
people who
o-o
utilize
o-o
money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That part I knew.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
The biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The biggest
o-o
contributors?
o-o
Should we
o-o
be puttin' down
o-o
fat people?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not that kind
o-o
of biggest.
o-o
They give the
o-o
biggest amounts
o-o
of money.
o-o
They provide
o-o
the money source
o-o
that lifts us
o-o
politicians
o-o
high in the polls.
o-o
They've bought
o-o
our souls.
o-o
Without their dough
o-o
we get dashed
o-o
against the rocks
o-o
during a
o-o
primary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You're talkin' 'bout
o-o
rich folks,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Of course they're
o-o
all rich.
o-o
But some
o-o
of the rich
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How can that be?
o-o
I'm as confused
o-o
as if I just
o-o
stepped out from an
o-o
industrial
o-o
laundry
o-o
washer
o-o
during the
o-o
high hyphen-here spin
o-o
cycle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Confused by
o-o
the spin.
o-o
That's the state
o-o
most voters
o-o
are in.
o-o
That's the aim
o-o
of the
o-o
political
o-o
down.
o-o
So of course
o-o
they resist
o-o
adopting
o-o
a name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But among themselves
o-o
they call themselves
o-o
the political down?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
No, that's just
o-o
how I think of
o-o
them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This
o-o
upfront
o-o
lowdown is
o-o
blindingly
o-o
illuminatin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Of course
o-o
lots of wealthy
o-o
folks in the
o-o
political down
o-o
prefer our party,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Even I can see that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yet many people
o-o
in the
o-o
political down
o-o
have infiltrated
o-o
the Democratic
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting in both parties?
o-o
That's illegal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You're thinking of votes.
o-o
I'm talking about money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoa!
o-o
How come the
o-o
political
o-o
down
o-o
gives money
o-o
to both
o-o
left and right
o-o
parties?
o-o
That's as stupid
o-o
as placin' bets
o-o
on both horses
o-o
in a
o-o
two hyphen-here horse race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Ah, here's a
o-o
big secret.
o-o
They assist
o-o
horses,
o-o
er, candidates,
o-o
in their
o-o
disliked
o-o
party
o-o
only during
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
elections.
o-o
Of course I'm
o-o
dumbing things down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That fits my brain.
o-o
Now I see!
o-o
They use money
o-o
to influence
o-o
who wins each
o-o
Democratic
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
race.
o-o
But in the general
o-o
election
o-o
they just embrace
o-o
their puppet
o-o
candidate?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Isn't it
o-o
brilliant?
o-o
Yet seductive.
o-o
Like the
o-o
gleeming smile
o-o
of a fetching lass
o-o
in an auto ad.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm
o-o
beginnin' to see
o-o
how come we,
o-o
er,
o-o
most voters,
o-o
dislike both
o-o
candidates,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
begin-italics and end-italics the Democrat.
o-o
I don't mean
o-o
any
o-o
disrespect.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
A lack of
o-o
respect
o-o
is what we
o-o
politicians
o-o
expect.
o-o
We know
o-o
we're stuck
o-o
in the middle,
o-o
between voters
o-o
and our biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
o-o
Now do you see
o-o
why voters
o-o
are distracted
o-o
by the
o-o
entertaining
o-o
conflict
o-o
between left
o-o
and right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Instead of words
o-o
I need a
o-o
picture.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
It's sort of like
o-o
when ancient
o-o
Roman rulers
o-o
distracted their
o-o
plebians
o-o
with dramatic
o-o
bloody fighting
o-o
in their colossal
o-o
Colosseum.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
your point
o-o
is beginning
o-o
to stick.
o-o
It's like the
o-o
insurection
o-o
on January sixth.
o-o
The fighters who
o-o
attacked Congress
o-o
believed they were
o-o
defending democracy.
o-o
Yet in reality
o-o
they were defending
o-o
the political down,
o-o
the biggest
o-o
campaign contributors.
o-o
They were duped
o-o
by the fake fight
o-o
between left
o-o
and right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's the picture.
o-o
Nowadays,
o-o
modern hyphen-here day
o-o
plebians
o-o
get to vote
o-o
which puppet
o-o
wins the fight
o-o
on the stage
o-o
we call
o-o
elections.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like
o-o
pickin'
o-o
pockets
o-o
while
o-o
celebrities
o-o
perform on stage?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's a bit rough.
o-o
But close enough.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
With their clout,
o-o
what's the
o-o
political down
o-o
really care
o-o
about?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Profits for the
o-o
businesses
o-o
they own.
o-o
What especially
o-o
delights them
o-o
are biz tax breaks.
o-o
And when they can
o-o
get a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
they grasp
o-o
onto that
o-o
like a
o-o
Titanic
o-o
passenger
o-o
would cling
o-o
to a spare
o-o
life vest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
o-o
Those business
o-o
owners pay
o-o
politicians
o-o
for lower taxes
o-o
'n no
o-o
competition.
o-o
That deal's sweet!
o-o
But that's
o-o
cheatin'.
o-o
It's corrupt.
o-o
Am I wrong?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You're right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm confused.
o-o
On the
o-o
political
o-o
right,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party seems to
o-o
care about some
o-o
non-business
o-o
issues like
o-o
abortions, and
o-o
gay marriage,
o-o
Christian values,
o-o
immigration,
o-o
'n such,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
They do glorify
o-o
those things on the
o-o
flag they fly.
o-o
But taxes, and
o-o
subsidies, and
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are their
o-o
real priorities.
o-o
That's because
o-o
party insiders,
o-o
in both parties,
o-o
get their
o-o
marching orders
o-o
from the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I think I'm
o-o
seein' how come
o-o
neither political
o-o
party really
o-o
gives a damn
o-o
'bout protectin'
o-o
coral reefs,
o-o
fixin' climate
o-o
change,
o-o
givin' homeless
o-o
folks an assist,
o-o
or listenin'
o-o
to what dolphins
o-o
have to say
o-o
about us
o-o
dumpin' trash
o-o
into their
o-o
swimmin' pool.
o-o
I see the
o-o
down folks
o-o
are usin'
o-o
religious
o-o
'n racial
o-o
issues
o-o
to divide 'n
o-o
distract.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Here's another
o-o
diversion tactic.
o-o
Money from the right
o-o
can fund
o-o
extreme agendas
o-o
on the left.
o-o
Like when the
o-o
LGB category
o-o
got extended
o-o
to include
o-o
queers and
o-o
transgenders.
o-o
That scares
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
to the right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
many voters
o-o
blindly
o-o
believe
o-o
the enemy
o-o
of their
o-o
enemy
o-o
is their
o-o
friend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's a powerful
o-o
political
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's foolish.
o-o
'Cause noone
o-o
can keep
o-o
begin-italics all end-italics their
o-o
enemies
o-o
in the opposite
o-o
team.
o-o
Not with just
o-o
two teams.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Here' something else
o-o
you should know.
o-o
It's easy
o-o
to hide the
o-o
giving of funds
o-o
to both sides,
o-o
left and right.
o-o
In fact there are
o-o
two brothers in
o-o
Florida in
o-o
the sugar biz.
o-o
One brother is
o-o
a Republican
o-o
who gives buckets
o-o
of money to
o-o
Republican
o-o
politicians.
o-o
The other brother
o-o
is a Democrat
o-o
who gives buckets
o-o
of money to
o-o
Democratic
o-o
politicians.
o-o
Ain't that sweet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N as hard to follow
o-o
as a rat
o-o
chased by
o-o
a cat.
o-o
So they don't
o-o
give a damn 'bout
o-o
left or right?
o-o
They just lobby
o-o
for sugar ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Subsidies.
o-o
Especially
o-o
tax money
o-o
that pays for
o-o
canals in Florida
o-o
so farmers
o-o
can grow
o-o
sugarcane.
o-o
They need that for
o-o
the bigger
o-o
financial gains
o-o
that come from
o-o
converting
o-o
sugarcane into
o-o
sugar.
o-o
That's what's done
o-o
by the businesses
o-o
those bros own.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a sour
o-o
deal for us.
o-o
How come this
o-o
isn't more
o-o
obvious?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
On commodity
o-o
price lists,
o-o
they used to list
o-o
sugar and
o-o
U.S. sugar
o-o
by those names.
o-o
But now
o-o
the names are
o-o
sugar number
o-o
eleven and
o-o
sugar number
o-o
sixteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a
o-o
slick trick.
o-o
Um,
o-o
there's somethin'
o-o
else that's a bit
o-o
fuzzy.
o-o
Don't some
o-o
rich folks
o-o
prefer the
o-o
Democratic
o-o
party?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Lots of lawyers
o-o
get lots of their
o-o
business from
o-o
Democratic voters,
o-o
so they like
o-o
Democratic
o-o
politicians.
o-o
And then there are
o-o
industries that
o-o
subdivide into
o-o
left and right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
o-o
I thought I was
o-o
followin' you
o-o
down main street,
o-o
but you just
o-o
ducked into a
o-o
dark alley.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Banks prefer the
o-o
Republican party.
o-o
'N credit unions
o-o
prefer the
o-o
Democratic party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
o-o
I think now I'm
o-o
seein' who's
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
down.
o-o
'N how come they
o-o
oppose us, the
o-o
voters,
o-o
their suckers,
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
o-o
But how do so
o-o
very few
o-o
rich folks
o-o
outvote us,
o-o
the non-rich, who
o-o
outnumber them?
o-o
Like hairs
o-o
outnumber whiskers
o-o
on a walrus.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
There are lots
o-o
of tricks
o-o
to control
o-o
politics.
o-o
For example,
o-o
do you know what
o-o
delegates are?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sure,
o-o
that's the
o-o
laundry cycle
o-o
women use to
o-o
wash their
o-o
underwear.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You're thinking
o-o
of delicates
o-o
with a begin-italics Cee end-italics no-space .
o-o
This is delegates
o-o
with a begin-italics Gee end-italics no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So I should
o-o
ask to try guts
o-o
the next time
o-o
I'm in a
o-o
delacatessen?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
A delegate
o-o
is someone
o-o
you vote for
o-o
and they vote for
o-o
the actual candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Like the
o-o
electoral college?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Sort of
o-o
like that.
o-o
But here
o-o
I'm talking
o-o
about a primary
o-o
election.
o-o
The one before
o-o
the nomination
o-o
convention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The conventions
o-o
I know about
o-o
sell
o-o
computer games,
o-o
comic books,
o-o
and whacky
o-o
kitchen gadgets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
A political
o-o
convention
o-o
doesn't sell
o-o
anything,
o-o
at least not
o-o
directly.
o-o
During a
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
election,
o-o
when you vote
o-o
for a governor,
o-o
secretary of state,
o-o
or president,
o-o
you're actually
o-o
voting for
o-o
someone who
o-o
has promised
o-o
to vote for
o-o
the candidate
o-o
whose name
o-o
you mark on
o-o
your ballot.
o-o
Those people,
o-o
the ones who
o-o
get enough votes,
o-o
are delegates.
o-o
They travel to
o-o
a convention
o-o
where they
o-o
vote on your
o-o
behalf.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why isn't my vote
o-o
counted directly?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Sometimes,
o-o
none of the
o-o
candidates
o-o
gets a majority
o-o
of votes.
o-o
There has to be
o-o
enough support
o-o
to justify
o-o
having just one
o-o
nominee
o-o
on the
o-o
general
o-o
election
o-o
ballot.
o-o
So at the
o-o
convention
o-o
the delegates
o-o
do rounds
o-o
of voting
o-o
until one
o-o
candidate
o-o
gets a majority,
o-o
that's half
o-o
the votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So we're at
o-o
a nomination
o-o
convention,
o-o
where one of the
o-o
delegates
o-o
is voting
o-o
on my behalf.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
After each round
o-o
of voting,
o-o
if there's no
o-o
majority,
o-o
the candidate
o-o
with the fewest
o-o
delegate votes
o-o
usually
o-o
drops out.
o-o
Traditionally
o-o
that candidate
o-o
tells their
o-o
delegates
o-o
who to vote for
o-o
in the next round.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm the one
o-o
spinning
o-o
round and round
o-o
in the
o-o
laundry
o-o
machine.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
It can get
o-o
very messy.
o-o
There used to be
o-o
lots of backroom
o-o
deals involved.
o-o
Like promises
o-o
of political
o-o
appointments
o-o
in return for
o-o
a candidate
o-o
telling
o-o
their delegates
o-o
to vote for
o-o
the more popular
o-o
candidate
o-o
who has made
o-o
that promise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
I see,
o-o
lots of tricks
o-o
go on
o-o
to influence
o-o
the delegates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Indeed.
o-o
And before women
o-o
got the right
o-o
to vote,
o-o
sexual bribery
o-o
was common.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoa!
o-o
Trading a vote
o-o
for sex?
o-o
That's a kind
o-o
of bribery
o-o
I didn't
o-o
know about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
People with
o-o
lots of money
o-o
can pay helpers
o-o
to pay for
o-o
whatever
o-o
helps the rich
o-o
to win.
o-o
And at the
o-o
Democratic
o-o
national
o-o
election,
o-o
where a
o-o
presidential
o-o
candidate
o-o
is chosen,
o-o
there are
o-o
superdelegates
o-o
who weren't
o-o
elected by
o-o
the voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow,
o-o
layers
o-o
and layers
o-o
of corrup...,
o-o
of extra
o-o
influence.
o-o
Just to get
o-o
this
o-o
majority
o-o
thingy.
o-o
Why is that
o-o
so damned
o-o
important?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
There's something
o-o
in politics
o-o
called
o-o
vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What do spittin'
o-o
goats have to do
o-o
with politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not goats.
o-o
Votes.
o-o
As in voting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Vote spittin'?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not spitting,
o-o
although long ago
o-o
there was lots
o-o
of spitting in
o-o
politics.
o-o
It's splitting,
o-o
vote splitting,
o-o
and it's the
o-o
election version
o-o
of divide and
o-o
conquer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's it!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N divide 'n
o-o
conquer.
o-o
Isn't that the
o-o
battle tactic
o-o
armies use when
o-o
they separate
o-o
enemy
o-o
soldiers from
o-o
one another?
o-o
'N then they can
o-o
attack the
o-o
smaller groups
o-o
when they're
o-o
aloner?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes, and in fact,
o-o
voting is
o-o
rooted in war
o-o
and fighting.
o-o
That's why women
o-o
didn't vote.
o-o
They weren't counted
o-o
because they
o-o
didn't fight.
o-o
Of course,
o-o
those rule makers
o-o
never met my
o-o
brother's
o-o
ex hyphen-here wife.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-explain Chuckles. end-explain
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
So voting
o-o
started out
o-o
as counting
o-o
to figure
o-o
out how many
o-o
men would be
o-o
in each army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And two small armies
o-o
would lose against
o-o
one bigger army.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yes,
o-o
if the big army
o-o
can fight just one
o-o
small army
o-o
at a time.
o-o
That's what dividing
o-o
the enemy enables.
o-o
That's why Lincoln
o-o
said a house divided
o-o
cannot stand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah, so long ago
o-o
votin' began
o-o
as a way to
o-o
count potential
o-o
army sizes.
o-o
'N the smaller
o-o
army surrenders?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Saves a lot of dying,
o-o
no?
o-o
And when splitting
o-o
can't be done
o-o
physically,
o-o
then splitting
o-o
psychologically
o-o
works too.
o-o
In politics,
o-o
that's what
o-o
religious
o-o
differences
o-o
do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how does this
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
work?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Well, it involves
o-o
math.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o
ya mean,
o-o
mathematics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Certainly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In my opinion
o-o
math's the devil's
o-o
favorite
o-o
form of torture.
o-o
If I had to
o-o
choose between
o-o
doin' just one page
o-o
of math homework,
o-o
or standin' under
o-o
a tall fir tree
o-o
gettin' cut down,
o-o
I'd be there
o-o
yellin' begin-italics timber! end-italics
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
I don't like it
o-o
either.
o-o
And I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
well enough to
o-o
clearly
o-o
explain how it
o-o
all works.
o-o
I just know that
o-o
it works.
o-o
So we, the
o-o
politicians,
o-o
are effectively
o-o
hobbled and
o-o
handcuffed
o-o
and gagged
o-o
when we cast
o-o
our votes in
o-o
Congress.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ya said there's
o-o
distractions.
o-o
How can just
o-o
distractions
o-o
hide this vote
o-o
splittin'
o-o
so effectively?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You've heard of
o-o
the electoral college?
o-o
And gerrymandering?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I admit long ago
o-o
I wondered if
o-o
Jerry Mander
o-o
was someone
o-o
important.
o-o
Now I realize
o-o
those're 'bout the
o-o
attention hyphen-here grabbin'
o-o
fight between
o-o
Republicans
o-o
and
o-o
Democrats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's why news
o-o
reporters
o-o
are not blocked
o-o
from writing and
o-o
speaking about those
o-o
unfairness
o-o
topics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Which now I know
o-o
helps distract from,
o-o
'n hide,
o-o
the bigger fight
o-o
between
o-o
political up
o-o
'n
o-o
political down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
And you've heard of
o-o
the money bonus
o-o
that a third-party
o-o
presidential
o-o
candidate can
o-o
get if they get
o-o
more than a
o-o
certain percent
o-o
of the vote?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aha!
o-o
That's a tactic
o-o
to split votes
o-o
away from ...
o-o
well who?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
In the U.S.,
o-o
third parties
o-o
that get much funding
o-o
are almost always
o-o
on the left.
o-o
Whenever needed
o-o
they're quietly
o-o
seeded with funds
o-o
from conservatives.
o-o
That splits votes
o-o
away from the
o-o
Democratic
o-o
nominee.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I see.
o-o
It just affects the
o-o
distractin' balance
o-o
between left
o-o
'n right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
And if a
o-o
begin-italics conservative end-italics
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
candidate
o-o
begins to do well
o-o
in the polls,
o-o
they get a bribe
o-o
to drop out.
o-o
That concentrates
o-o
conservative
o-o
voters' ballots
o-o
on the single
o-o
Republican
o-o
nominee.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N now I see
o-o
how come news media

'n those slippery
o-o

o-o

This is simple.
o-o
Back when

There was just

ambee sings-politician amenn
The winning
o-o
strategy
o-o
came to be
o-o
for each party

to discover

an example

of a blocking

tactic that

kind of tactic
o-o
wouldn't

o-o
That's because
o-o
in the general

o-o
each party

Now I'm confused again.
o-o
How can there be
o-o
two Republicans
o-o

o-o
That would cause
o-o
vote splitting.
o-o

He asked me to
o-o
help you on your
o-o
mission to earn
o-o
money using
o-o
his tricks.

I won't be a
o-o
snitch or fink.
o-o
'N anyways I
o-o
can't yet link
o-o
the problem of
o-o
vote splittin'
o-o
to a solution.
o-o
One that can
o-o
defeat this
o-o
unfairness.
o-o
So I need to
o-o
learn more.
o-o
Do you know who
o-o
would know how
o-o
to fix this
o-o
mess?
o-o
The unfair
o-o
politics?

Probably
o-o
that would be
o-o
a professor
o-o
of mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Aiee!
o-o
Scholastic
o-o
gymnastics!
o-o
In math no less.
o-o
That's too
o-o
advanced.
o-o
I'm almost
o-o
peeing
o-o
in my pants,
o-o
it scares me so!
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Well I've got to go.
o-o
I wish you luck
o-o
in understanding
o-o
yet more
o-o
so maybe someday
o-o
you can help clean up
o-o
the muck
o-o
on the
o-o
political
o-o
stage.
o-o
In the meantime,
o-o
the political
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
o-o
Voters
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
assume the rich
o-o
are at
o-o
the top.
o-o
Yes, politicians
o-o
have all been bought.
o-o
But as voters
o-o
you've got
o-o
more power than
o-o
the SpaceX
o-o
rockets,
o-o
a swarm of
o-o
locusts,
o-o
and a flu
o-o
virus,
o-o
all working
o-o
together on
o-o
the same team.

So you think
o-o
maybe someday
o-o
the voters
o-o
will,
o-o
uh,
o-o
...
end-lyric

o-o
ambee sings-politician amenn
...
o-o
reign
o-o
supreme?
o-o
Eventually.
o-o
Hopefully.
o-o
Then us
o-o
politicians
o-o
will become begin-italics your end-italics
o-o
puppets.
o-o
But currently
o-o
we're the puppets
o-o
of wealthy
o-o
business
o-o
owners.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I admit
o-o
I'm seein' a
o-o
bit of hope 
o-o
for a fix.
o-o
To get less
o-o
dysfunctional
o-o
politics.
o-o
Now I know the
o-o
greedy rich
o-o
distract us with
o-o
left versus right.
o-o
Yet up versus down,
o-o
that's the real fight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You're bright.
o-o
Good luck!
o-o
But don't forget,
o-o
it was some
o-o
other schmuck
o-o
who gave you
o-o
the tour of the
o-o
elephant and
o-o
donkey muck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thank you
o-o
for tiltin'
o-o
my brain
o-o
to better see
o-o
the political
o-o
terrain.
o-o
You've saved me
o-o
from going
o-o
insane.
