Think about this.

The love

Yeah,

important.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Did you know
o-o
that long ago,
o-o
when writing
o-o
was new,
o-o
writing was used
o-o
for banking
o-o
and accounting?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That was before
o-o
my time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That way money
o-o
was stored in banks,
o-o
not in pockets
o-o
nor in bags

anymore.
sentence-next
o-o
That protected
o-o
traders from

pirates,

marauding

desperadoes.

Ah, pirates.

o-o
That was a

profession

back when

swashbuckling exams

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Pickpockets,

Now that money

'N the modern
o-o
version of pirates
o-o
is lawyers?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Oh no,
o-o
today's lawyers
o-o
are like
o-o
ancient scribes.
sentence-next
o-o
They write

documents,
o-o
but on paper
o-o
instead of on
o-o
parchment,
o-o

o-o
or pyramid

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So how do you
o-o
choose where to
o-o
put the money
o-o
you've got,
o-o
to get more?
sentence-next
o-o
So you don't

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Besides side hyphen-here stepping

traps set by

The ones where I

become an

even bigger

ambee sings-damien amenn
How come you
o-o
don't invest in

businesses
o-o
that sell products
o-o
and services
o-o
that are the best?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
The high-profit one
o-o
has to compensate

for the other eight,

the ones that flop.

Ah, yes,

the unicorn.

o-o
The one that

sentence-next
o-o
Missing out on

one of those

would be the worst.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes, one unicorn

is worth more than
o-o
five zebras
o-o
in the brush.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Zebras?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Those are the
o-o
small businesses
o-o
that march to
o-o
riches slowly,
o-o
by making
o-o
something that
o-o
consumers
o-o
readily want,
o-o
and selling
o-o
a quality
o-o
version at an
o-o
affordable
o-o
price.
sentence-next
o-o
They don't need our
o-o
venture capital
o-o
for big
o-o
marketing
o-o
blitzes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Isn't the whole
o-o
business scene
o-o
about selling what
o-o
customers want?
sentence-next
o-o
Or crave,
o-o
like nicotine,
o-o
...
o-o
'n chocolate

milk
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Sure money
o-o
can be used
o-o
to oppose
o-o
customer
o-o
dissatisfaction.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What I mean is,
o-o
well,
o-o
I'd like to
o-o
find fundin'
o-o
for a business
o-o
venture.
sentence-next
o-o
I've invented a
o-o
tool for cleanin'
o-o
leaf gutters,
o-o
without gettin'
o-o
on a ladder.
sentence-next
o-o
So I'll ask,
o-o
would ya invest
o-o
in a business
o-o
that sells the best
o-o
kind of tool
o-o
for that task?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Nah, that would
o-o
be harder
o-o
to advertise
o-o
than a cordless
o-o
bungee hyphen-here jumping
o-o
franchise.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lots of people
o-o
get hurt
o-o
when they hit
o-o
the dirt
o-o
from fallin' off
o-o
a ladder while
o-o
cleanin'
o-o
a gutter.
sentence-next
o-o
Some land on
o-o
their head,
o-o
and end up dead.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That's a great spin!
sentence-next
o-o
Fear of fallin'.
sentence-next
o-o
That's a fear that
o-o
would sell lots of
o-o
product.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you have
o-o
a patent?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I can't afford
o-o
that expense.
sentence-next
o-o
At thousands
o-o
of dollars,
o-o
that cost
o-o
is way too
o-o
immense.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Many tens of
o-o
thousands of
o-o
bucks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sucks.
sentence-next
o-o
I couldn't afford
o-o
even a few hundred
o-o
dollars to ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Why would I
o-o
invest?
sentence-next
o-o
Not unless
o-o
there's a
o-o
barrier
o-o
against
o-o
competitors.
sentence-next
o-o
There's gotta
o-o
be a
o-o
monopoly.
sentence-next
o-o
Either
o-o
a legal
o-o
monopoly,
o-o
or some kind of
o-o
virtual
o-o
monopoly.
sentence-next
o-o
That way my
o-o
investment
o-o
doesn't
o-o
evaporate
o-o
like a raindrop
o-o
falling into
o-o
Death Valley.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So a workin'
o-o
prototype's
o-o
not enough?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Sorry to sound
o-o
tough,
o-o
but that's too
o-o
rough.
sentence-next
o-o
That's as useless
o-o
as a machine hyphen-here gun mount
o-o
on the back of
o-o
a golf cart.
sentence-next
o-o
What the biz needs
o-o
to succeed
o-o
is a big amount
o-o
of income,
o-o
plus customers and
o-o
testimonials.
sentence-next
o-o
Then we might
o-o
lay out some
o-o
funds.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If income I
o-o
already had,
o-o
I could self hyphen-here fund it.
sentence-next
o-o
'N with that
o-o
I could go to
o-o
a bank 'n ask
o-o
for a loan.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Ha,
o-o
the bank
o-o
officials
o-o
might nod
o-o
earnestly
o-o
instead of
o-o
groan
o-o
...
o-o
out loud.
sentence-next
o-o
They might even
o-o
encourage
o-o
you to open
o-o
an account,
o-o
and get you to
o-o
fill out a
o-o
few forms.
sentence-next
o-o
But when you've
o-o
stepped out
o-o
the door,
o-o
they'll wet
o-o
themselves with
o-o
laughter.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If I were to
o-o
buy a house
o-o
they'd loan for that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
A mortgage,
o-o
hah.
sentence-next
o-o
It doesn't work
o-o
like that.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead
o-o
the bank
o-o
buys the
o-o
house.
sentence-next
o-o
Your down payment's
o-o
big enough
o-o
to pay for
o-o
a year of
o-o
law school.
sentence-next
o-o
So if soon
o-o
you lose your job
o-o
and miss a
o-o
payment,
o-o
a remittance,
o-o
or two,
o-o
they sell the house.
sentence-next
o-o
Then you and a
o-o
couple of
o-o
other
o-o
homeowners
o-o
have paid for a
o-o
banker's kid
o-o
to become
o-o
a lawyer.
sentence-next
o-o
That path leads to
o-o
homelessness,
o-o
unless you have
o-o
trustworthy
o-o
income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So banks
o-o
don't loan
o-o
money?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They still do
o-o
a bit,
o-o
occasionally.
sentence-next
o-o
Mostly now they're
o-o
high hyphen-here rolling gamblers
o-o
that make casinos
o-o
look like kids
o-o
playing a game
o-o
of Monopoly.
sentence-next
o-o
They make
o-o
big money
o-o
by buying and
o-o
selling, ah,
o-o
another word
o-o
for money,
o-o
derivatives.
sentence-next
o-o
Big things,
o-o
not small things.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What're
o-o
derivatives?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Those are contracts
o-o
on paper, or the
o-o
cyberspace
o-o
equivalent,
o-o
written by lawyers.
sentence-next
o-o
Lots of times
o-o
they're promises
o-o
to pay money if
o-o
something happens,
o-o
like if interest
o-o
rates rise or fall.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That sounds
o-o
a lot like
o-o
gamblin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It is.
sentence-next
o-o
And gambling,
o-o
that's what we
o-o
venture
o-o
capitalists
o-o
do too.
sentence-next
o-o
We supply
o-o
capital.
sentence-next
o-o
It's like those
o-o
ancient sea
o-o
voyages.
sentence-next
o-o
Someone had to
o-o
buy the ship,
o-o
pay sailors,
o-o
and stock up
o-o
on gruel
o-o
and limes,
o-o
before they could
o-o
sail from the dock.
sentence-next
o-o
Then, on return,
o-o
if they returned,
o-o
the cargo was
o-o
sold, and the
o-o
backer got his
o-o
share of the
o-o
gold.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N the captain
o-o
'n crew got what?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What they got was
o-o
a temporary pass
o-o
to the middle class.
sentence-next
o-o
Until they got
o-o
swindled,
o-o
badly beaten
o-o
in a
o-o
casino,
o-o
or stuck with
o-o
alimony
o-o
payments
o-o
that would fund
o-o
a small bank.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But the backer
o-o
got more?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Of course, 'cause
o-o
he took the
o-o
biggest risk.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember there
o-o
were pirates.
sentence-next
o-o
And sometimes
o-o
the winds
o-o
were not brisk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Those times
o-o
were cruel,
o-o
barbaric,
o-o
and excitin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They were.
sentence-next
o-o
In those
o-o
ancient times
o-o
fighting was done
o-o
by soldiers.
sentence-next
o-o
Now fighting
o-o
is so much
o-o
safer.
sentence-next
o-o
It's done by
o-o
lawyers
o-o
fighting with
o-o
legal
o-o
documents
o-o
instead of
o-o
swords.
sentence-next
o-o
And instead of
o-o
wearing armor,
o-o
or bullet hyphen-here proof
o-o
vests,
o-o
they wear
o-o
colorful
o-o
neckties,
o-o
or Victoria's
o-o
Secret
o-o
lingerie.
sentence-next
o-o
Quite civilized
o-o
nowadays.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I see
o-o
how money works.
sentence-next
o-o
So how can I
o-o
switch from bein'
o-o
an employee
o-o
to become
o-o
an employer?
sentence-next
o-o
Ownin' a small
o-o
business,
o-o
that's my dream.
sentence-next
o-o
Some success,
o-o
financially,
o-o
so I can buy
o-o
a fixer hyphen-here upper house,
o-o
pay for ultra hyphen-here fast
o-o
access to,
o-o
er, ...,
o-o
kitten videos,
o-o
'n drive a car
o-o
that didn't come off
o-o
Henry Ford's
o-o
production line.
sentence-next
o-o
Not a
o-o
private jet.
sentence-next
o-o
Not even just
o-o
a log cabin
o-o
in the woods.
sentence-next
o-o
Not yet.
sentence-next
o-o
I just want
o-o
fair rewards
o-o
for my hard work.
sentence-next
o-o
How do I
o-o
make that leap?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You need to
o-o
dig deep,
o-o
to develop
o-o
a compelling
o-o
vision.
sentence-next
o-o
A lofty one
o-o
that will
o-o
inspire.
sentence-next
o-o
Then you hire
o-o
workers who
o-o
follow your
o-o
vision like
o-o
ducklings behind
o-o
their mom.
sentence-next
o-o
You work them hard.
sentence-next
o-o
You hire lawyers
o-o
to sue
o-o
competitors.
sentence-next
o-o
And of course you
o-o
hire marketing
o-o
folks who
o-o
super hyphen-here size
o-o
your PR
o-o
blitzes.
sentence-next
o-o
They'll make
o-o
ads that are
o-o
so grand
o-o
that consumers
o-o
will trust
o-o
your brand.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So I should
o-o
start a cult?
sentence-next
o-o
'N of course
o-o
there'd be
o-o
an app
o-o
with that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
A cult
o-o
would put you
o-o
on the wealthy
o-o
map
o-o
if you shift
o-o
the idolatry
o-o
to money,
o-o
instead of
o-o
focusing
o-o
on death.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact,
o-o
that's not a bad way
o-o
to say
o-o
what business
o-o
leaders
o-o
really do.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It sounds like
o-o
makin' money
o-o
is about lyin'
o-o
'n cheatin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's not lying.
sentence-next
o-o
That's not cheating.
sentence-next
o-o
It's marketing
o-o
and stepping on
o-o
toes.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact
o-o
anything goes.
sentence-next
o-o
But not lying
o-o
and cheating.
sentence-next
o-o
'Cause
o-o
that lands you in
o-o
the slammer.
sentence-next
o-o
That'd be a
o-o
bummer
o-o
'cause
o-o
your bank accounts
o-o
in prison
o-o
are as useless
o-o
as a light saber
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How about

that embarrassing

stories about

grocery stores

o-o
That's because

grocery stores

pay for lots

of those

colorful

ads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

keeps a corporation

sentence-next
o-o
Another trick is
o-o
big corporations

hire the big four

by those big four

a sweet deal.

to be?

o-o
I wanna

sentence-next
o-o
What's the best

strategy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
To become

put the squeeze

o-o
Become the

bottleneck

between supply

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you mean
o-o
extortion's
o-o
the best kind of
o-o
plan?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
To see what
o-o
I mean,
o-o
consider the

music industry.
sentence-next
o-o
The way it was
o-o
years ago,
o-o
before a
o-o
recording
o-o
studio
o-o
got squeezed
o-o
into a
o-o
laptop
o-o
computer.
sentence-next
o-o
Back then,
o-o
cutting
o-o
a record,
o-o
literally,
o-o
meant cutting grooves
o-o
on a master
o-o
disk.
sentence-next
o-o
That process
o-o
used very
o-o
expensive
o-o
equipment
o-o
to transform
o-o
sound waves
o-o
into vibrations
o-o
of the cutting
o-o
needle.
sentence-next
o-o
That equipment
o-o
was so rare
o-o
that musicians
o-o
would work for cheap.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Or trade sex
o-o
for a record deal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Sometimes
o-o
that was a perk.
sentence-next
o-o
But times have changed.
sentence-next
o-o
Now a
o-o
microphone
o-o
and an iPad
o-o
plus some apps
o-o
can do it all.
sentence-next
o-o
From making
o-o
an album to
o-o
selling it
o-o
online.
sentence-next
o-o
So that pinch point,
o-o
that bottleneck,
o-o
is gone.
sentence-next
o-o
And with it went
o-o
lots of profit.
sentence-next
o-o
Now,
o-o
music hyphen-here industry
o-o
lawyers
o-o
hold their grip
o-o
by threatening
o-o

o-o
tavern, bar, or

restaurant
o-o
that doesn't buy
o-o
a license
o-o
to play the

copyrighted

music those
o-o
lawyers control.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

o-o

sentence-next
o-o
Now I see.
sentence-next
o-o
Record labels
o-o
lost their

bottleneck
o-o
because they
o-o
used to
o-o
monopolize
o-o
the
o-o
technology
o-o
that now fits
o-o
inside
o-o
a tablet
o-o
app.
sentence-next
o-o
Aren't newspapers
o-o
losing their
o-o
grip too?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
And movie
o-o
producers.
sentence-next
o-o
And book
o-o
publishers.
sentence-next
o-o
And radio
o-o
and TV
o-o
stations.
sentence-next
o-o
They lost their
o-o
monopolies.
sentence-next
o-o
Now those
o-o
industries
o-o
are like airplanes
o-o
dropping from
o-o
the sky in a
o-o
tailspin.
sentence-next
o-o
So the trick
o-o
is to find
o-o
a new
o-o
bottleneck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Doesn't a patent
o-o
provide a
o-o
bottleneck?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
In theory,
o-o
yeah.
sentence-next
o-o
But really,
o-o
a patent
o-o
bottleneck
o-o
only works for
o-o
a big big
o-o
invention.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So inventing's
o-o
a dead end?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
If you could find

o-o
that'd be sweet.
sentence-next
o-o
Very profitable.
sentence-next
o-o
But a
o-o
creative
o-o
genius is
o-o
rare and
o-o
doesn't work
o-o
for cheap.
sentence-next
o-o
And when you post
o-o
a job opening
o-o
like that,
o-o
the job
o-o
applicants are
o-o
pompous artists,
o-o
unemployed

o-o
people like
o-o
ditsy
o-o
Dixie
o-o
Dinah from

North Carolina.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the idea

behind a

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That's the key.
sentence-next
o-o
A technology
o-o
monopoly
o-o

are two of the
o-o
best.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
From what you said,
o-o
a business
o-o

o-o
must be legal.
sentence-next
o-o
So why have you
o-o
been sayin'
o-o
legal
o-o
monopoly?
sentence-next
o-o
Instead of just
o-o
monopoly?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Legal monopoly

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's better

sentence-next
o-o
But yeah,
o-o
sugar and
o-o
artificial
o-o
sweeteners
o-o
have less

because of
o-o
that law.

o-o
Congress passed

a law against

to that partial

o-o
pharmaceutical

certain kinds

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
By oil I mean
o-o
barrels of

crude oil.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's for
o-o

people

Commodities

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What do jewelry

things are
o-o
bought and sold
o-o
as raw materials.
sentence-next
o-o
In huge amounts,
o-o
like cargo

Heating oil,

a nice

profit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Could you teach me

that trick?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
The price

go up or down
o-o
by thousands
o-o

o-o
within

an hour.
sentence-next
o-o
It's only for

those of us

it went the

wrong way
o-o
by tens

of thousands
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

owning a

business.
sentence-next
o-o
For that
o-o
are there
o-o
other tricks?
sentence-next
o-o
For getting
o-o
big profits?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As many as an
o-o
eagle has feathers.
sentence-next
o-o
Another is
o-o
slowing down
o-o
product
o-o
innovations.
sentence-next
o-o
If a product

takes too big
o-o
of a leap,
o-o
we miss out on
o-o
consumers
o-o
paying for each
o-o
slight
o-o
improvement.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the
o-o
most important
o-o
trick?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That has to be
o-o
giving
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributions
o-o
to political
o-o
candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
After they
o-o
get re hyphen-here elected
o-o
they protect
o-o
the laws that give
o-o
our business
o-o
tax break after
o-o
tax break.
sentence-next
o-o
And they
o-o
protect our
o-o
legal
o-o
monopolies,
o-o
and
o-o
taxpayer hyphen-here funded
o-o
subsidies.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why big

businesses pay
o-o
six hyphen-here figure
o-o
salaries
o-o
so freely.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah yes, money
o-o
in politics.
sentence-next
o-o
I know 'bout that.
sentence-next
o-o
But I don't yet
o-o
understand
o-o
why us voters,
o-o
er,
o-o
...
o-o
how it works.
sentence-next
o-o
Non hyphen-here rich voters
o-o
greatly outnumber
o-o
the wealthy,
o-o
so how can
o-o
money
o-o
outweigh those votes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
We've
o-o
infiltrated
o-o
both parties.
sentence-next
o-o
This is how we
o-o
control who wins
o-o
the primary
o-o
elections of
o-o
both parties.
sentence-next
o-o
So general
o-o
elections are
o-o
between a
o-o
puppet Republican
o-o
and a puppet
o-o
Democrat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah, puppets win.
sentence-next
o-o
I knew that part.
sentence-next
o-o
But I hadn't
o-o
noticed the
o-o
infiltration
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
In the primary,
o-o
the winner's always
o-o
from the correct party,
o-o
so the money
o-o
bias goes
o-o
unchallenged.
sentence-next
o-o
In the
o-o
general
o-o
election
o-o
Republican
o-o
voters
o-o
assume
o-o
Democrats
o-o
are dimwits,
o-o
and Democratic
o-o
voters
o-o
assume
o-o
Republicans
o-o
are dimwits.
sentence-next
o-o
But then
o-o
it's too late.
sentence-next
o-o
For added
o-o
insurance
o-o
in a tight race
o-o
we might give a
o-o
bit of money
o-o
to an unpopular
o-o
candidate
o-o
we hate.
sentence-next
o-o
But we give
o-o
far more to
o-o
the one we
o-o
choose.
sentence-next
o-o
That way we
o-o
can't lose.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How come news
o-o
reporters
o-o
don't expose
o-o
what's behind
o-o
those magic
o-o
tricks?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That flow of money
o-o
is harder to follow
o-o
than a mouse
o-o
running through
o-o
a cornfield.
sentence-next
o-o
Such as when
o-o
rich wives register
o-o
as Democrats
o-o
and give family money
o-o
to conservative
o-o
Democratic politicians
o-o
during primary elections.
end-lyric

isn't there?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You are bright!
sentence-next
o-o
Yes, we pay news sources
o-o
to entertain and

distractions are

issues of

religion.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Religion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Abortion is the

really useful one.
sentence-next
o-o
With that the

Republican
o-o
party has lots

of fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the Republican
o-o
party doesn't
o-o
really care 'bout
o-o
abortion?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
We sorta care,
o-o
but not as much
o-o
as tax breaks
o-o
and subsidies
o-o
and our legal
o-o
monopolies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I have to admit
o-o
voters don't see
o-o
through that.
sentence-next

They're so distracted

by the fight between

So,

which candidates

how much?
end-lyric

The consultants

where the money

should go.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N how do those
o-o
consultants know
o-o
which puppets, er,
o-o
politicians to
o-o
bribe, er, fund?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They monopolize
o-o
their secrets,

their strategies.
sentence-next
o-o
They're like
o-o
astrologers
o-o
and alchemists
o-o
from long ago.
sentence-next
o-o
Back before
o-o
science tanked
o-o
the profits
