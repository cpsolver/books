ambee sings-desha amenn

ambee sings-damien amenn
Nice to meet ya.
o-o
I'm name-damien no-space .

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thanks for meetin'
o-o
with me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
For nothing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the meaning
o-o
of begin-italics de nada end-italics
o-o
in Spanish.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah I know.
o-o
My mom's

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Then why did you
o-o
ask?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is there cannibis
o-o
in that cookie?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
No you can't
o-o
have one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I just wondered
o-o
what's in it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Dried cherries,
o-o
chocolate chips,
o-o
rolled oats,
o-o
sugar and stevia,
o-o
and ghee,
o-o
but nothing
o-o
funny.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ya said you
o-o
wanted to meet
o-o
with me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Congressman
o-o
name-politician-last
o-o
said I should meet
o-o
with you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
To talk about
o-o
how come
o-o
politics is so
o-o
dysfunctional,
o-o
you said
o-o
in your text.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Damn right!
o-o
It's so so so
o-o
dysfunctional.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So,
o-o
do you know
o-o
about vote
o-o
splittin'?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What do goats
o-o
have to do with
o-o
politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Not goats.
o-o
Not spitting.
o-o
Vote splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Splitting votes
o-o
in half?
o-o
That's a half hyphen-here wit
o-o
idea.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Not splitting
o-o
ballots.
o-o
Splitting voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's murder.
o-o
Yes politicians
o-o
do murder
o-o
innocent people.
o-o
They write laws
o-o
that come from
o-o
Thomas Crapper's
o-o
brainchild.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's not what
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
is.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Then it sounds quite
o-o
esoteric.
o-o
What's important
o-o
is that the world
o-o
is suffering
o-o
under an
o-o
epidemic
o-o
of toxic
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
corruption's
o-o
so selfish
o-o
and unfair.
o-o
It's like leavin'
o-o
just four squares
o-o
of toilet
o-o
paper onna
o-o
toilet paper
o-o
roll.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's zillions
o-o
of times worse
o-o
than that.
o-o
Corruption
o-o
kills through
o-o
economic suffering
o-o
that leads to
o-o
suicide,
o-o
homicide,
o-o
and slow death
o-o
by fast food.
o-o
Corruption
o-o
kills by letting
o-o
gun makers push
o-o
assault rifles
o-o
into the hands of
o-o
clueless kids
o-o
who use them
o-o
to take the lives
o-o
of schoolkids,
o-o
minorities,
o-o
and even
o-o
the police
o-o
officers
o-o
who protect
o-o
us.
o-o
And corruption
o-o
gives the green light
o-o
to cars killing
o-o
pedestrians.
o-o
And the companion
o-o
of corruption
o-o
is despair.
o-o
Life is so unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
begin-italics The companion
o-o
of corruption
o-o
is despair. end-italics
o-o
If that's from
o-o
the Bible
o-o
I've never
o-o
heard it,
o-o
but I agree.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Skip the sermons.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Vote splittin's
o-o
at the root of
o-o
unfair elections,
o-o
so do ya wanna
o-o
hear about it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Tell me how you
o-o
think it makes
o-o
a difference.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
For instance,
o-o
suppose there's
o-o
four politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What are their names?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I dunno.
o-o
This is just a
o-o
generic
o-o
for instance.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Generic is dead,
o-o
like the people here.
o-o
Let's bring them
o-o
to life.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ya can raise
o-o
the dead?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not those thems.
o-o
You describe
o-o
your begin-italics for
o-o
instance end-italics
o-o
politicians,
o-o
I'll give them
o-o
names.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Two of them are
o-o
puppets of
o-o
wealthy
o-o
business
o-o
owners.
o-o
The other two
o-o
promise to
o-o
reduce
o-o
corruption,
o-o
so they're more
o-o
well hyphen-here liked.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The names of the
o-o
first two are
o-o
Pinoke and
o-o
Oscar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Could you explain
o-o
what's in your brain?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Pinoke is a
o-o
nickname for
o-o
Pinnochio,
o-o
the puppet
o-o
whose nose grows
o-o
when he lies.
o-o
And Oscar's last
o-o
name is the Grouch.
o-o
He lives in trash
o-o
just like corrupt
o-o
politicians.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'Kay.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The other two are
o-o
named Barack,
o-o
'cause we can hope
o-o
for change,
o-o
and Hypatia
o-o
'cause women
o-o
should rule.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
With these live
o-o
candidates,
o-o
two cruel,
o-o
'n two cool,
o-o
who'd win?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Either Barack
o-o
or Hypatia,
o-o
the cool ones,
o-o
obviously.
o-o
'Cause voters want
o-o
less corruption.
o-o
Voters don't want
o-o
Pinoke,
o-o
don't want Oscar.
o-o
Don't want the
o-o
cruel ones.
o-o
They're the puppets
o-o
of money hyphen-here obsessed,
o-o
short hyphen-here sighted,
o-o
large hyphen-here mouthed
o-o
bass.
o-o
The turds.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Right.
o-o
The voters
o-o
get who they
o-o
favored.
o-o
But then
o-o
big hyphen-here money
o-o
donors
o-o
arrive.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now you'll say
o-o
their money
o-o
buys ads.
o-o
Filled with lies.
o-o
Ones that
o-o
hypnotize.
o-o
The way a car's
o-o
headlights
o-o
freeze
o-o
a bumpkin
o-o
rabbit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Only the
o-o
terminally
o-o
stupid'd
o-o
fall for those.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So tell me
o-o
how you think
o-o
it goes.
o-o
Why money
o-o
alters the
o-o
winners.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wealthy business
o-o
owners,
o-o
who're the biggest
o-o
campaign donors,
o-o
in private they choose
o-o
which puppet gets
o-o
their dollars.
o-o
If they like
o-o
the look of
o-o
Pinoke's nose,
o-o
then they propose
o-o
to Oscar
o-o
that he take
o-o
a hike
o-o
on the
o-o
Appalachian
o-o
trail.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That wouldn't fail
o-o
to make Oscar
o-o
a grouch.
o-o
What if he
o-o
should refuse?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They point out
o-o
he'll lose.
o-o
Without their
o-o
funds.
o-o
Or they bribe him
o-o
with favors,
o-o
if that's what
o-o
it takes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A dumpster full
o-o
of cookies
o-o
and cakes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Or a lifetime
o-o
subscription
o-o
to Grouch Magazine.
o-o
That'd leave
o-o
Pinoke and
o-o
Hypatia
o-o
and Barack.
o-o
Who'd win that
o-o
three hyphen-here way race?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah,
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
would split their votes
o-o
between Barack
o-o
and Hypatia.
o-o
That would make
o-o
it easier for
o-o
Pinoke to reach
o-o
victory.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Plus Koch begin-explain mistakenly pronounced as begin-italics cock end-italics end-explain Brothers
o-o
'n Forbes
o-o
levels of
o-o
dollars,
o-o
those'd
o-o
pay for ads
o-o
that attack
o-o
Hypatia
o-o
and Barack.
o-o
Plus photos
o-o
of Pinoke
o-o
would be
o-o
photoshopped
o-o
to make his nose
o-o
look normal size
o-o
to hide his lies.
o-o
That'd tip the
o-o
three hyphen-here way balance
o-o
enough
o-o
to rig the race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A puppet wins.
o-o
That's unfair!
o-o
The winner's
o-o
chosen by
o-o
millionaires.
o-o
Yet,
o-o
more voters prefer
o-o
either Hypatia
o-o
or Barack.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's what I've
o-o
figured out.
o-o
But now I'm stuck.
o-o
I dunno how
o-o
to change elections
o-o
so they don't suck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We can call attention
o-o
to this deception.
o-o
We'll get voters
o-o
to concentrate
o-o
their votes on
o-o
either Barack
o-o
or Hypatia.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Who'd decide
o-o
which candidate
o-o
to boycott?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We the voters
o-o
could get one to
o-o
vacate their spot,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That'd coax
o-o
the wealthiest
o-o
campaign donors
o-o
to quietly fund
o-o
yet another
o-o
candidate.
o-o
One who also
o-o
promises to
o-o
reduce corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Let's name this one
o-o
Gandhi.
o-o
Yes this
o-o
whack hyphen-here a hyphen-here mole
o-o
tactic's
o-o
difficult to beat.
o-o
It splits the voters
o-o
even more,
o-o
making it
o-o
even harder
o-o
to defeat
o-o
their single puppet.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
All that happens
o-o
in each
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
election.
o-o
Then in the
o-o
begin-italics general end-italics
o-o
election
o-o
we have to choose
o-o
between the two
o-o
puppets,
o-o
one from each
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now it makes
o-o
yet more sense
o-o
why we have
o-o
just two main
o-o
political
o-o
parties.
o-o
This is quite
o-o
unlike
o-o
what I read in
o-o
poly sci begin-explain pronounced SIGH end-explain
o-o
textbooks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N years ago
o-o
puppet
o-o
politicians
o-o
passed a law
o-o
that gives
o-o
taxpayer funds
o-o
to a
o-o
third hyphen-here party
o-o
presidential
o-o
candidate
o-o
who gets more than
o-o
five percent of
o-o
the vote.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I thought that
o-o
was a good thing.
o-o
But so far
o-o
it's been a bribe
o-o
to parties on the
o-o
liberal side.
o-o
While conservative
o-o
parties
o-o
don't take that bait.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The conservative
o-o
candidates
o-o
get their bribes
o-o
earlier,
o-o
before
o-o
election
o-o
season starts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So liberals
o-o
get seduced
o-o
into splitting
o-o
their votes.
o-o
While conservatives
o-o
quietly concentrate
o-o
their votes on just
o-o
one candidate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You learn fast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I have a degree
o-o
in political
o-o
science.
o-o
But they never
o-o
taught us the
o-o
hidden money
o-o
part of this
o-o
tactical
o-o
unfairness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The unfairness
o-o
is well hyphen-here hidden
o-o
behind
o-o
numbers.
o-o
'N math to me
o-o
is scary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What scares me is
o-o
that our planet
o-o
is losing
o-o
snow leopards and
o-o
elephants, and
o-o
rhinoceros ...
o-o
es, and
o-o
dolphins, and
o-o
coral reefs, and
o-o
plant species
o-o
that could cure
o-o
and feed.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that what
o-o
pushed you into
o-o
politics?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
At the age of
o-o
fourteen, ...
o-o
my mother died.
o-o
And then
o-o
my father lied.
o-o
He told me
o-o
that after
o-o
awhile I'd
o-o
get back my
o-o
smile.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can't imagine
o-o
what it'd be
o-o
like to lose
o-o
someone so close.
o-o
While still young.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Neither can I.
o-o
It's still
o-o
surrealistic.
o-o
Then just six
o-o
years later
o-o
another
o-o
tragic death
o-o
assaulted me.
o-o
...
o-o
My brother
o-o
was killed
o-o
by a bomb
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How did ya cope?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I almost lost hope.
o-o
Then I realized
o-o
my mother
o-o
was killed by
o-o
incompetent city
o-o
officials.
o-o
They failed to time
o-o
pedestrian walk
o-o
signals to give
o-o
walkers a head start.
o-o
Before the green
o-o
light for cars.
o-o
And I realized,
o-o
that basically,
o-o
my brother was
o-o
in the Middle
o-o
East defending
o-o
profits for oil
o-o
companies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Is that why we're
o-o
in this graveyard?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
My mother and brother
o-o
are buried over there.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Buried
o-o
as a pair?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
With room to spare
o-o
for father
o-o
and me.
o-o
Over time I traced
o-o
the local
o-o
corruption
o-o
to the state level,
o-o
then to DC,
o-o
then to Congress
o-o
where they write
o-o
laws so corrupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah, corruption.
o-o
I wouldn't know
o-o
how to define it,
o-o
but I sure see
o-o
tons of that
o-o
...
o-o
shit.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's betrayal,
o-o
bribery,
o-o
cheating, and
o-o
coersion,
o-o
cronyism,
o-o
deceitfulness,
o-o
deluding, and
o-o
deviousness,
o-o
dishonesty,
o-o
duplicity, and
o-o
embezzelment,
o-o
entrapment,

fraud, and
o-o
graft,

o-o
Not to mention
o-o
lying,
o-o
...
o-o
and littering.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Littering?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's a gateway
o-o
crime.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If you think
o-o
I'm followin',
o-o
then one of us
o-o
is lost.

Like not picking
o-o
up dog poop,

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
A dog owner
o-o
doesn't pick up
o-o
her dog's poop
o-o
because begin-italics her end-italics dog
o-o
will poke its own poop
o-o
with his snout.
o-o
She picks it up
o-o
so other dogs
o-o
don't poke the poop
o-o
with begin-italics their end-italics snouts.
o-o
In return,
o-o
those other dog
o-o
owners protect
o-o
her dog by
o-o
picking up their
o-o
dog's poop.
o-o
It's a
o-o
poop
o-o
scooper
o-o
loop.
o-o
And the same
o-o
kind of loop
o-o
works with
o-o
face masks
o-o
during an
o-o
epidemic,
o-o
but with coughs
o-o
and sneezes
o-o
and spittle
o-o
instead of
o-o
poop.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What the
o-o
...
o-o
poo?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Corruption
o-o
of that loop
o-o
happens when
o-o
someone fails
o-o
to bend over
o-o
and scoop
o-o
their dog's poop.
o-o
It's an example
o-o
of corruption
o-o
in general.
o-o
It's when someone
o-o
gets something
o-o
by ignoring
o-o
the suffering
o-o
of others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So over hyphen-here reaching?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Greedily
o-o
over hyphen-here reaching
o-o
for what they want
o-o
while ignoring
o-o
the suffering
o-o
they inflict
o-o
on others.
o-o
I fight to
o-o
remind them
o-o
that's not OK.

Fighting against

I've got

Can I see it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's for

o-o
only.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's it say?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's a graphic.
o-o
It reminds me
o-o
to kick ass.
o-o
To fight against
o-o
corruption.
o-o
And never
o-o
give up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Who's your
o-o
target?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I've hit a
o-o
turning point.
o-o
Originally
o-o
I thought the
o-o
enemy was
o-o
capitalism,
o-o
and that
o-o
socialism
o-o
was the
o-o
opposite.
o-o
But it's not
o-o
that simple.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hopefully
o-o
that wasn't
o-o
part of the
o-o
tatoo.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Then I fought against
o-o
the Republican party.
o-o
But recently
o-o
I realized
o-o
the opposition
o-o
Democratic
o-o
party
o-o
has been
o-o
infiltrated
o-o
by big hyphen-here money
o-o
donors
o-o
who want
o-o
Republicans
o-o
to win.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I too just learned
o-o
about this trick.
o-o
And that the fight
o-o
between
o-o
left and right's
o-o
just a
o-o
distraction
o-o
tactic.
o-o
It's like what
o-o
a magician
o-o
doin' magic
o-o
does.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Mistreat rabbits?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Entertain
o-o
with one hand
o-o
to distract
o-o
attention
o-o
away from the
o-o
other hand
o-o
that's doin'
o-o
the sneaky
o-o
trick.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Now that I
o-o
know the
o-o
Republican
o-o
party isn't
o-o
the real
o-o
enemy,
o-o
my anger's
o-o
getting thick.
o-o
So I need to
o-o
figure out,
o-o
and soon,
o-o
whose butt
o-o
I should kick.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think I've found
o-o
the tipping point.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The place
o-o
on a cow
o-o
that can tip
o-o
them over?
o-o
Not that I've
o-o
ever,
o-o
well,
o-o
recently,
o-o
tried tipping
o-o
a cow.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
but that path's blocked.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Is it padlocked?
o-o
I can pick
o-o
some locks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's a huge
o-o
barrier.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's the
o-o
blockage?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Math.
o-o
It's blockin' me
o-o
from findin'
o-o
the whackin'
o-o
point that'll
o-o
turn the world
o-o
right side up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Math is dreary
o-o
to me.
o-o
Yet I got
o-o
as far as
o-o
algebra
o-o
and trig and
o-o
statistics
o-o
without
o-o
successfully
o-o
using my
o-o
protractor
o-o
to commit
o-o
hari-kari.
o-o
What d'you wanna
o-o
know about?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wanna
o-o
figure out
o-o
how votes should
o-o
be counted
o-o
to get results
o-o
that're fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I don't know
o-o
how to get there.
o-o
But I do know
o-o
someone who
o-o
maybe can
o-o
unravel
o-o
that puzzle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can he help me
o-o
with my
o-o
struggle?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wrong gender.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Who's she?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
She's a math prof.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
A professor
o-o
of math?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes, at the state
o-o
university.
o-o
That's where I got
o-o
my degree.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I couldn't cope
o-o
with even
o-o
community college.
o-o
Textbooks hold
o-o
weasely words
o-o
that try to drag
o-o
my brain to
o-o
useless
o-o
destinations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you're a loser.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But I'm tryin'
o-o
not to be.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So stand up
o-o
and fight!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But I'm not
o-o
brainy.
o-o
Fighting
o-o
against math
o-o
would be
o-o
a bloodbath.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What took you
o-o
this far?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm short
o-o
'n not handsome.
o-o
So workin' hard
o-o
to earn money
o-o
is all I've got
o-o
to keep my word-fiance
o-o
happy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
What's so special
o-o
about her?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
She appreciates me,
o-o
even though
o-o
I'm notta hunk
o-o
surrounded
o-o
by adoring
o-o
women.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
All you need is one.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do you have someone?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I have my Willie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoa!
o-o
Say what?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
My partner's name
o-o
is Willie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are you two happy?
o-o
You and your
o-o
...
o-o
Willie?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You just need
o-o
to study.
o-o
School's not
o-o
that hard.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I have
o-o
some kind of
o-o
leak
o-o
in my brain.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Can you read?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Only for a bit.
o-o
Then my eyes hurt.
o-o
The words on a
o-o
page are
o-o
literally
o-o
a pain to
o-o
look at.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Do the
o-o
words in a book
o-o
gallop across
o-o
the page like
o-o
buffalo
o-o
in a
o-o
frenzied
o-o
stampede?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
how did you
o-o
get into
o-o
my head?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Have you tried
o-o
color hyphen-here tinted
o-o
glasses?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Your words sound
o-o
as squishy as
o-o
a banana.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll send you
o-o
a text
o-o
with a link
o-o
to where you can
o-o
find out more.
o-o
Anyways,
o-o
do you want me
o-o
to arrange a
o-o
meeting with this
o-o
math professor?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'Kay but only
o-o
if she can
o-o
explain things in
o-o
spoken words 'n
o-o
not use jargon,
o-o
or academic
o-o
speak.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I think she can
o-o
be OK with that.
o-o
'N maybe I can
o-o
translate if that's
o-o
what you really
o-o
need.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's what I need.
o-o
What d'you need?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
In my early
o-o
youth we were so
o-o
happy then,
o-o
even though
o-o
our home was
o-o
cramped,
o-o
and money
o-o
we lacked.
o-o
Then the world
o-o
turned upside down.
o-o
My smile
o-o
became a
o-o
frown.
o-o
I saw suffering
o-o
that I hadn't seen
o-o
before.
o-o
And I traced
o-o
the cause of
o-o
suffering to
o-o
corruption in
o-o
government.
o-o
Those ...
o-o
grrr
o-o
... politicians
o-o
are the puppets
o-o
of greedy
o-o
money huggers.
o-o
Now I want to
o-o
send them to hell,
o-o
those greedy
o-o
evil
o-o
muggers.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Which ones?
o-o
The politicians
o-o
or the big
o-o
campaign contributors?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Whoever
o-o
is most to blame.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They're both clueless
o-o
from what I
o-o
can tell.
o-o
They know money
o-o
works like
o-o
puppet strings.
o-o
But they're
o-o
clueless about
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
and blocking tricks.
o-o
Can we fight
o-o
against cluelessness?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If it will help to
o-o
carry a banner
o-o
that says begin-italics End 
o-o
Cluelessness Now end-italics
o-o
I will.
o-o
I'll fight against
o-o
whoever's to blame.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How do you aim
o-o
to tame
o-o
the circus
o-o
...
o-o
of elephants
o-o
and donkeys
o-o
and stupid
o-o
goats, ...
o-o
I mean
o-o
stupid voters?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I call on the spirits
o-o
of the dead here
o-o
to inspire me
o-o
to find a way
o-o
to shine a light
o-o
on corruption.
o-o
I want a light
o-o
that's so bright
o-o
that even evil
o-o
money huggers
o-o
and egotistic
o-o
puppets
o-o
cannot fight back.
o-o
Not with their wealth,
o-o
not with lawyers,
o-o
and not with
o-o
help from my
o-o
distant cousin
o-o
Dimley
o-o
who gets paid
o-o
to make clever
o-o
gifs,
o-o
those short
o-o
videos,
o-o
that attack
o-o
political
o-o
candidates.
o-o
I know that light
o-o
casts out darkness.
o-o
In that light
o-o
the path to better times
o-o
will appear.
o-o
Until that happens
o-o
I'll keep on
o-o
fighting.
o-o
Fighting with words.
o-o
Fighting with deeds.
o-o
Doing whatever it takes
o-o
to bring good times
o-o
back to us,
o-o
the voters, the
o-o
majority.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whatever it takes?
o-o
Yeah, it seems
o-o
it'll take some
o-o
lookin' into
o-o
mathematics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm willing to
o-o
help you fight
o-o
against your fear
o-o
of math.
o-o
Let's do this!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm ready
o-o
to fight!
o-o
Let's find out
o-o
how to turn
o-o
the world
o-o
right side up.
o-o
I just hope there's
o-o
no evil fractions.
o-o
I'd rather
o-o
encounter
o-o
pirates or
o-o
snakes.
o-o
Or even a
o-o
volcano
o-o
ready to
o-o
erupt.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Rise up
o-o
dead spirits!
o-o
Help us
o-o
avenge
o-o
your deaths
o-o
at the hands
o-o
of the
o-o
corrupt!
