o-o
That tactic

evades hefty

tax rates.
sentence-next
o-o
So an extra

it misses me.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the key is

ownin' a biz?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Indeed.

The ones you own,

Yup.
sentence-next

The paperwork's

ambee sings-damien amenn

That's because

grocery stores

pay for lots

big corporations

To see what

The way it was

cutting

o-o
That equipment

Now a

can do it all.
sentence-next
o-o
From making
o-o
an album to

selling it
o-o
online.
sentence-next
o-o
So that pinch point,

is gone.
