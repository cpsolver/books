<h1>Scene 3, Behind The Political Curtain</h1>
<p class="action">Action: Damien is sitting in a folding chair, then stands when Congressman Finckster enters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Sorry to keep you waiting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thank you for your time Congressman Finckster.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Come into my office. Please pardon the mess. I keep hearing promises that someone will clean this all up, but, alas, it was hit by a fresh tornado.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I knew that politics was messy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;While I'm looking for bugs, would you like some cold pizza?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Not if that's where the bugs have been. Anyway, the cheeze looks more counterfeit than a spray-on tan. So no thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Oh not those kinds of bugs. There are spies in the world of politics, and they'd love to hear what I'll say. Speaking of which, please turn off your phone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;[turns off smartphone] Oh sure.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Jordon told me to trust you with behind-the-curtain and under-the-trap-door kinds of magic that go on in politics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's what I'd really like to know.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Let's start with what you probably think you know. There are names for the left like liberals, environmentalists, and workers. And there are names for the right, such as conservatives, capitalists, and, lately, racists. But those are just distractions. Entertaining distractions. They're useful to distract from the big conflict.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's bigger than the conflict between left and right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Allow me to introduce you to a new way to look at politics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My brain is empty and ready to be filled.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;The much bigger conflict is between the political up and the political down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Political up? Political down? What the heck?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;The political up, that's where most of the voters are.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Voters of which political party?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Both parties.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How can that be?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Ah, you too have failed to notice that both parties are controlled by people with money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That part I knew.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;The political down is where the biggest election campaign contributions come from. The money source that lifts us high in the polls, or dashes us onto the rocks in a primary election.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;You mean rich folks, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Of course they're all rich, but some rich people are in the political up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Pardon me, I'm as confused as if I just stepped out of a high-capacity industrial laundry washer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Just like most voters. That's what the political down wants. That's why they avoid being named.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But among themselves they call themselves the political down?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;No, that's just how I think of them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Please go on, this is blindingly illuminating.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Of course the political down prefers our party, the Republican party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I see that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;But also the political down has infiltrated the Democratic party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wait a moment. Why would the political down give money to both parties? That's as stupid as betting on both horses in a two-horse race.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Ah, here's a big secret. They only assist Democratic candidates during <i>primary</i> elections.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, they use money to influence who wins each Democratic <i>primary</i> election. But in the general election they just support the Republican candidates?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Brilliant, isn't it? More dazzling than a smiling model in an auto ad. Of course I'm simplifying a bit.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now I'm beginning to see why we, er, most voters, dislike both candidates, the Republican <i>and</i> the Democrat. Nothing personal, of course.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;We know that as politicians we're stuck in the middle, between voters and our biggest campaign contributors, so no offence taken. Hopefully you now see why voters are distracted by the entertaining conflict between left and right. It's the modern-day equivalent of ancient Roman rulers who distracted plebians with bloody fighting among slaves in their immense Colosseum. Except that modern-day plebians get to vote which slave, er, puppet, wins the staged fight.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;With their clout, what does the political down really care about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Profits for the businesses they own. What especially delights them are tax breaks for their businesses. And when they can get a legal monopoly they cling to it like a drowning man clings to a floating tree branch.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Lower taxes and no competition. Wow, what a sweet deal. It sounds as though their lobbying efforts amount to corruption. Am I wrong?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;You are right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So I'm confused. The Republican party seems to care about some non-business issues such as abortions, and gay marriage, Christian values, immigration, and such, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;They do put those things on the flag they fly. But taxes, and ideally subsidies and monopolies, are their real priorities.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now I think I'm seeing why neither political party really gives a damn about protecting coral reefs, fixing climate change, giving homeless folks an assist, or listening to what dolphins have to say. The down folks use religious issues to divide and distract.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Here's another division tactic. Money can fund extreme liberal agendas. Like when the LGB category got extended to include queers and transgenders. That frightens many to the Republican side.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah voters who fall for the idea that the enemy of their enemy is their friend.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;That's a powerful divide and conquer tactic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;About monopolies, of course I know I can't start a business that competes with one of theirs. What else should I know?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Indeed, you can't start an insurance company, can't practice law without a law degree, and can't offer health advice as a smiling host on TV.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Those make sense.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;You also can't earn much money selling the herb stevia as a sweetener for drinks because laws block stevia from appearing on grocery shelves next to sugar or next to artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So stevia is a natural sweetener, but can't be sold where it would cut into profits for sugar companies and the makers of artificial sweeteners?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Yup, and speaking of sugar, long ago Congress passed laws against buying sugar that's grown outside the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is that so?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Here in the states we pay almost twice the price compared to other nations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Coffee would taste a bit sweeter without that price hike.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;And it's easy to hide the giving of funds to both sides. In fact there are two brothers in Florida in the sugar biz. One brother is a Republican who gives buckets of money to Republican politicians. The other brother is a Democrat who gives buckets of money to Democratic politicians. Ain't that sweet?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And as hard to follow as a rat chased by a cat. So they don't give a damn about left or right? They just lobby for sugar ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;subsidies. And the canals that enable Florida farmers to grow sugar cane. But the biggest profits come from converting sugar cane into sugar, and that's what's done by the businesses those bros own.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's a sour deal for us. But don't some rich folks prefer the Democratic party?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Lots of lawyers get lots of their business from Democratic voters, so they like Democratic politicians. And then there are industries that subdivide into left and right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh? I thought I was following you down main street, but you just ducked into a dark alley.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Banks prefer the Republican party, while credit unions prefer the Democratic party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wow! I think I now see who's in the political down, and why they oppose us, the voters, in the political up. But how do so very few rich folks outvote us, the non-rich, who outnumber them? Like hairs outnumber whiskers on a walrus.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;There's something in politics called vote splitting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What do spitting goats have to do with politics?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Not goats. Votes. As in voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Vote spitting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Not spitting, although long ago there was lots of spitting in politics. It's splitting, vote splitting, and it's the election version of divide and conquer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, vote splitting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;That's it!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And divide and conquer, isn't that the battle tactic armies use when they separate soldiers from one another? And then they can attack the smaller groups one at a time?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Yes, and in fact, voting is rooted in war and fighting. That's why women didn't vote. They weren't counted because they didn't fight. Of course those counting experts never met my brother's ex-wife. Anyway, the counting was done to figure out how many soldiers would be in each gang. And then the smallest gangs negotiate with one another and join forces. Otherwise they get slaughtered.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So the winner is the side that joins the most gangs into just one very big army?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Yes, and the remaining gangs join together into one opposition army. So it comes down to two armies. And that's where size matters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so long ago voting began as a way to count potential army sizes. And the smaller army surrenders?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Saves a lot of dying, no? And when splitting can't be done physically, then splitting psychologically works too. In politics, that's what religious differences are used for.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how does this vote splitting work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Well, it involves math.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear, you mean, mathematics?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Indeed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;In my opinion math's the devil's favorite form of torture. If I had to choose between doing just one page of math homework, or standing under a big fir tree getting cut down, I'd be there yelling <i>timber!</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;I don't like it either. And I don't understand vote splitting well enough to clearly explain how it all works. I just know that it works. So we, the politicians, are powerless to fight it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;You said there are distractions. How can just distractions hide this vote splitting so effectively?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;You've heard of the electoral college? And gerrymandering?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I admit long ago I wondered if Jerry Mander was someone important. Now I realize those are about the fight between Republicans versus Democrats.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;That's why news reporters are not blocked from writing and speaking about those distracting topics of unfairness.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Which now I know helps to distract from, and hide, the real fight between the political up and the political down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;And you've heard of the money bonus that a third-party presidential candidate can get if they get more than a certain percent of the vote?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Aha! That's a tactic to split votes away from ... well who?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Third parties are almost always on the left. At least in the US. Whenever needed they're quietly seeded with funds from conservatives. That splits votes away from the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I see. It just affects that distracting balance between left and right.</i> <p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;And if a conservative third-party candidate begins to do well in the polls, they get a bribe to drop out. That concentrates conservative voters' ballots on the single Republican nominee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And now I see why news media and those slippery political ads don't have as much influence as many people assume. The splitting of votes among candidates during primaries, that's their key to controlling you politicians like puppets, er, well, like I'm not sure what.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;That's not what I like to hear, yet between you and me, you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And yet we have social media, so surely some bright wits are calling attention to these dirty politics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;To deal with that the political down hires critics to write blogs, post memes, and tweet photoshopped photos that support absurd conspiracy theories. [refine later] Plus they hire coders to make bots that upvote their propaganda, and downvote the truth.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I had wondered why some people online attack with such anger. It's partly 'cause they're getting paid for that as a job?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Yup. Mister Mischievious from Michigan is getting paid to inspire Furious Fiona from Florida to re-post the clever meme he created to trash Hillary Clinton. And you should know attack ads also work. Because lots of voters get swayed by believing that expression <i>the enemy of my enemy is my friend</i>.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's stupid. Don't they see that just means they're shooting at the same target?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;And getting hit by friendly fire! Ah yes, stupidity is easy to exploit. And it's more common than ants at a picnic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I'm figuring this out. It's not like I expected.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;There is one bit of history worth knowing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh I hate history. Cramming more facts about the Alamo and the Civil War into my head might crowd out what I've learned.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;This is simple. Back before primary elections became normal, vote splitting was obvious. That's because each political party offered two or even three candidates. But if one big party offered just one candidate, that solo one won.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, 'cause voters in other parties split their votes among their similar candidates.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;So the winning strategy came to be for each party to have their own primary election to discover which politician deserved the solo spot in what we now call the general election.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah! Now the splitting is hidden in primaries where the winner is never from the wrong party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Indeed! You learn fast! So here's a test.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear lord! I hate tests! And this might be about history no less.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Let go of that foolish fear. This answer should be clear.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;[sighs] OK</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;What helped Barack Obama win the two thousand eight Democratic primary election against Hillary Clinton?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Based on what you've taught me, Republicans were involved.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Right, er left, er, correct, so far.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So people in the political down must have given money to Obama to defeat their bigger enemy, Clinton.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Correct so far.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And they probably thought, believed, assumed, that a black man couldn't win the general election. Is that right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;You did it! That's right! Although of course we cannot trace all the money, but that's sure to have been a part of what happened.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Those folks must have been dumbfounded when the winner was an African American.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;And that provides an example of a tactic that wouldn't work if vote splitting were not a problem.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;If the unfair vote splitting were solved, there could be two or three candidates per party in the general election. Then that blocking kind of tactic would not work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what can be done to fix this mess?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;I really don't know, and don't care. The political stress was giving my ulcers their own ulcers, so I retired. That's why I can tell you this stuff. But remember you didn't learn any of this from me. If you go to newspaper reporters with these insights I will shine some light on the skeletons in the closet of your friend Jordon who asked me to trust you.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I won't be a snitch or fink. And anyway I can't yet link the problem of vote splitting to a solution. So I need to learn some more. Who would know how vote splitting can be solved?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Probably that would be a professor of mathematics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear, just the thought of math scares me so!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Well I've got to go. I wish you luck in understanding yet more so maybe someday you can help clean up this political mess. In the meantime, the political world is upside down. Voters allow the rich to be at the top. Yes, politicians have all been bought. But as voters you've got more power than the X-Men and Justice League and a swarm of locusts put together.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you think maybe this can be solved?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Eventually. Hopefully. Someday voters will get to the top. And us politicians will become <i>your</i> puppets. But until vote splitting is solved we are puppets of wealthy business owners.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm seeing a bit of hope for a fix from mischievious politics. The solution, whatever it should be, I hope it comes quickly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckster:</span>&#160;Good luck! But remember, you didn't hear any of this from me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thank you Congressman for clearing up the mess in my brain. It's good to know I haven't yet gone insane. You've tilted my head to better see the political terrain. Now I know the the greedy rich distract us with left versus right. Yet up versus down, that's the real fight.</p>
