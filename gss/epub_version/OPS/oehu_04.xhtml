<h1>Scene 3, Behind The Political Curtain</h1>
<p class="action">Action: Damien is sitting in folding chair, then stands when Congressman Finckhster enters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Sorry to keep you waiting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thank you for your time Congressman Finckhster.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Come into my office. Please pardon the mess.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I know that politics is messy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;While I'm looking for bugs, would you like some cold pizza?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;The cheeze looks fake, so no thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;I always have to look for bugs. There are those who would love to learn what we'll say. Speaking of which, please turn off your phone.</p>
<p class="action">Action: Damien turns off smartphone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh sure.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Matt told me to trust you with secrets about how politics really works.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's what I'd really like to know.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Let's start with what you probably think you know. There are names for the left like liberals, progressives, workers, and more. And there are names for the right, such as conservatives, Christians, Wall Street, and more. But those are just distractions. Entertaining distractions. They are useful to distract from the big conflict.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's bigger than the conflict between left and right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Allow me to introduce you to a new way to look at politics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My brain is empty and ready to be filled.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;The much bigger conflict is between the political up and the political down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Political up? Political down?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;The political up, that's where most of the voters are.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Voters of which political party?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Both parties.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How can that be?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Ah, you too have failed to notice that both parties are controlled by people with money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That part I knew.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;The political down is where the biggest election campaign contributions come from.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;You mean rich folks, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Of course they are all rich, but some rich people are in the political up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Pardon me, I'm lost.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Just like most of the voters. That's what the political down wants. That is why they avoid being named.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But among themselves they call themselves the political down?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;No, that's just how I think of them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Please go on, this is so illuminating.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Of course the political down prefers our party, the Republican party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I see that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;But also the political down has infiltrated the Democratic party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wait a moment. Why would the political down give money to both parties? That's a waste.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Ah, here's a big secret. They only care about the Democratic primary elections.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, they use money to influence who wins each Democratic primary [extend "i" sound] election. But in the general election they just support the Republican candidates?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Brilliant, isn't it?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now I am beginning to see why we, er, most voters, dislike both candidates, the Republican <b>and</b> the Democrat. Nothing personal, of course.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;We know that as politicians we are stuck in the middle, between voters and our biggest campaign contributors, so no offence taken. You are now seeing why the voters are distracted by the entertaining conflict between left and right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I see. But please tell me, what does the political down care about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Profits for the businesses they own. Especially, what they really, really, really, want are taxes to be lower for their businesses. And when they can get a legal monopoly they will cling to it with everything they've got.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Because it brings so much money. It sounds as though their lobbying efforts amount to corruption. Am I wrong?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;You are right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So I'm confused. The Republican party seems to care about some non-business issues such as abortions, and gay marriage, Christian values, immigration, and such, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Not really. Of course they say those things matter. And they are minor annoyances. But those are ignored when things such as taxes and monopolies are at stake. Moral issues serve as entertaining distractions between left and right. They take away attention from up and down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now I think I'm seeing why neither political party really gives a damn about helping starving people, protecting rare animals and the environment, climate change, and such. Those issues are used by the down folks to divide and to distract the voters. <p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Plus sometimes money is used to fund extreme liberal causes. Like when the LBG category got extended to include queer and transgender folks. That frightens lots of voters to the Republican party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah voters who fall for the idea that the enemy of their enemy is their friend.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;It's a divide and conquer tactic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What else should I know about monopolies? I know that's why I cannot start a business that competes with one of theirs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Indeed, you can't start a bank, can't start an insurance company, can't practice law without a law degree, can't offer health advice without a medical degree.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Those make sense.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;You also can't earn much money selling the herb stevia as a sweetener for drinks because laws block stevia from appearing on grocery shelves next to sugar or next to artificial sweeteners.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So stevia is a natural sweetener, but can't be sold where it would cut into profits for sugar companies and the makers of artificial sweeteners?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Yup, and speaking of sugar, long ago Congress passed laws against buying sugar that's grown outside the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is that so?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;The result is that here in the states we pay twice as much as the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So without that monopolistic law, we would pay half the price?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Indeed, these legal monopolies force consumers to buy from the businesses that are owned by people in the political down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And those in the political down give money to the candidates in both parties?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;In fact there are two brothers in Florida in the sugar biz. One brother is a Republican, the other a Democrat. They each give lots of money to politicians in "their" party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So they don't give a damn about left or right? They just lobby for sugar ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;subsidies. And the canals that help the Florida farmers grow sugar cane. But the biggest profits come from converting sugar cane into sugar, and that's what's done by the businesses those brothers own.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This is making lots of sense. And yet there are some rich folks who seem to prefer the Democratic party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Lots of lawyers get lots of their business from Democratic voters, so they like Democratic politicians. And then there are industries that subdivide into left and right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Banks prefer the Republican party, while credit unions prefer the Democratic party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wow! I think I now see who's in the political down, and why they oppose us, the voters, in the political up. But how do so very few rich folks outvote us, the non-rich, who greatly outnumber them?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;There's something in politics called vote splitting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What do spitting goats have to do with politics?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Not goats. Votes. As in voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Vote spitting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Not spitting, although long ago there was lots of spitting in politics. It's splitting, vote splitting, and it's the election version of divide and conquer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, vote splitting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;That's it!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And divide and conquer, isn't that the battle tactic armies use when they separate soldiers or ships or whatever from one another? And then they can attack the much smaller groups one at a time?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Yes, and in fact, politics is rooted in war and fighting. That's why women didn't vote. They weren't counted because they didn't fight. The counting was done to figure out how many soldiers would be in each group. And then the smallest groups negotiate with one another and join forces. Otherwise they get slaughtered.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So the winner was the side that joined the most groups into just one big group?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Yes, and the remaining groups had to join into one opposition group. So it came down to two groups. And counting determined who outnumbered who.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;In reverse, the best tactic was to split up the enemy army, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Indeed, and when the splitting can't be done physically, then splitting psychologically works too.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so long ago voting just served to count the potential army sizes. And the smaller army surrendered?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Saves a lot of dying, no?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how does this vote splitting work with votes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Well, it involves math.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear, you mean, mathematics?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Indeed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I hate math.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;I don't like it either. And I don't understand vote splitting well enough to clearly explain how it all works. I just know that it works. So we, the politicians, are powerless to fight it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;You said there are distractions. How can just distractions hide this vote splitting so effectively?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;You've heard of the electoral college? And gerrymandering?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I've heard lots about those unfair things.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;They serve to focus voters on the fight between left and right. That's why news reporters are not blocked from writing and speaking about those topics of unfairness.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Which I now know helps to hide, distract from, the real fight between the political up and the political down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;And you've heard of the money bonus that a third-party presidential candidate can get if they get more than a certain percent of the vote?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Aha! That's a tactic to split votes away from ... well who?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Third parties are always on the left. Sometimes they are quietly given funds by people on the right, who want to split votes away from the Democratic nominee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I see. It just affects that distracting balance between left and right. And now I am realizing why I rarely see a conservative third party. I suppose any conservative third-party candidates get offered money to drop out so they don't split votes away from the Republican nominee?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;You've got it!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And now I see why news media and those awful political ads don't have as much influence as many people think. The splitting of votes among candidates in the primary elections of both parties, that's their key to controlling you politicians like puppets, er, well, like I'm not sure what.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;That's not what I like to hear, yet between you and me, you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And yet we have social media, so surely some folks are calling attention to these dirty political tactics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Ah, but they get lots of downvotes and criticism from a few folks who are happy to get paid to write comments, blogs, websites, and such stuff. And they are backed by bots that are rented by the organizations that serve the political down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I had wondered why some people online attack with such anger. It's partly (be)cause they are getting paid for that as a job?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Yup. And you should know attack ads do work because lots of voters get swayed by believing that expression "the enemy of my enemy is my friend".</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's stupid. Don't they see that just means they are shooting at the same target?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;And getting hit by friendly fire! Ah yes, stupidity is easy to exploit.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Finally I'm figuring this out. What I've learned is not what I expected it to be about.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;There is one bit of history worth knowing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh I hate history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;This is simple. Vote splitting used to be obvious in the U.S. because often there were two or maybe even three candidates from the same political party. So voters who liked that party split their votes among the similar candidates. In that case the winning strategy was for a party to have only one candidate from that party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Just one candidate per party. That was a winning strategy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Yes, if the other parties offered more than just one candidate.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I'm getting this.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Good, but don't tell anyone else what I'm telling you.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Of course not.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;So voters who liked the party with just one candidate automatically concentrated their votes on just that one candidate, causing that candidate to win. That's what led to creating what we call primary elections. And now each party nominates just a single candidate.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's a useful bit of history I didn't know. It explains why each party offers just one nominee. And I suppose vote splitting is why we have just two political parties?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Indeed! You learn fast! So here's a test.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear Lord! I hate tests! And this might be about history no less.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Let go of that foolish fear. This will be pretty easy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;[sighs] OK</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;What helped Barack Obama win the two thousand eight Democratic primary election against Hillary Clinton?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Based on what you've taught me, Republicans were involved.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Right, er left, er, correct, so far.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So people in the political down must have given money to Obama to defeat their bigger enemy, Hillary.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Correct so far.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And they probably thought, believed, assumed, that a black man could not win the general election. Is that right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;You did it! That's right! Although of course we cannot trace all the money, but that's sure to have been a part of what happened.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Those folks must have been dumbfounded when he won.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;And that provides an example of a tactic that wouldn't work if vote splitting were not a problem.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;If the unfair vote splitting were solved, there could be two or three candidates per party in the general election. Then that blocking kind of tactic would not work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what can be done to fix this mess?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;I really don't know, and don't care. I'm retiring at the end of my term. That's why I can tell you this stuff. But remember you didn't learn any of this from me. If you go to newspaper reporters with these insights I will shine some light on the skeletons in the closet of your friend Matt who asked me to trust you.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I won't be a snitch or fink. And anyway I don't yet know how the problem of vote splitting can be solved. So I need to learn some more. Who would know how vote splitting can be solved?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Probably that would be a professor of mathematics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear, just the thought of math scares me so!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Well I've got to go. I wish you luck in understanding yet more so maybe someday you can help clean up this political mess. In the meantime, the political world is upside down. Voters put the rich at the top. Yes, politicians have all been bought. But as voters you have got more power than you realize.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you think maybe this can be solved?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Eventually. Hopefully, someday voters will be at the top. And us politicians will become <i>your</i> puppets. But until vote splitting is solved we are puppets of wealthy business owners.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It can't come soon enough. Again, thank you so much for your time Congressman Finckhster.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Finckhster:</span>&#160;Good luck, but always remember, you didn't hear any of this from me.</p>
