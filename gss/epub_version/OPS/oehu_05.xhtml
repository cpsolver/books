<h1>Scene 4, Fighting Against Darkness</h1>
<p class="action">Action: Desha is sitting on a stone bench eating a cookie. Damien walks to face her.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You're way late.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Are you Desha?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Obviously. Who else would be in this spot in this cemetary?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Nice to meet you. I'm Damien.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Of course.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thanks for meeting with me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;For nothing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's the meaning of "de nada" in Spanish.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah I know. My mom is Puerto Rican.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Then why did you ask?</p>
<p class="action">Action: Damien rolls his eyes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;You said you wanted to meet with me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Congressman Finckhster said I should meet with you.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;To discuss why politics is so dysfunctional, you said.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Damn right! It's so so so dysfunctional.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Did he tell you about vote splitting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What do goats have to do with politics?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Not goats. Not spitting. Vote splitting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Splitting votes in half? That's a half-wit idea.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Not splitting ballots. Splitting voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's murder. Yes politicians do murder innocent people by their flawed laws.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's not what vote splitting is.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Then it sounds quite esoteric. What's important is that too many people are suffering under corruption.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, corruption is bad. It's like leaving just four squares of toilet paper on a toilet paper roll.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;It's millions of times worse. Corruption kills by allowing gun makers to push assault rifles into the hands of mentally unbalanced young males. Corruption kills through economic suffering that leads to homelessness, overdoses, suicide, homicide, and pedestrians killed by DUI drivers. And the companion of corruption is despair. Life is so unfair.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Well, since vote splitting is at the root of unfair elections, do you want to hear about it?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Tell me how you think it makes a difference.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Here's a way to understand it. Suppose there are four politicians.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What are their names?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I don't know, this is just a generic example.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You describe them, I'll name them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Two of them are puppets of wealthy business owners. The other two promise to reduce corruption, so they are more popular.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The names of the first two are Pinoke and Oscar.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Pinoke is a nickname for Pinochio, the puppet. And Oscar's last name is the Grouch. He lives in trash just like corrupt politicians.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, OK.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The other two are named Barack, 'cause we can hope for change, and Hypatia 'cause women should rule.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;With these four candidates, who would win?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Either Barack or Hypatia, obviously, 'cause voters want less corruption. They don't want puppets, not Pinoke, not Oscar.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Right, the voters would get what they want, if money were not involved.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So, now you'll say that advertising will change the minds of voters?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Only a few would fall for that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So tell me, why does money change who wins?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wealthy business owners, they meet in private and choose which of the puppets to concentrate their money on. If they choose Pinoke, then they tell Oscar to drop out of the race, and they bribe him with a favor.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Or a cookie. Either way, that would make Oscar more of a grouch. That would leave Pinoke and Hypatia and Barack.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So who would win that three-way race?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, now I see. Voters would split their votes between Barack and Hypatia, making it easier for Pinoke to win.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And with money for attack ads against Barack and Hypatia, and news coverage that favors their puppet Pinoke, that's usually enough to tip the balance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;A puppet wins. That's unfair because more voters prefer either Barack or Hypatia.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's what I've learned. But I don't know how to make elections fair.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;We voters can announce this deception, and get voters to concentrate their votes on either Barack or Hypatia.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But who decides which candidate to abandon?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;We the voters could get one to drop out, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;There's another backup trick. Wealthy business owners would give some money to yet another candidate who also promises to reduce corruption.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Let's name this one Ghandi. Yes, it's a whack-a-mole situation. Money is too tempting for lots of folks, especially egotistic politicians. Adding more candidates, that would further split the voters, making it yet easier for a single puppet to win.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And that's why each party nominates just one candidate for the general [extend first syllable] election, so vote splitting doesn't happen there.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, that makes sense. And that makes it even more obvious why we have just two main parties.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yup. And years ago the puppet masters got a law passed to give funding to a third-party presidential candidate who gets more than five percent of the vote.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I thought that was a good thing. A way to fight against money in politics. Now I see it as seduction. It suckers liberals into splitting their votes. While conservatives blindly concentrate their votes on just one candidate.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;You learn fast.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I have a degree in political science. But they never taught us this.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This is why the unfairness is hidden. It's hidden by numbers, and numbers to me are scary.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What scares me is that our planet is losing snow leopards and elephants, and rhinocerous ... ... es, and dolphins, and corral reefs, and plant species that could cure and feed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And that's why you got into politics?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;At the age of fourteen, ... my mother died. And that is when lots of people, especially my father, lied. He and they said everything would turn out fine.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I can't imagine what it would be like to lose someone so close at such a young age.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I can't either. It's still unreal. Especially because just six years later my brother was killed in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How did you cope?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I almost lost hope. Then I realized my mother was killed by incompetent city officials. They failed to time pedestrian walk signals to give walkers a head start. Before the green light for cars. And I realized, that basically, my brother was defending profits for oil companies in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is that why we're in this graveyard?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;My mother and brother are buried over there.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;When at last I realized the real causes of their deaths, I decided to kick some ... sense into the political world. And I've been fighting since.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And who are you fighting now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I've hit a turning point. For awhile, I thought the enemy was capitalism. I thought that socialism was the opposite.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And it's not?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;It's not that simple. Then I fought against the Republican party. But recently I realized the Democratic party has been infiltrated by big-money donors.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I too just learned the Republican party is not the real enemy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I want to figure out whose butt I should kick. But I'm stuck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I've found the tipping point.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The place where a little effort can make a huge change?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, but that path's blocked.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;By what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;By math. It's blocking me from figuring out how to turn the world rightside up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I've had some math. What do you want to understand?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How should votes be counted to get results that are really fair?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I don't know. But I do know someone who might know the answer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Can he teach us ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Not he but she.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Who is she?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;She's a math prof.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;A professor of math?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Yes, at the state university. That's where I got my degree.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I couldn't cope with even the community college. And textbooks don't work for me. I can't go where printed words try to take me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So you're a loser.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You're choosing to give up instead of fight. That's losing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm not brainy. How can I fight against math?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What took you this far?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm short and not handsome. So working hard to earn money is all I've got to keep my fiance happy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's so special about her?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;She appreciates me. And like I said, I'm not a popular guy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;All you need is one.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Do you have someone?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I have my Willie.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Pardon?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;My partner's name is Willie.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Are you two happy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's your disability? Did you never learn to read? Do the words move around on the page? Do books put you to sleep? There has to be something more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It hurts to read. The words are a pain to look at.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Have you tried color-tinted glasses?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh? I don't follow.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Of course not. Never mind. I'll send you to a website where you can find out yet more. In the meantime, do you want me to arrange a meeting with this math professor?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK but only if she can explain things in spoken words and not use lots of jargon, or academic speak.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I think she can be OK with that. And maybe I can translate if that's what you really need.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It's what I need. What is it that you need?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;In my early youth we were so happy then, even though money we lacked. Then the world turned upside down. I saw suffering that I hadn't seen before. And I traced the cause of suffering to corruption in government, especially Congress. Those ... ... politicians are the puppets of greedy money huggers. Now I want to send them to hell, those greedy evil buggers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Which ones? The politicians or the big campaign contributors?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Whoever is most to blame.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;From what I can tell, they both are clueless about why money works so well, as puppet strings. Can we fight against cluelessness?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'll fight against whoever is to blame. I call on the spirits of the dead here to inspire me to find a way to shine a light on corruption. I want a light that is so bright that even evil money huggers and egotistic puppets cannot fight back. Not with their wealth, not with lawyers, not through hired workers, and not with all they think they have. I know that light casts out darkness. In that light the path to better times will appear. Until that happens I'll keep on fighting. Fighting with words. Fighting with deeds. Doing whatever it takes to bring good times back to us, the voters, the majority.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Whatever it takes? Yes, it seems it will take some looking into mathematics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm willing to help you fight against your fear of mathematics. Let's do this!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm ready to fight! I just hope there's no evil fractions. Otherwise I'm ready to find out how to turn the world right side up.</p>
