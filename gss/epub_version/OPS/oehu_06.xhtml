<h1>Scene 5, Math Breakthrough</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Hi professor Mata. This is Damien.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Welcome Desha and Damien. Let's go into the classroom to talk. By the way, Damien, do you like pi?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;In the morning pie seems so irrational.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So you do like math?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;As I said by text, he doesn't know much about math.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And classrooms are scary, spooky, and terrifying. They bring back such awful memories of being teased for getting Cs, especially in math and history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Nonsense I say. I bet you're smart. You just didn't get a good start. Can you count?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;One two three four and of course there's more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Can you go the other way?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Four three two one.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;What comes after one?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Nothing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In a way you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;What's nothing called in math?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh, zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ah yes, wonderful magical zero!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's so special about zero?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Zero as a digit was not known in ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Rome. But in ancient China they put their counting marks inside a square. So when no marks are there, it's an empty square. That changed to a circle as the idea spread to India then Arabic-speaking universities. And then a student took it to Rome and became pope. He could calculate faster than the Italians who still used counting marks, so it spread and was part of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;When Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;With that digit zero sailors could make realistic maps, and navigate away from coastlines, far out to sea, where winds blow to Brazil and then back around the southern tip of Africa. That route bypassed the monopoly that Arabic-speaking Muslims had on the land-based silk road to China.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So it was zero, not Columbus, who got us to the new world?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, in fact, the Portugese discovered Brazil before fourteen ninety two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so that's why people in Brazil speak Portugese instead of Spanish.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Interesting!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, zero is a big-deal number.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's even bigger than that. Without zero scientists couldn't have put a man on the moon, or put rovers on the planet Mars, or photographed the rings of Saturn from within those rings. And those are just a few of the things that make zero so incredibly fantastic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Got it. But how is that relevant for getting fair elections?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;There is something still very new, not yet taught in public schools, that can take civilization, humanity, us, to the next level where elections are fair. But to get there you need to appreciate the power of a name.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, what's the name?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;A name without it's meaning is useless. Concepts come first.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Every test I took cared more about the names than the concepts.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's because names, definitions, and dates and such are easier to test.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Isn't that upside down? Testing what's less important?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You are bright. So let's get rid of your fear of fractions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ancient Babylonians and Romans also disliked fractions. It's because they lacked the digit zero. That's no big deal for addition and subtraction. Those are just shortcuts for counting up and counting down. Multiplication is a shortcut for adding the same number many times. But division, without the big-deal zero, that's a mess. So leaving things as fractions, without doing the division they represent, that's what they did until zero arrived.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now we do have zero, yet I have to use fractions every day. Adding them and subtracting those suckers, that overloads my brain.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;If fractions you loathe, then this question I pose. Why do you use them?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I have no choice. It's part of my job.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Are you a musician?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's that got to do with fractions?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Musicians cannot avoid fractions. They count by two, or three, or four, or six, or eight, but never by five or ten.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I build custom staircases. Tape measures are marked in halves, quarters, eighths, and sixteenths. I do rejoice when the measurement doesn't involve something like five sixteenths.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Use decimal numbers. That's what the whole world uses, as part of the metric system, except of course here in the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I can't use metric units, that would get me fired.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Decimal numbers work with inches too. Just get a tape measure with decimal markings for inches!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh, if only I could do so, that would be great! I could avoid the fractions I hate!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Here, look at this tape measure.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, it's marked with ten units per inch! When I measure I could write the numbers as tenths or hundredths. And it shows eighths as well. This is, well, swell!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And adding and subtracting them is as easy as dollars and cents.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I hadn't stopped to consider that a fraction is a division problem undone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How do I get one of these?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Use the magic math word "decimal" when you search for "tape measure."</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, words can be powerful.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You learn fast! Now about your fear of fractions. Ancient Romans also had that fear. They liked the number twelve. That's why daytime is divided into twelve hours.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So that's why we have twenty four hours per day?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Indeed. The number twelve can be divided by two and three and four and six, and yield a nice result of six or four or three or two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wondered why time is measured in numbers that aren't in multiples of ten.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Sexagesimal.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Pardon?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's the name for using sixty as a base. That's what the ancient Babylonians chose. Sixty divides without remainders by two and three and four and five and six and ten and twelve and fifteen and twenty and thirty also. That's why an hour has sixty minutes. And why a minute has sixty seconds.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So here in the states, we alone deal with fractions for our inches. And our feet plus inches instead of decimal feet or decimal inches keeps us from the decimal world that everyone else enjoys. A lack of fractions! That's a world I'd like to see.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So are fractions less scary now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yes, I'm not in fear of them as much. But sometimes I get stuck not knowing when to do division, in the right sequence with addition and subtraction.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's just the trick of algebra.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear lord please forget I said that! I've heard horror stories about algebra.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Albert Einstein, when he was young, also had trouble with algebra.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But he was the ultimate math whiz.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;His uncle told him to think of algebra as a whodunnit mystery, where the identity of mister X is unknown, and the facts are clues, and the goal is to figure out who is mister X?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Why didn't my algebra teacher teach that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Because that is never the answer to a standardized test question.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, I think I'm seeing your point. Division asks the question: "What number needs to be multiplied times the number on the bottom of a fraction to get the number on the top of the fraction?" Right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! Now you understand some key ideas of math. There's lots more, and yet, so much of it would make sense if math history were taught. It even explains why we say fourteen and thirteen but not two-teen and one-teen.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, thirteen is where we start naming numbers non-specially. Is that why thirteen has a reputation as unlucky?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Probably. Getting stuck with a measurement of thirteen instead of twelve makes a big difference when it has to be divided.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So here's another useful secret. Division is disguised under other names, like ratio, rate, proportion, average, percentage, percent, and the word per, and of course fractions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So a fraction is just a lazy way to deal with division?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You've got it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;It sounds like we need a revolution in how math is taught.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Another revolution? How many do you want?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;As many as it takes to get things right side up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Oh I do wish there was more time so we could talk about beautiful balanced equations, and what's behind calculus, and why quadratic equations ....</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Fortunately we don't have that much time.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Of course, of course! And anyway, computers can do math better than students.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Wait a minute! Math textbooks and math professors are teaching us thinking skills that computers can easily handle? Why is that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ironic isn't it? Spelling, grammar, reading aloud, arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, calculus, historical facts, geography, memorization, all of that is done better by computers. Yet we try to teach all that in school.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What are computers not good at doing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Inventing, writing documents that are of value, interpreting data, composing music, graphic design, software development, creative things like that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Would that include designing custom staircases?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Definitely.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Those are the skills that employers want.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So schools teach what computers can do better? And schools fail to teach the skills that computers are not good at, but that businesses really want?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Alas, the academic world is upside down for students and teachers and employers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;For all of us, the academic world is upside down. No wonder I often recall so little of what I learned in college. Computers do it better. We really do need a revolution in how math, and more, is taught.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Computers lack the ability to understand concepts. Yet that's what's most important to learn.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So the definitions, terminology, memorization of facts, grammar rules, math rules, and such are what professors teach because textbooks focus on them, and the standardized tests test those things. But really it's the concepts that schools should teach?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Alas, yes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now I'm much less afraid of mathematics. Now am I ready to understand the math behind voting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Indeed you are. Counting is all that's needed most of the time. And there are no fractions involved. Of course zero does arise.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Hurray! No fractions!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So let's explore how votes need to be counted for results to be fair.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Finally!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So how do you think voting should be done?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm not a math wiz, as you know.</p>
<p class="action">Action: Professor Mata turns to face Damien</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;How about you? What would you guess?</p>
<p class="action">Action: Damien thinks silently for a moment.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How about using five stars like Amazon does?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's a good start. And why is that so much better?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If Amazon used just one star per item like on a paper ballot, that wouldn't be enough information. So what's needed in elections is more information.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! Yes indeed! So if stars were used in elections, and the highest count of stars indicated the winner, how could you, as a voter, get some extra influence?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Let's consider a different scenario. Let's suppose you're in the audience at a talent contest, and the MC announces that the loudness of clapping will determine who wins. How can you get extra influence?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I don't know.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Nor do I.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You could clap really loud for your favorites, and just pretend to clap for the others.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That would be cheating.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In a talent contest, maybe, maybe not. At theater events, that's disrespectful. But in an election, with money on the line, that's just freedom of expression. It's democracy, but with an unfair kind of vote counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, it's fighting! Done on ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So when I rate things on Amazon I should only use one star or five stars?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;If you do that on Amazon you're being a jerk. But if that star rating were used in elections, where so much is at stake, that tactic can work great.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm following things so far.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, you understand one of the issues with ballots and counting methods. Just collecting more information is not enough. How the information is counted to identify a winner is so important to get right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you're saying that the five star method won't work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ah, I should take a step back. There are two parts to any voting method. There is the ballot and there is the counting of those ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What kind of ballot do we use now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Almost every nation in the world uses what's now called the single-mark ballot.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Because we can only mark a single choice?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Right. And there is just one way to count that kind of ballot. Which is why until recently that ballot didn't have a name. The counting method has different names. It's the enemy of fair voting so it's worth learning its names. In the academic world it's called plurality voting. In Canada and other British places it's called "first past the post."</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's it called here in the states?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's just called voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah! With no name it becomes harder to fight against!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So that's the enemy, the single-mark ballot?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So what's the name of a ballot where each candidate can be ranked at a different level, like on Amazon?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's called a ranked ballot, or a score ballot, depending on how it's counted.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Brain freeze! I'm beginning to see why better voting methods have not been adopted already. Is that difference really important?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;To get the math right, yes. But both types are better than what we use now.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Isn't anything better than what we use now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Almost anything. There's one big exception. That's using points, where each voter is given a limited number of points to distribute among the choices.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Is that because a jerk could give all his points to a single alternative?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, that's one of its flaws. Just about any other method is fairer because what we use now is so primitive.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So using ballots that are like Amazon stars .... Wait a moment. Does this mean voting has to be done electronically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Paper ballots must be allowed 'cause when my brother was overseas that's how he voted. And voting machines can be hacked.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Paper ballots with ovals to mark work just fine. Of course columns of ovals are needed for the preference levels. Let's say seven columns. The columns would be labelled "first choice," "second choice," "third choice," and so on up to "seventh choice." If one candidate gets more than one of its ovals marked, just count the highest rank.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Anyone who can't mark those right shouldn't be allowed to vote.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you were saying that some ways of counting those ballots are better than others?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Exactly! If everyone is honest, then simple counting works fine.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Simple counting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;If there are five columns, a marked oval in the "first choice" column would be like marking five Amazon stars, a mark in the "second choice" column would be like marking four Amazon stars, and so on down to a mark in the "fifth choice" column would be like marking one Amazon star.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's simple?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;A computer would take care of doing that counting. You would just mark the correct column.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Even hand counting the ballots that way would be easy. For simple counting the candidate with the highest such count would win, and if everyone is honest, then that works fine.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Fat chance of that! Honesty I mean.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes when money is involved, as in politics, then that simple way of counting ratings is vulnerable to tactics that give strategic voters extra influence. Like in the clapping tactic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm curious. What happens when Amazon customers realize they can get extra influence by skipping the middle ratings?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Then Amazon can change the way the stars are counted. Actually they already do. They can get even more sophisticated if that's needed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm confused. I understand how the ballots work, but I can't imagine a way to count votes that's not like any of what we've been discussing. I thought I was following, but now I'm getting discouraged.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Take a deep breath! And give yourself an A plus! You two are learning more and faster than anyone else I've tried to explain this to.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Really? Or are you just trying to, well, I don't know. This is so different from academic learning I've had in the past.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's because you really care about this topic. That's really what makes the difference between good and bad grades.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My world is upside down. Money is on the line. So let's keep going.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You said that the five star Amazon kind of ballot has two names. Which name applies to the kind of simple counting we have been talking about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That kind of ballot is asking for a score or a rating. It's called a score ballot. It allows a voter to indicate how strongly the voter feels about who they like and dislike.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And that's why marking just the strongest scores, just one or five stars, and not marking two, three, or four stars, is such a big deal?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Exactly! A plus again!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how should we be counting ballots? For elections where voters will use tactics to increase their influence?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Before we move on to what I think is the best kind of vote counting, here is an interesting simple kind of improvement.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Consider the same kind of ballot we use now, the single-mark ballot, but change the instructions and allow the voter to mark more than just one candidate. That's called approval voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, because you either approve each candidate or leave their name unmarked.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This sounds like Facebook, where people can upvote.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Right you are.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;On Reddit we can upvote and downvote. That's more information, so is that better?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Only if it's counted as three rating levels.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Three levels?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Remember zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, an upvote, which is like a thumbs up, is like plus one? And a downvote, which is like a thumbs down, is like minus one? And neither up nor down is like neutral, like zero?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;If counted right that could work, but five levels is better than three. And when there are lots and lots of candidates then up to about twelve levels would work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But not unlucky thirteen.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Since you brought it up, I'm guessing that approval voting might be fair?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It would work OK in primary elections because the winner would always be from the correct party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But in general elections the wrong party must not win, so there it wouldn't work, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Right, we need more than just one column of ballot ovals for full fairness.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wait a moment! A simple change in instructions on primary election ballots would increase fairness. Wouldn't that be an easy change to make?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;I'm not politically savvy, so I don't know. I just know the math behind ballot counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What about general elections? How should those multiple columns of ovals be counted?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You're finally ready to learn about ranked ballots. They look the same as score ballots with ovals, but they are counted differently. It defeats the tactic of just marking the highest levels and lowest levels.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;[speaks to himself] That's ranking.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Now the hard part is how can the preferences be counted in a way that's fair?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That is hard!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This is why so few people understand how voting should be done. But guess anyway.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK. Maybe we could start by looking at just the top candidate on each ballot.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Go on.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the candidate who gets the fewest top marks gets eliminated?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And that can be repeated. Until just one candidate remains.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;What you're describing has many different names. Here let's call it instant runoff voting. Among friends, or when a smartphone isn't handy, that method works. And it works well enough that it has been used in real elections. In fact it's used in Maine, and Australia, in San Francisco, and a few other places.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So I didn't guess right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This is hard stuff. You did better than I expected you would. So give yourself lots of credit for the basic idea of using something besides counting marks and looking for the biggest count.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;However instant runoff voting was used in the city of Burlington, in Vermont, and it failed. The winner was clearly not the most popular candidate. So that's not the best we can do. Can you think of a way to better identify which candidate should get eliminated first?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm stumped.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You've heard of the electoral college?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's so bad!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ah, but one thing it gets quite right. The winner has to get more than half the votes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's called a majority.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, and notice that if one of the candidates gets a majority, then vote splitting can't happen.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, getting more than half the votes is a must. But how can that happen when there are more than two candidates?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Take a guess.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This is hard.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In sports, how are teams ranked?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Aren't teams ranked based on how many games each team wins?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;How many teams compete in each game?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Just two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And what's that called, two at a time?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I dunno.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Two at a time, thats a pair at a time.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Pairwise. That's the name. So how would that work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Pairwise, ... ah, counting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, pairwise counting. It's a very important thing. How would that work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It's counting, but it's beyond what my brain can handle.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;If it were sports teams, then, well, the worst team would be the one that loses all of its pairwise matches.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! Keep on going.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So the loser of all the pairwise contests would be eliminated.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And then we'd look for the next loser, from the remaining teams, er, candidates.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And when there is just one team, or candidate, remaining, that would be the winner, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! And the shortcut approach is to look for the candidate who wins all of their pairwise comparisons. The academic world calls that a Condorcet winner.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Condorcet, that sounds stuffy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's named after a French guy whose title was the Marques de Condorcet. For a long time he was thought to be the first person to publish a description of that method.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I can see, as you say, the concept is the key. Yet on a test, students would be asked to recall his name. That's dumb.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I see. A Condorcet winner would get more than half the votes, a majority, without any vote splitting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;If this is such a great way to count, why isn't it used for elections?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Because sometimes there is no Condorcet winner. Using the elimination approach, it can reach a point where none of the candidates loses all its pairwise contests.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Then what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;There are backup ways to resolve those cases. Or better yet, there are methods that don't first look for Condorcet winners or losers. Instead they use the pairwise counts in ways that don't need to do anything special.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That sounds like it's magic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In a way, it is magic. After all, magic is simply something we don't yet fully understand. That's the beauty of advanced mathematics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Is there some method you like, that you could explain, in a way that makes that magic understandable?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes. But before that will make sense I should ask you how many pairwise counts are involved in each pairwise comparison.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll guess two. If the two candidates are named Pinoke and Oscar, there's the count for how many voters, well, support, uh, Pinoke over Oscar. And there's the other count, of how many voters prefer Oscar over Pinoke.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And will those two numbers always add up to the total number of voters?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think so.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, but what if some voters rank Pinoke and Oscar as equally acceptable?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, that means there will be a third number. The number of voters who rank them as equally acceptable.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! Yes there are three numbers for each pairwise comparison. But when summarized, the third count can be omitted. This means the pairwise numbers can be put into a table, a square grid.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So that means each column and each row would be labelled with the names of the candidates. So it would be a four by four grid if the candidates are named Pinoke, Oscar, Barack, and Hypatia?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Very good! Now you're ready to see the magic of the counting method I like the best. It re-arranges the sequence of candidates, in the rows and columns, until the biggest pairwise counts move into the upper-right triangular area of the grid, and the smallest pairwise counts move into the remaining lower-left triangular area of the grid. Then that sequence indicates not only who is most popular, but who is second most popular, who is third most popular, and so on down to who is least popular.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's that method called?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;The Condorcet Kemeny method.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And is that the fairest method?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;More research is needed to figure out which method is best.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I thought math was supposed to be precise. So how can it be wishy washy too?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;There's a mathematical proof that proves it's not possible for there to be a voting method that has no flaws.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So math doesn't have all the answers?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's complicated.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Sounds like life and relationships.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;There are some characteristics, criteria, that voting methods pass or fail. Math geeks know which methods fail which criteria. But there has been no research to measure how <i>often</i> each method passes or fails each one.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why hasn't that research been done?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Who would pay for it?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Whoever pays for research in mathematics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Most of that funding comes from the government. But they don't want research that reveals the unfairness of how they count election ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;More corruption! Since that's a bit of a dead end, please tell us more about what is known.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So far we've been talking about how to choose a mayor, governor, or president. That's not hard. But what happens when there are lots of seats to fill, like in Congress?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Brain overload!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Oh right. Instead, imagine a group of friends choosing a second pizza topping for a pizza they will share. How would the second topping be chosen?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Couldn't the second-most popular candidate, er, topping, be chosen?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Let's try a more obvious metaphor. Imagine that five wolves and four sheep vote on what to eat for dinner.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ha! The five wolves would eat the four sheep! And claim it's fair because it's democracy!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So you see that just getting a majority is not the full picture.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, if districts were filled with wolves and sheep, and each district had slightly more wolves than sheep, then every district would elect a wolf, and congress would be filled with wolves.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's not far from what it is now. Except with white males.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In Europe, instead of wolves and sheep, they have multiple political parties, more than just two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Like wolves and sheep and goats and pigs?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Sure. On the ballot each voter marks their favorite political party. During the counting they do adjustments to make sure that each party gets their fair share of seats in parliament.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Does that work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It hides the unfairness of still using single-mark ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And from reading the news in Europe they have as much corruption as the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So getting back to voting here in the United States, suppose each district filled two seats in the house of representatives.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That means districts would be twice the size of existing districts, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Very good!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, half as many districts, and two seats per district. Got it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Of course the most popular candidate wins the first seat.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So how is the second seat filled? In a way that's fair. For the sheep, and goats, and pigs? Or maybe I should say, for women to get the representation we deserve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Using simple math, a computer can calculate which voters are well-represented by the first-seat winner.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Makes sense.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Their ballots would have their influence reduced. The remaining voters would have full influence for their ballots. And then the same popularity calculation method reveals which candidate is most popular. And that candidate wins the second seat in the district.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm guessing that most districts would elect one Republican and one Democrat. Is that right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Typically yes, assuming both parties offer good candidates.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So there would be more than just one Republican and one Democrat in the race?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, because vote splitting cannot happen. And we need to allow for the possibility that one of the parties only offers disliked candidates, while the other party offers better candidates.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, if, say, the Republican party only offered puppet candidates, like Pinoke and Oscar, and the Democratic party offered good candidates, like Barack and Hypatia, then both winners could be Democrats?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This seems like a very fair approach.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But if every district elects one Republican and one Democrat, then Congress would be tied. Even though the population is not evenly divided between the two parties.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;To fix that unfairness, we can make the districts a little bigger. And we reserve a few extra seats. Nationwide seats. Then we can do the party-based adjustment to figure out which party deserves to win each of those nationwide seats.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the party leaders would get to decide who should fill those seats? That doesn't seem fair to the voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's what's done in lots of European nations. And you're right. That's not fair. Far better is to identify the most popular of the un-elected candidates. The most popular such candidate from the correct party would fill that party's extra seat, and the process gets repeated. That approach takes control away from party insiders and gives control to the voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This makes sense. It certainly seems much much fairer than what we've got now.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But if the results are fair, and there is no vote splitting, then that means there would be lots more candidates, right? General elections would no longer be limited to one candidate per party, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And Desha you're bright.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;It's just counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And that's what the important parts of mathematics are mostly about, counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So how can the number of candidates be limited?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;A ballot question that asks voters to rank the political parties can give us the info we need to calculate the popularity of the parties. The most popular parties can be allowed to have two or three of their candidates in each race.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the least popular parties get excluded?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That makes sense to me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And a few third parties get one candidate each, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That would give small parties an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I don't like names, but this is getting complex. Is there a name for all of this?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It is sort of like a jigsaw puzzle with lots of pieces, and different pieces would work, and they have lots of names. But the only method that does all of what I've described under a single name is called VoteFair Ranking.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;FairVote?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;No, that's a different thing. FairVote is an organization that promotes instant runoff voting and something called the single transferable vote. They call those methods "ranked choice" voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's confusing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, intentionally.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what was the name again of what you like?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;VoteFair Ranking.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is there a less-specific name?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Pairwise counting. That's the most important part. Because pairwise counts reveal not just support but opposition.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So it's ranked ballots and pairwise counting that you recommend?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Plus adjustments we've discussed that give fuller representation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;To the sheep and goats and pigs defending themselves against the wolves.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how hard is it to do pairwise counting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;All the counting is done by computer, so a tap on the screen is all that's needed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So what's the barrier against the use of fairer ballots and pairwise counting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Up until a few decades ago, when computers came along, doing the math by hand was the big barrier.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But now we have computers, so what's stopping us now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Fear, especially a fear of math. And a lack of trust in math because many people don't trust what they don't understand.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And insiders within political parties. They don't want to lose their grip. And their puppet-masters, the biggest campaign contributors.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wouldn't the benefit of greater fairness persuade people to make the switch?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You are so naive.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Fairness is not what some people want. Fairness is what unhappy people want. They want their fair share of the economic pie.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And rich people want to protect their too-big slice of ecomomic pie, probably with ice cream on top.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Speaking of that, here are colored blocks that represent nine ballots, and the colors represent ice cream flavors.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Pretty colors! Which flavors?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Dark brown is chocolate.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Yum!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Pink is for strawberry.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm not a fan of pink.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This color represents mint chocolate chip.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And I presume the last color is vanilla.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But you haven't explained why you're pointing out these colored blocks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;With these ballot preferences the winning flavor can be mint chocolate chip, or strawberry, or vanilla, depending on which counting method is used.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so the counting method does matter!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Definitely. And yet, almost any method is better than what we've got now.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If elections were fair, what would change, politically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Yeah, especially for the unfortunate poor?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;The answer to that I don't know. For that you need to ask someone who understands both economics and game theory.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Game theory?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's an academic field that studies, well, it's difficult to describe, but it includes vote counting. I do know someone with those credentials, but he's at a university that's a four-hour drive away.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Do you think he would talk to us?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;I can ask him by email.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That would be great!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;He studies, and teaches about, economic history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh I do hate history as much as I did mathematics. And economics, that's more math.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This professor can make history fun.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is that possible?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You did great with mathematics. As for math in economics, it's just different names for money, such as profit, loss, debt, interest, and such.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll try.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;One more tip. Sometimes numbers are used as if they are impartial, especially in statistics. That's called "mathiness." It's a misuse of mathematics. Math doesn't lie, but liars like to sound like their use of numbers is real. But often it's just their fantasy. Got that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I admit I tend to distrust math until I do the counting or calculations myself.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what we learned is that pairwise counting is the key to less corruption in Washington DC. But do we need to remember that guy's name? Condolences, or something?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Pairwise counting includes Condorcet methods, and some non-Condorcet methods. So just remember the concept of pairwise counting. And needing more than half those votes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Half's a fraction I can recall.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Thank you for your wise insights. We'll share them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Remember you promised that you won't reveal where they came from.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, but why?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;I've got tenure, so I'm not likely to lose my job, but I can lose grants for my research projects.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, and some of your funds come from the government, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes. Lots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;When we bite the hand that feeds you we won't reveal who took us off our leashes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We can say we learned it from Wikipedia.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Only bits of it are in Wikipedia. That's because they require academic references for academic topics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And I suppose those references don't exist because governments don't fund such research.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This is all seeming like a giant conspiracy, except that it's in plain view.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;It's hidden behind the curtain of mathematics. That's a powerful barrier.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Fear of math keeps it well hidden.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;This makes it all the more special that you have taken the time to explain this to us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm extremely grateful. You've given me, us, more than I could ever have hoped for.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;I love these kinds of conversations. I wish textbooks and those dang standardized tests would allow me to teach more like this, without as much notation and terminology. The joy of math is in the concepts. That's what counts.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I'm beginning to see a fraction of that joy in mathematics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, one more thing. Since pairwise counting is a few years off, what can we do in this election to fight against vote splitting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Tell your friends, including the ones online, that current ballots are not asking "who is your favorite?" And if they want to say "none of the above," then marking a can't-win name is not the way to say that. And not voting does not express "none of the above." The way to defeat vote splitting is to hold their nose and mark a candidate who has a chance of winning. Otherwise they weaken the candidate they prefer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's helpful. Thanks!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Thanks again!</p>
