<h1>Scene 5, Math Breakthrough</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Hi professor Mata. This is Damien.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Welcome Desha and Damien. Let's go into the classroom to talk. By the way, Damien, do you like pi?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;In th' morning pie seems so irrational.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So you do like math?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;He doesn't know that in the math world those words have special meanings. Just assume he knows as much about math as Mozart knew about electronics. Plus he has a dreadful fear of fractions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Classrooms are scary, spooky, 'n terrifyin'. This one's bringin' back awful memories of bein' teased f'r gettin' Cs, 'specially in math 'n hist'ry.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Nonsense I say. I bet you're smart. You just didn't get a good start. Can you count?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;One two three four 'n of course there's more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Can you go the other way?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Four three two one.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;What comes after one?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Nothin'.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In a way you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;What's nothing called in math?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh, zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ah yes, wonderful magical zero!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's so special 'bout zero?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Zero as a digit was not known in ancient Egypt, Babylon, Greece, and Rome. But in ancient China they put their counting marks inside a square. So when no marks are there, it's an empty square. That changed to a circle as the idea spread to India then Arabic-speaking universities. And then a student took it to Rome and became pope. He could calculate faster than the Italians who still used counting marks, so it spread and was part of the Italian Renaissance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;When Leonardo painted the Mona Lisa, and Michelangelo carved the rock-hard anatomy of David.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;With that digit zero, sailors made realistic maps, and navigated far out into the Atlantic. That avoided the north-bound winds that block the path along the south coast of Africa. That path, which bumped into Brazil, took them around the southern tip of Africa. With that sea route Europeans bypassed the monopoly that Arabic-speaking Muslims had on the land-based silk road to China.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So it was the digit zero, not Columbus, that got us to the new world?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, in fact, the Portuguese discovered Brazil before fourteen ninety two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so that's why people in Brazil speak Portuguese 'nstead of Spanish.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Interesting!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, zero's a big-deal number.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;The digit zero. Not just zero. There have always been words like nothing, empty, ziltch, nought, nobody, none, naked, hungry, and moron. But saying two zero zero instead of two hundred, that's magic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So th' digit zero's a big deal.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's at the core of science and engineering. Without the digit zero scientists and engineers couldn't have put a man on the moon, or put rovers on the planet Mars, or photographed the rings of Saturn from within those rings. And those are just a few of the things that make the digit zero so incredibly fantastic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Got it. Bu' how's that relevant for gettin' fair elections?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;There's something still very new, not yet taught in public schools, that can take civilization, humanity, us, to the next level where elections are fair. But to get there you need to appreciate the power of a name.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, what's the name?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;A name without it's meaning is useless. Concepts come first.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Every test I took cared more about th' names than th' concepts.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I learned to spell <i>hypotenuse</i> before I learned it had nothing to do with hippos.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's because names and dates and such are easier to test.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Isn't that upside down? Testin' what's less important?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You are bright. So let's get rid of your fear of fractions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;<span class="highlight">Oh dear.</span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ancient Babylonians also disliked fractions. And so did the Romans. It's because they lacked the digit zero. That's no big deal for addition and subtraction and multiplication. Those are just shortcuts for counting up, counting down, and adding the same number many times. But division, without the big-deal zero, that's muddled and befuddled anarchy. So leaving things as fractions, without doing the division they represent, that's what they did until zero arrived.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now we do have th' digit zero, yet I have t' use fractions every day. Adding them 'n subtracting those suckers, tha' overloads my brain.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;If fractions you loathe, then this question I pose. Why do you use them?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I have no choice. It's part o' my job.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Are you a musician?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's that got to do with fractions?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Musicians cannot avoid fractions. They count by two, or three, or four, or six, or eight. But not by five or ten. Except maybe for some geeky modern jazz.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I build custom staircases. Tape measures are marked in halves, quarters, eighths, 'n sixteenths. I'm relieved when th' measurement doesn't involve somethin' like five sixteenths. 'S there a name for that phobia?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Use decimal numbers. That's what the whole world uses, as part of the metric system. Except of course here in the states.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I can't use metric units. That'd get me fired.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Decimal numbers work with inches too. Just get a tape measure with decimal markings for inches!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh, if only I could do so. That'd be great! I could avoid th' fractions I hate!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Here, look at this tape measure.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, it's marked wi' ten units per inch! When I measure I could write th' numbers as tenths or hundredths. 'N it shows eighths as well. This is, well, swell!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And adding and subtracting them is as easy as dollars and cents.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I hadn't stopped to consider that a fraction is a division problem undone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How do I get one o' these?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Use the magic math word <i>decimal</i> when you search for <i>tape measure</i>.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, words can be powerful.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You learn fast! Now about your fear of fractions. Ancient Romans, even though they fearlessly conquered most Mediterranean waterfront property, they too had that fear. They liked the number twelve. That's why daytime is divided into twelve hours.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So that's why we have twenty four hours per day?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Indeed. The number twelve can be divided by two and three and four and six, and yield a nice result of six or four or three or two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wondered why time is measured in numbers that aren't in multiples of ten.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Sexagesimal.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We're jumping from math to sex?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Sexagesimal is the name for using sixty as a base. That's what the ancient Babylonians chose. Sixty divides without remainders by two and three and four and five and six and ten and twelve and fifteen and twenty and thirty. That's why an hour has sixty minutes. And why a minute has sixty seconds.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So here in th' states, we alone deal wi' fractions for our inches. 'N our feet plus inches instead of decimal feet or decimal inches keeps us from th' decimal world tha' everyone else enjoys. A lack of fractions! That's a world I'd like t' see.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So are fractions a bit less scary?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yes, I'm not in fear of them as much. Bu' sometimes I get stuck not knowing when to do division, in th' right sequence with addition 'n subtraction.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's just the trick of algebra.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear lord please forget I said that! From what I've heard algebra's th' fifth horseman of th' apocalypse.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Albert Einstein, when he was young, also had trouble with algebra.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But he was a genius. And best known for E equals M C squared, the ultimate celebrity equation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;His uncle told him to think of algebra as a whodunnit mystery, where the identity of mister X is unknown, and the facts are clues, and the goal is to figure out who is mister X?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Why didn't my algebra teacher teach that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Because donning a Sherlock Holmes cap in class is discouraged. And <i>whodunnit</i> is never the answer to a standardized test question.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, I think I'm seein' your point. Division asks th' question: <i>What number needs to be multiplied times the number on the bottom of a fraction to get the number on the top of the fraction?</i> Right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! Now you understand some key ideas of math. Not enough to design a bridge I'd be willing to drive over. Of course there's lots more. And yet, so much of it would make sense if math history were taught with a focus on concepts. It even explains why we say fourteen and thirteen but not two-teen and one-teen.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, thirteen is where we start naming numbers non-specially. Is that why thirteen <span class="highlight">is so hated</span> that it's not used as a hotel room number?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Prob'bly. I sure feel unlucky when I'm stuck with a measurement of thirteen instead of twelve 'n have to divide it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Here's another useful secret. Division is disguised under other names. Like ratio, rate, proportion, average, percentage, percent, and the word per, and of course fractions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So a fraction's just a lazy way t' deal with division?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You've got it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;It sounds like we need a revolution in how math is taught.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Another revolution? How many d' ya want?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;As many as it takes to get things right side up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Oh I do wish there was more time so we could talk about beautiful balanced equations, and what's behind calculus, and why quadratic equations ....</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Fortunately we don't have that much time.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Of course, of course! And anyway, computers can do math better than students.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Wait a minute! Math textbooks and math professors are teaching us thinking skills that computers can easily handle? Why is that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ironic isn't it? Computers are better than humans at spelling, grammar, arithmetic, algebra, trigonometry, calculus, historical facts, geography, and memorization. Yet we try to teach all that in school.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What're computers not good at doing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Inventing, creating new solutions to problems, writing books worth reading, composing beautiful music, scripting videos worth watching, graphic design, software development, extracting meaning from data, creative things like that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Would that include designing custom staircases?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Definitely.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Those are th' skills that employers want.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So schools teach what computers can do better? And schools fail to teach the skills that computers are not good at, but that businesses really want? Wow! The world really really is upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Alas, the academic world is upside down for students and teachers and employers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;For all of us. No wonder I often recall so little of what I learned in college. Computers do it better. We really do need a revolution in how math, and more, is taught.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Computers lack the ability to understand concepts. Yet that's what's most important to learn.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So the definitions, terminology, memorization of facts, grammar rules, math rules, and such are what professors teach because textbooks focus on them, and the standardized tests test those things. But really it's the concepts that schools should teach?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Alas, yes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now I'm much less afraid o' mathematics. Now am I ready t' understand th' math behind voting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Indeed you are. Counting is all that's needed most of the time. And there are no fractions involved. Of course zero does arise.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Hurray! No fractions!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So let's explore how votes need to be counted for results to be fair.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Finally!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So how do you think voting should be done?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm not a math wiz, as you know.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;How about you Damien? What would you guess?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Uh, .... How 'bout using five stars? ... Like Amazon does.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's a good start. And why is that so much better?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If Amazon used just one star per item like on an 'lection ballot, tha' wouldn't be enough information. So what's needed in elections is more information.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! Yes indeed! So if stars were used in elections, and the highest count of stars indicated the winner, how could you, as a voter, get some extra influence?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Let's consider a different scenario. Let's suppose you're in the audience at a talent contest, and the emcee announces that the loudness of clapping will determine who wins. How can you get extra influence?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I dunno.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Nor do I.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You could clap really loud for your favorites, and just pretend to clap for the others.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That'd be cheating.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In a talent contest, maybe, maybe not. At theater events, that's disrespectful. But in an election, with money on the line, that's just freedom of expression. It's democracy, but with an unfair kind of vote counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, it's fighting! Done on ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So when I rate things on Amazon I should only use one star or five stars?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;If you do that on Amazon you're being a jerk. But if that star rating were used in elections, where so much is at stake, that tactic would work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm following things so far.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, you understand one of the issues with ballots and counting methods. Just collecting more information is not enough. How the information is counted to identify a winner is so important to get right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you're saying that th' five star method won't work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ah, I should take a step back. There are two parts to any voting method. There's the ballot and there's the counting of those ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What kind'a ballot d' we use now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Almost every nation in the world uses what's now called the single-mark ballot.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Because we can only mark a single choice?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Right. And there's just one way to count that kind of ballot. Which is why until recently that ballot didn't have a name. The counting method has different names. It's the enemy of fair voting so it's worth learning its names. In the academic world it's called <i>plurality voting</i>. In Canada and other British places it's called <i>first past the post</i>.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's it called here in th' states?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's just called voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah! With no name it becomes harder to fight against! Imagine protesting with a sign that says <span class="highlight"><i>End That Unnamed Bad Kind Of Vote Counting</i>.</span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So that's the enemy, th' single-mark ballot?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes. It is to democracy what a string and two old-style tin cans are to the telephone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So what's the name of a ballot where each candidate can be ranked at a different level, like on Amazon?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's called a ranked ballot, or a score ballot, depending on how it's counted.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Brain freeze big time! This must be why better voting methods haven't been adopted already. Is tha' difference really important?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;To get the math right, yes. But both types are better than what we use now.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Isn't anything better than what we use now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Almost anything. There's one big exception. That's using points, where each voter is given a limited number of points to distribute among the choices.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Is that because a jerk could give all his points to a single candidate?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's one of its flaws. Alas, it's so simple that it's seductive. Yet in the limbo contest of vote counting, even with the very low bar we're at now, the points approach wins the limbo contest as the lowest. Just about any other method would be like pole vaulting over the low we're at now.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So using ballots that are like Amazon stars .... Wait a moment. Does this mean voting has t' be done electronically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Paper ballots must be allowed. Lots of people vote by mail. That's what my brother did when he was overseas. And voting machines can be hacked.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Paper ballots with ovals to mark work just fine. Of course columns of ovals are needed for the preference levels. Let's say seven columns. The columns would be labelled <i>first choice</i>, <i>second choice</i>, <i>third choice</i>, and so on up to <i>seventh choice</i>. If a voter marks more than one oval for the same candidate, just count the highest rank. If the voter fails to mark any of a candidate's ovals, that candidate is put at the bottom <i>seventh choice</i>.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Anyone who can't mark those right is too stupid to be voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;You're sayin' some ways of counting those ballots are better than others?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Exactly! If everyone is honest, then simple counting works fine.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Simple counting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;If there are five columns, a marked oval in the <i>first choice</i> column would be like marking five Amazon stars, a mark in the <i>second choice</i> column would be like marking four Amazon stars, and so on down to a mark in the <i>fifth choice</i> column would be like marking one Amazon star.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's simple?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;A computer would take care of doing that counting. You would just mark the correct column for each candidate.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Even hand counting the ballots that way would be easy. For simple counting the candidate with the highest such count would win. If everyone is honest, then that works fine.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Fat chance of that! Honesty I mean. It seems to be getting less and less fashonable. In both business and politics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes when money is involved, as in politics, then that simple way of counting ratings is vulnerable to tactics that give strategic voters extra influence. Like in the clapping tactic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm curious. What happens when Amazon customers realize they can get extra influence by skipping the middle ratings?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Then Amazon can move the goalposts. They can count differently. Actually they already do. They can get even more sophisticated if that's needed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm confused. I understan' how th' ballots work. Bu' I can't imagine a way to count votes that's not like any of what we've been discussing. I thought I was following, but now I've stumbled up another dark alley.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Take a deep breath! Or two. And give yourself an A plus! You two are learning more and faster than anyone else I've tried to explain this to.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Really? Or are you just trying to, well, I dunno. This is so different from when my head got bonked with a book every time I made a mistake.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Tell me who did that and I'll bonk him in the balls.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This is different because you really care about this topic. That's really what makes the difference between good and bad grades.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My world is upside down. Money is on th' line. So let's keep going.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You said the five star Amazon kind of ballot has two names. Which name applies to the kind of simple counting we've been talking about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That kind of ballot is asking for a score or a rating. It's called a score ballot. It allows a voter to indicate how strongly the voter feels about who they like and dislike.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'N that's why marking just th' strongest scores, just one or five stars, 'n not marking two, three, or four stars, is such a big deal?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Exactly! A plus again!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how should we be counting ballots? For elections. Where voters will try to increase their influence.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Before we move on to what I think is the best kind of vote counting, here's an interesting simple kind of improvement.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Consider the same kind of ballot we use now, the single-mark ballot. But change the instructions and allow the voter to mark more than just one candidate. That's called approval voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, because you either approve each candidate or leave their name unmarked.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This sounds like Facebook, where people can upvote.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Right you are.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;On Reddit we can upvote and downvote. That's more information. So is that better?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Only if it's counted as three rating levels.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Three levels?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Remember zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, an upvote, which is like a thumbs up, is like plus one? And a downvote, which is like a thumbs down, is like minus one? And neither up nor down is like neutral, like zero?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;If counted right that could work. But using five levels collects more information than three. And when there are lots and lots of candidates then up to about twelve levels would work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But not unlucky thirteen.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Since ya brought it up, I'm guessing, approval voting might be fair?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It would work OK in primary elections because the winner would always be from the correct party.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But in general elections the wrong party must not win. So there it wouldn't work, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Right. We need more than just one column of ballot ovals for full fairness.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wait a moment! A simple change in instructions on primary election ballots would increase fairness. Wouldn't that be an easy change to make?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;I'm not politically savvy, so I don't know. I just know the math behind ballot counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What about general elections? How should those multiple columns of ovals be counted?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You're finally ready to learn about ranked ballots. They look the same as score ballots with ovals, but they're counted differently. It defeats the tactic of just marking the highest levels and lowest levels.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;[Speaks to himself.] That's ranking.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Now the hard part is, how can the preferences be counted in a way that's fair?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That is hard!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This is why so few people understand how voting should be done. But guess anyway.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK. Maybe we could start by looking at just the top candidate on each ballot.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Go on.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the candidate who gets the fewest top marks gets eliminated?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And that can be repeated. Until just one candidate remains.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;What you're describing has many different names. Here let's call it instant runoff voting. Among friends, or when a smartphone isn't handy, that method works. And it works well enough that it's been used in real elections. In fact it's used in Maine, and Australia, in San Francisco, and a few other places.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So I didn't guess right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This is hard stuff. Not as hard as calculating the square root of your social security number on an abacus. But you deserve lots of credit for the basic idea of using something besides counting marks and looking for the biggest count.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;However instant runoff voting was used in the city of Burlington, in Vermont, and it failed. The winner was clearly not the most popular candidate. So that's not the best we can do. Can you think of a way to better identify which candidate should get eliminated first?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm stumped.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You've heard of the electoral college?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's so bad!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Ah, but one thing it gets quite right. The winner has to get more than half the votes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's called a majority.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And notice that if one of the candidates gets a majority, then vote splitting can't happen. That's so important that Roberts Rules of Order insist on majority support for the winner.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So how do those rules say to count votes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Those rules don't say how to get a majority. Just that it's necessary. And those rules say not to use what here we're calling instant runoff voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So getting more than half the votes is a must. But how can that happen when there are more than two candidates?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Take a guess.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This is hard. Is it naptime yet?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Remember that money is your reward for figuring this out.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In sports, how are teams ranked?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Aren't teams ranked based on, ... well, ... I think they get points, or maybe lose points, from each game.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;How many teams compete in each game?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Just two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And what's that called, two at a time?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I dunno.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Two at a time, that's a pair at a time.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Pairwise. That's the name. So how would that work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Pairwise, ... ah, counting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, pairwise counting. It's a very important thing. How would that work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It's counting, but it's beyond what my brain can handle <span class="highlight">without using Mannie's Magic Brain Grow Elixer.</span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;If it were sports teams, then, well, the worst team would be the one that loses all of its pairwise matches.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! Keep on going.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So the loser of all the pairwise contests would be eliminated.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'N then we'd look for th' next loser, from th' remaining teams, er, candidates.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And when there's just one team, or candidate, remaining, that would be the winner, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! And the shortcut approach is to look for the candidate who wins all of their pairwise contests. The academic world calls that a Condorcet [pronounced cone-dor-SAY] winner.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Condorcet, that sounds stuffy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's named after a French guy whose title was the Marques de Condorcet. For a long time Europeans thought he was the first person to publish a description of that method.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I can see, as you say, the concept is the key. Yet on a test, students would be asked to recall, or recognize, his name. That's dumb.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I see. A Condorcet winner would get more than half the votes, a majority, without any vote splitting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;If this is such a great way to count, why isn't it used for elections?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Because sometimes there's no Condorcet winner. Using the elimination approach, it can reach a point where none of the candidates loses all its pairwise contests.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Then what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;There are backup ways to resolve those cases. Or better yet, there are methods that don't first look for Condorcet winners or losers. Instead they use the pairwise counts in ways that don't need to do anything special.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That sounds like magic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's the beautiful magic of advanced mathematics. After all, magic is simply something we don't yet fully understand.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Like how my landlord calculates my utility bill.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Is there some method you like, that you could explain, in a way that makes that magic understandable?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes. But before that will make sense I should ask you how many pairwise counts are involved in each pairwise comparison.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll guess two. If th' two candidates are named Pinoke and Oscar, there's th' count for how many voters, well, support, uh, Pinoke over Oscar. And there's th' other count, of how many voters prefer Oscar over Pinoke.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And will those two numbers always add up to the total number of voters?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think so.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, but what if some voters rank Pinoke and Oscar as equally acceptable?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, that means there will be a third number. The number of voters who rank them as equally acceptable.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Excellent! Yes there are three numbers for each pairwise comparison. But when summarized, the third count can be omitted. This means the pairwise numbers can be put into a table, a square grid. And each row would be labelled with the name of a candidate. And the columns would be labelled with the same names in the same sequence.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So if the candidates are named Pinoke, Oscar, Barack, and Hypatia, it would be a four by four grid, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Indeed. Now you're ready to see the magic of the counting method I like best. It re-arranges the sequence of candidates, in the rows and columns. The goal is to re-arrange the sequence until the biggest pairwise counts move into the upper-right triangular area of the grid, and the smallest pairwise counts move into the other half, the lower-left triangular area. Then we look at that sequence. It indicates not only who is most popular, but who is second most popular, who is third most popular, and so on down to who is least popular.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's that method called?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;The Condorcet Kemeny method.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'N is that th' fairest method?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;More research is needed to figure out which method is best.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I thought math was supposed to be precise. How can it be indecisive too?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Maybe that's the kind of math your landlord uses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;There's a mathematical proof that proves it's not possible for there to be a voting method that has no flaws.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So math doesn't have all the answers?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's complicated.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Sounds like life and relationships.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;There are some characteristics, criteria, that voting methods pass or fail. Math geeks know which counting methods fail which criteria. But there has been no research to measure how <i>often</i> each method passes or fails each one.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why hasn't that research been done?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Who would pay for it?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Whoever pays for research in mathematics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Most of that funding comes from the government. But they don't want research that reveals the unfairness of how they count election ballots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;More corruption!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Since that's a bit of a dead end, please tell us more about what's known.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So far we've been talking about how to choose a mayor, governor, or president. That's not hard. But what happens when there are lots of seats to fill, like in Congress?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Brain overload!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Oh right. Instead, imagine a group of friends choosing a second pizza topping for a pizza they will share. How would the second topping be chosen?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Couldn't th' second-most popular candidate, er, topping, be chosen?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Second-most popular has more than one meaning. So let's try a more obvious metaphor. Imagine that five wolves and four sheep vote on what to eat for dinner.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ha! The five wolves would eat the four sheep! And claim it's fair because it's democracy!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So us minorities, like th' sheep, need a way to fight against a majority.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The Bill of Rights is nice but that's not enough.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;As you see, just getting a majority is not the full picture.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I see somethin'. If districts were filled with wolves 'n sheep, 'n each district had slightly more wolves than sheep, then every district would elect a wolf. Then congress would be nothin' but wolves.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's not far from what it is now. Except with white males.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;In Europe, instead of wolves and sheep, they have a handful of political parties.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Like wolves and sheep and goats and pigs?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Sure. On the ballot each voter marks their favorite political party. Let's say that lots of voters mark the Pirate party. During counting, adjustments make sure that the Pirate party gets their fair share of seats in parliament.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Does that work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It hides the unfairness of still using single-mark ballots. Lots of people like it. Because they can point to someone in parliament and claim their vote helped elect that candidate.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;From reading news about Europe they have as much corruption as the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;So getting back to voting here in the United States, suppose each district filled two seats in the house of representatives.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That means districts would be twice the size of existing districts, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Very good!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, half as many districts, and two seats per district. Got it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Of course the most popular candidate wins the first seat.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So how is the second seat filled? In a way that's fair. For the sheep, and goats, and pigs? Or maybe I should say, for women to get the representation we deserve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Using simple math, a computer can calculate which voters are well-represented by the first-seat winner.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Makes sense.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Their ballots would have their influence greatly reduced, often all the way to zero. The remaining voters would have full influence for their ballots. Then the same popularity calculation method reveals which candidate is most popular. That candidate would win the second seat in the district.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm guessing that most districts would elect one Republican and one Democrat. Is that right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Typically yes, assuming both parties offer good candidates.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So there would be more than just one Republican 'n one Democrat in th' race?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, because vote splitting cannot happen. And we need to allow for the possibility that one of the parties only offers disliked candidates, while the other party offers better candidates.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, if, say, th' Republican party only offered puppet candidates, like Pinoke 'n Oscar, 'n th' Democratic party offered anti-corruption candidates, like Barack 'n Hypatia, then both winners could be Democrats?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This seems like a very fair approach.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But if every district elects one Republican and one Democrat, then Congress would be tied. Even though the population is not evenly divided between the two parties.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;To fix that unfairness, we can make the districts a little bigger. And we reserve a few extra seats. Nationwide seats. Then we can do the party-based adjustment to figure out which party deserves to win each of those nationwide seats.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the party leaders would get to decide who should fill those seats? That doesn't seem fair to the voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's what's done in lots of European nations. And you're right. That's not fair.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Then why did they choose that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;New voting methods have to get approved by people in power. They only accept a change that's likely to get themselves re-elected. Otherwise it would be as unlikely as turkeys voting in favor of Thanksgiving.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Another barrier!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Far fairer is to look at the ballots again to identify the most popular of the un-elected candidates. The most popular such candidate from the correct party would fill that party's extra seat. Then the process would get repeated. That approach takes control away from party insiders and gives control to the voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Tha' makes sense. It certainly seems much much fairer than what we've got now.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But if the results are fair, and there's no vote splitting, general elections would no longer be limited to one candidate per party, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That means there could be lots more candidates, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Desha you're bright.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;It's just counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;And that's what the important parts of mathematics are mostly about, counting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how can the ballot handle lots of candidates?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;A separate ballot question can ask voters to rank the political parties. That gives us the info we need to calculate the popularity of the parties.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Voting for parties? Is that really a thing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That's what lots of people in lots of nations do on their ballots. Using that info, the most popular parties can be allowed to have two or three of their candidates in each race.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the least popular parties get excluded?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That makes sense to me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And a few third parties get one candidate each, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That would give small parties an opportunity to grow.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I don't like names, but this is getting complex. Is there a name for all of this?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It is sort of like a jigsaw puzzle with lots of pieces, and different pieces would work, and they have lots of names. But the only method that does all of what I've described under a single name is called VoteFair Ranking.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;VoteFair?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;FairVote?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;VoteFair is the ranking method I like. FairVote is an organization that promotes instant runoff voting and something called the single transferable vote. They call those methods <i>ranked choice</i> voting.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's confusing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes, intentionally.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, you like VoteFair something. Is there a less-specific name?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Pairwise vote counting. That's the most important part. Because pairwise counts reveal not just support but opposition.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So it's ranked ballots and pairwise counting that you recommend?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Plus adjustments we've discussed that give fuller representation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;To the sheep and goats and pigs defending themselves against the wolves.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how hard's it t' do pairwise counting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;All the counting is done by computer, so a tap on the screen is all that's needed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So what's the barrier against using ranked ballots and pairwise counting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Up until a few decades ago, when computers came along, doing the math by hand was the big barrier.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But now we have computers, so what's stopping us now?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Fear. Especially a fear of math. Officially that's called mathematical anxiety. Lots of people have it 'cause many people don't trust what they don't understand.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Plus, insiders within the political parties don't want to lose their grip. And their puppet-masters, the biggest campaign contributors, don't want their puppet strings cut.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wouldn't th' benefit of greater fairness persuade people to make th' switch?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You are so na&#239;ve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Fairness is not what some people want. Fairness is what unhappy people want. They want their fair share of the economic pie.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And rich people want to protect their too-big slice of economic pie, probably with ice cream and three cherries on top.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Speaking of that, here are colored blocks that represent nine ballots, and the colors represent ice cream flavors.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Pretty colors! Which flavors?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Dark brown is chocolate.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Yum!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Pink is for strawberry.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm not a fan of pink.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This color represents mint chocolate chip.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And I presume the last color is vanilla.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But you haven't explained why you're pointing out these colored blocks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;With these ballot preferences the winning flavor can be mint chocolate chip, or strawberry, or vanilla, depending on which counting method is used.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so the counting method does matter!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Definitely. And yet, almost any method is better than what we've got now.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If elections were fair, what would change, politically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Yeah, especially for the unfortunate poor?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;The answer to that I don't know. For that you need to ask someone who understands both economics and game theory.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Game theory?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It's an academic field that studies, well, it's difficult to describe, but it includes vote counting. I do know someone with those credentials, but he's at a university that's a four-hour drive away.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;D' ya think he'd talk to us?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;I can ask him by email.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That'd be great!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;He studies, and teaches about, economic history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh I do hate hist'ry as much as I did mathematics. 'N economics, that's more math.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;This professor can make history fun.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is that possible?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You did great with mathematics. As for math in economics, it's just different names for money. Like profit, loss, debt, interest, <span class="highlight">and such.</span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll try.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;One more tip. There's something called <i>mathiness</i>. It's a misuse of mathematics. Math doesn't lie, but some liars use numbers when they lie.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Mathiness must be what my landlord's using.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I admit I tend to distrust math until I do the counting or calculations myself.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So, we've learned that pairwise vote counting is the key to less corruption in Washington DC. But do we need to remember that guy's name? Condolences, or something?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Pairwise vote counting includes Condorcet methods, and some non-Condorcet methods. So just remember the concept of pairwise counting. And needing more than half those votes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Half's a fraction I can recall. But I don't understand why ya made a big deal out of th' digit zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;It took our ancestors hundreds of years to make the leap from the number zero to the digit zero. To us, in hindsight, it's so simple. In a similar way people in the distant future will marvel that it took so long for us to use pairwise counting for counting votes. Zero as a digit changed the world in marvellous ways. Similarly pairwise vote counting will change the world in marvellous ways.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So just like we don't know what we've got til it's gone, we don't fully know what's missing until it can be seen in hindsight?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I was right. You <i>are</i> very bright.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;You've got this!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thank you for your wise insights. We'll share them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Remember you promised you won't reveal where they came from.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;OK, but why?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;I've got tenure, so I'm not likely to lose my job. But I can lose grants for my research projects.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, 'n some of your funds come from th' government, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Yes. Lots.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;When we bite the hand that feeds you we won't reveal who took us off our leashes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We can say we learned it from Wikipedia.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Only bits of it are in Wikipedia. That's because they require academic references, especially for mathematical topics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And I suppose those references don't exist because governments don't fund such research.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This is all seeming like a giant conspiracy, except that it's in plain view.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;It's hidden behind the curtain of mathematics. That's a powerful barrier.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Fear of math keeps it well hidden.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;This makes it all the more special that you've taken the time to explain this to us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm extremely grateful. You've given me, us, more than I could ever have hoped for.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;I love these kinds of conversations. I wish textbooks and those dang standardized tests would allow me to teach more like this, without as much notation and terminology. The joy of math is in the concepts. That's what counts.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I'm beginning to see a <i>fraction</i> of that joy in mathematics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, one more thing. Since pairwise counting is a few years off, what can we do in this election to fight against vote splitting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;Tell your friends, including the ones online, that current ballots are not asking <i>who is your favorite?</i> And if they want to say <i>none of the above</i>, then marking a can't-win name is not the way to say that. And not voting does not express <i>none of the above</i>. The way to defeat vote splitting is to vote in <i>both</i> primary and general elections. And especially they need to hold their nose and mark a candidate who has a chance of winning. Otherwise they weaken the candidate they prefer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's the best way to express <i>none of the above</i>?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Mata:</span>&#160;That choice doesn't fit on a ballot. <span class="highlight">That's what blogs, and reddit posts, and Jon Oliver TV segments, and protests are for.</span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Thank you! All of this has been so helpful.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thank you! You're a true guru. With what we've learned, I'm ready to burn down some corruption. 'N thanks for teaching me I'm not a third-wit loser.</p>
