<h1>Scene 2, Money Madness</h1>
<p class="action">Action: Damien enters, Matt does not get out of chair.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'ello mister Bigman. Grafton, my fiance's father, said you could teach me some money tricks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Shall we start with some licks? In the fridge is some mint chocolate chip ice cream. Want some?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's too rich for me. I'll take none.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Some folks like what's warm and fuzzy. But I prefer money. A wallet that's fat. What's better than that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Without money my world is upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;With money, my world is right side up. Yet I'm not smilin' 'cause there is so much more I could own. I can't afford my own jet, or a yacht, not there yet. Don't yet got all I want.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what's the trick? Of getting money?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;You've got to be willing to step on peoples' toes. Anything goes. That's the trick. That's how I earn my money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you put money before people?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Consider this. The love of money is built into our language. We have so many words for money. There's cash, credit, debit, funds, capital, rent, currency, income, expense, wage, interest, bonds, shares, securities, investment, commodities, remittance, annuities, subsidy, alimony, revenue, options, assets, profit and loss, pension, bonus, discount, rebate, ransom, bribe, and even those awful words like charity and donation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'n besides the words for money itself, there are words such as banker, accountant, cheapskate, and miser.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;And investor, and venture capitalist, which are what I am.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I get it. Money is important.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Did you know the innovation of writing, so long ago, was first used for banking and accounting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Banks protected traders from thieves and pirates because their money was kept in banks not in pockets and bags anymore.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, pirates. That was a profession then.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Now money is transferred through the internet.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the modern version of pirates is lawyers?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Oh no, today's lawyers are like ancient scribes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how do you choose to invest the money you've got, to get more?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;I only invest in high-profit deals.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why not invest in businesses that offer value?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;The high-profit one has to compensate for the other nine deals that flop.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you're really looking for just the one big one you can brag about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Ah, yes, the unicorn. The one that swells my pockets so much more. I don't want to miss out on those. Yes, one unicorn in the forest is worth more than five zebras in the brush.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Zebras?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Those are the small businesses that grow slow by making and selling something that consumers readily want. They don't need our venture capital for the big marketing blitzes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Isn't the basis of earning income to sell what customers want?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Sure money can be used to overcome customer dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What I mean is ideally I'd like to find funding for a business idea. I've invented a tool for cleaning leaf gutters, without getting on a ladder. Would you invest in a business that sells such a wonderful tool like that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;That seems like small potatoes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Lots of people get injured on a ladder while cleaning gutters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;That's a great spin! Fear of falling. That's a fear that would sell lots of product. So do you have a patent?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I can't afford that cost. That's like thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Many tens of thousands of clams.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I couldn't afford even a few hundred dollars to ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Then why would I be interested? I only invest when there is a barrier against competition. There has to be something like a monopoly or a virtual monopoly to ensure my investment is not wasted, not lost.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So a working prototype isn't enough?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Nope. We also need proof of good income. For that you need customers and testimonials and most of all, profit in the bank.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If income I already had, I could self-fund it. And with that I could go to a bank and ask for a loan.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Banks don't lend for things like that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If I were to buy a house they'd loan for that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;A mortgage, hah, it doesn't work like that. Instead the bank buys the house and makes you pay money down so that if you should default after just a few months, they could sell the house and still make a nice profit.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So really banks don't loan money?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;They still do a bit, sometimes. Mostly now they are gamblers. They make money by buying and selling, ah, another word for money, derivatives. Big things, not small things.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What are derivatives?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Those are contracts on paper, or the digital equivalent, written by lawyers. Lots of times they are promises to pay money if something happens, like if interest rates rise or fall.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That sounds a lot like gambling.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;It is. And gambling, that's what we venture capitalists do too. We loan money. It's like those ancient sea voyages. Someone had to buy the ship and pay sailors before they could even set sail. Then, on return, if they returned, the cargo was sold, and the backer got his share of the profits.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the captain and crew got what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;They got for them what was lots of money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But the backer got more?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Of course, 'cause he took the biggest risk.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Those times sound barbaric.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;They were. In those ancient times fighting was done by soldiers, and hard labor was done by workers. Now fighting is so much safer. It's done by lawyers. Whoever pays the most wins in court 'n gets the most.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I see how money works. So how can I switch from being an employee and become an employer? Owning a small business that's my dream. Some success, financially, so that I can buy a home, own a car, and maybe sometimes travel by air to places far. Not a yacht, a cabin no, I just want fair rewards for my hard work. How do I make that switch?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Leverage is the key. You need a vision. And you must find workers who in you they trust. You work them hard. You hire lawyers to sue any competitors. And of course you hire marketing folks who promote your vision so that consumers trust your brand.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So I should start a cult?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;If it makes money, I'd invest.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It sounds as if making money is about lying and cheating.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;It's not lying. That's not cheating. It's marketing and stepping on toes. In fact anything goes. But not lying and cheating 'cause that lands you in the slammer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;To get ahead financially I have to step on people's toes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Competition. It's the very foundation of a free market.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Stepping on toes. Anything goes. That's the trick of corporations. Why are they the winners in the business world?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Ah the key is politics. We shareholders and investors give money to politicians, and then to us politicians listen. That's not cheating, it's not against any law. I share mula with any politician who passes laws that give us more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;After your money buys you a louder voice in politics, what do you get from the politicians you buy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Tax breaks and subsidies, and sometimes legal monopolies. I do love these. Getting richer, my business thrives.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But not so for others lives. The customers. The employees.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;If someone else should be beaten, that's their choice. They need to speak up with a louder voice.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Don't you fear the people who want to tax the wealthy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;They want to tax the rich like me but that's too bad for them, not me. Because you see, the businesses that I own, those are what can own a yacht and a ski lodge and other things I don't yet got. Plus businesses pay me to travel to spend a day sitting on a board of directors, sandwiched within a nice retreat to a fancy spot with a date that's hot eating rich foods. Most of it's deductible, a money word that brings me joy. A tax on the rich you see I can evade. It misses me. The tax breaks and subsidies are for the companies I own shares of. We use those tricks so sly yet legal. All because we pay off politicians.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Aren't lawyers also involved?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Ah yes lawyers who are sly, they help me too. Our lawyers use documents to fight in court.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why do lawyers always win? Against those who can't afford to hire them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Our political puppets pass the laws that our lawyer friends write. So of course the lawyers know where all the loopholes are. They wrote the laws. I do love it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is that all that money is needed for, to get those advantages?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Another part, staying rich, requires we own newspapers, and TV stations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;So when there is a scandal in a business that we own, it doesn't get reported in the news.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How about the news sources you don't own?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;The business buys advertising from those places. Have you noticed that newspapers never report scandalous stories about grocery stores? That's because grocery stores buy lots of newspaper ads.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What about a small business? It can't afford so many ads.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;My dear boy, there's no money to be made by going small. It's big businesses that earn the dough. And really big ones are chains and they can advertise across the city, across the state, across the nation. And do it more efficiently. But newspapers that cover just a neighborhood? Until recently, when NextDoor and News Here Now came along, that's not been a thing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Are there other tricks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Of course! Big corporations hire the big four accounting firms to get around laws that were co-written by those big four accounting firms.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's, er, a sweet deal for corporations. Are there yet other tricks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;The most important trick is to give political campaign contributions to political candidates who, after the election, can help pass laws that give our businesses tax break after tax break. Why do you think big businesses pay big salaries?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah yes, money in politics. I know about that. But I don't yet understand how it works. Non-rich voters greatly outnumber the wealthy, so how can money outweigh those votes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Part of the trick is that we have infiltrated both parties. That way we can control who wins the primary elections of both parties. So general elections are between a puppet Republican and a puppet Democrat.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Don't politicians notice that tactic?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;We also give a bit of money to the one we want to lose. It's like insurance. We still get access. Just in case those dang voters oppose who we want. But we give more to the one we want to win.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why don't voters notice how it works?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;That flow of money is hard to trace. Such as when rich wives register as Democrats and give family money to conservative Democratic politicians during primary elections.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;There's something else going on isn't there?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;You are bright! Yes, we pay news sources to entertain and distract. The biggest of distractions are those endless debates about issues of religion.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Religion?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Abortion is the really useful one. The Republican party squeezes that for all it's worth.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So the Republican party doesn't really care about abortion?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;We sorta care, but not as much as tax breaks and subsidies and our legal monopolies.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I have to admit voters don't see through that. They are so distracted by the fight between left and right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;They are suckers. They believe the enemy of their enemy is their friend.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Even I know that's stupid. So, how do you know which candidates to fund, and by how much?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;The consultants we hire tell us where the money should go.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And how do those consultants know which puppets, er, politicians to bribe, er, fund?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;They charge thousands of dollars to figure that out. And they don't reveal their secrets, their strategies.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Politicians know, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;I've never asked. It just works.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I must admit I like to figure things out. Is there maybe a politician you know who might be willing to explain how it works &#8212; so that I know how to earn big money your way?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;There is someone I've given lots of money to. He's retiring from Congress soon. Maybe he knows how it works.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is there something I can do for you, if you can maybe arrange that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;Indeed, you can come up with a better business plan, one that can grow, become big.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I will try. And now I know what barriers to jump over to get to my big dreams of financial success. You've taught me much. I'm grateful for that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;I'm happy to give advice to young hard-working men who share my love of money, especially if you can help me earn more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll do my best to rise to the very top. [whispers] And get to the bottom of the corruption. [normal voice] Thank you so much for taking time to share your great wisdom.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Matt:</span>&#160;You're welcome! And remember the trick.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Stepping on toes, anything goes.</p>
