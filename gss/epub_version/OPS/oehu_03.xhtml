<h1>Scene 2, Money Madness</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D (Damien):</span>&#160;'ello mister Morton.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J (Jordon):</span>&#160;Welcome to my home. 'N just call me Jordon.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Grafton, my fiance's father, said you make money dance. 'N I'd like to advance my state of finance. Could ya teach me some tricks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Shall we start with some licks? In the fridge is some mint chocolate chip ice cream. Want some?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;That's too rich a taste for me. Risin' out of serfdom. That's my dream. I wanna pass to the middle class. I long to be financially secure, as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;I applaud your taste for money. Lots of folks are fond of stuffed bears, warm and fuzzy. But a wallet that's fat, just like me, what's better than that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Without money my world feels upside down, like a turtle on it's back.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;With money, my world feels right side up. I've got a knack for acquiring riches, obscene amounts. It feels like getting payouts spilling onto the floor from a slot machine. Yet I want more. I can't afford my own jet, or a yacht. Not there yet. Don't yet got all I want.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So, what's the trick? Of gettin' money to fund a life not wrecked?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;You've got to treat other people with respect, <i>before</i> you step on their toes. Then anything goes. That's the <i>trick</i>. That's how I act like a ... an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So you put Benjamins before humans?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Think about this. The love of money is built into our language. We have zillions of words for money. There's alimony, annuities, assets, bonds, and bonus, bounty, bribe, and capital, cash, and commodities, credit, currency, debit, discount, expense, and funds, income, interest, investment, options, pension, ransom, rebate, and remittance, rent, revenue, securities, shares, subsidy, and wage, and even those awful words like charity and donation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I see. 'N besides words for mula and dough, there're words like banker, accountant, economist, miser, embezzler, 'n vulture capitalist.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;And investor, and venture capitalist, which are part of what I am.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Yeah, money's damn important.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Did you know that long ago, when writing was new, writing was used for banking and accounting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;That was before my time.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;That way money was stored in banks, not in pockets nor in bags anymore. That protected traders from pirates, thieves, and marauding desperados.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Ah, pirates. That was a profession back when swashbuckling exams were open to the poor.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Pickpockets, pirates, and highway robbers are becoming as uncommon as blue-footed boobies. Now that money travels out of sight at the speed of light.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;'N the modern version of pirates is lawyers?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Oh no, today's lawyers are like ancient scribes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So how do you choose where to put the money you've got, to get more?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Besides side-stepping traps set by gold diggers, I only invest in high-profit deals.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;How come you don't invest in businesses that offer value?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;The high-profit one has to compensate for the other eight, the ones that flop. Like Enron, the early pets dot com, and America Offline diskettes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So you're seekin' the one big standout you can brag about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Ah, yes, the unicorn. The one that swells my pockets til they burst. Missing out on one of those would be the worst. Yes, one unicorn in the forest is worth more than five zebras in the brush.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Zebras?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Those are the small businesses that march to riches slowly, by making something that consumers readily want, and selling a quality version at an affordable price. They don't need our venture capital for big marketing blitzes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Isn't the whole business scene about selling what customers want? Or crave, like nicotine, 'n chocolate milk with Cheerios?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Sure money can be used to oppose customer dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;What I mean is, well, I'd like to find fundin' for a business idea. I've invented a tool for cleanin' leaf gutters, without gettin' on a ladder. Would ya invest in a business that sells the best kind of tool for that task?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Nah, that's not much better than a cordless bungee-jumping franchise.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Lots of people get injured, fallin' off a ladder while cleanin' gutters. Some land on their head, and end up dead.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;That's a great spin! Fear of fallin'. That's a fear that would sell lots of product. Do you have a patent?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I can't afford that cost. That's like thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Many tens of thousands of clams.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I couldn't afford even a few hundred dollars to ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Why would I invest unless there's a barrier against competition? There's gotta be a monopoly, or a legal monopoly. Or some kind of virtual monopoly. That way my investment doesn't evaporate like a raindrop falling into Death Valley.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So a workin' prototype's not enough?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Nope. That's as useless as a machine-gun mount on the back of a golf cart. What the biz needs is a big amount of income, plus customers and testimonials. Then we'd invest.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;If income I already had, I could self-fund it. 'N with that I could go to a bank 'n ask for a loan.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Ha, the bank officials might nod ernestly. They might even encourage you to open an account, and get you to fill out a few forms. But when you've stepped out the door, they'll wet themselves with laughter.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;If I were to buy a house they'd loan for that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;A mortgage, hah. It doesn't work like that. Instead the bank buys the house. Your down payment's big enough to pay for a year of law school. So if soon you lose your job and miss your payments, they sell the house, and you and a couple of homeowners have paid for a banker's kid to become a lawyer. That path leads to homelessness, unless you have trustworthy income.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So banks don't loan money?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;They still do a bit, occassionally. Mostly now they're high-rolling gamblers that make casinos look like kids playing a game of Monopoly. They make big money by buying and selling, ah, another word for money, derivatives. Big things, not small things.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;What're derivatives?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Those are contracts on paper, or the cyberspace equivalent, written by lawyers. Lots of times they're promises to pay money if something happens, like if interest rates rise or fall.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;That sounds a lot like gamblin'.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;It is. And gambling, that's what we venture capitalists do too. We supply capital. It's like those ancient sea voyages. Someone had to buy the ship and pay sailors, and stock up on gruel and limes, before they could even set sail. Then, on return, if they returned, the cargo was sold, and the backer got his share of the gold.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;'N the captain 'n crew got what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;What they got was a temporary pass to the middle class. Until they got swindled, or badly beaten in a casino, <span class="highlight">or forced into bankruptcy by divorce. <span class="explain">[fix_humor]</span></span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;But the backer got more?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Of course, 'cause he took the biggest risk.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Those times sound barbaric.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;They were. In those ancient times fighting was done by soldiers. Now fighting is so much safer. It's done by lawyers fighting with legal documents instead of swords. And instead of wearing armour, or bullet-proof vests, they wear colorful neckties, or Victoria's Secret lingerie. Quite civilized nowadays.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I think I see how money works. So how can I switch from bein' an employee to become an employer? Ownin' a small business, that's my dream. Some success, financially, so I can buy a fixer-upper house, pay for ultra-fast access to, er, ..., kitten videos, 'n drive a car that didn't come off Henry Ford's production line. Not a private jet. Not even just a log cabin in the woods. Not yet. I just want fair rewards for my hard work. How do I make that leap?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;You need to dig deep, to develop a compelling vision. A lofty one that will inspire. Then you hire workers who follow your vision like ducklings behind their mom. You work them hard. You hire lawyers to sue competitors. And of course you hire marketing folks who super-size your PR blitzes. They'll make ads that are grand! So consumers will trust your brand.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So I should start a cult? 'N of course there'd be an app with that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;That might put you on the wealthy map. If you shift the idolotry to money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;It sounds like makin' money is about lyin' 'n cheatin'.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;It's not lying. That's not cheating. It's marketing and stepping on toes. In fact anything goes. But not lying and cheating. 'Cause that lands you in the slammer. That'd be a bummer 'cause your bank accounts can't protect you when you drop the shared bar of soap in the prison shower.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;To get ahead financially I have to step on people's toes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Or a gentle push to the nose. Business is all about competition. It's the very foundation of a free market.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Stomping on toes. Anything goes. That's the trick of corporations. How come they're the winners in the business world?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Ah, the key is politics. We shareholders and investors give money to politicians. Then to us they listen. That's not cheating. It's not against any law. I share mula with any politician who passes laws that dump big amounts of golden coins into my bank accounts.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;After your money buys you a louder voice, in politics, what do ya get from the politicians you buy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Tax breaks and subsidies. And sometimes legal monopolies. Oh I do love these. With these breaks, my business thrives.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;But not so for others' lives. The customers. The employees.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;If someone else gets beaten, that's their choice. They need to speak up with a louder voice.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Don't you fear the folks who want to tax the wealthy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;The business that I closely own, with more profit it could buy a beach house, or ski lodge, or yacht. Something I don't yet got. My biz buddies and I would share it. Or rent it to me for almost free. That tactic evades hefty income tax rates. So an extra tax on the rich, it misses me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So the key is ownin' a biz?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Or getting on the board of directors. Three businesses pay me to travel to their board meetings. There we vote to reduce labor costs. Then, using big profits from the previous year's decision, we vote for huge bonuses for ourselves. That's sandwiched within a resort vacation. At a fancy spot where I lounge for days with a date who's hot. Or at least I rent a Beemer convertible and indulge in rich meals with someone like flirty Felicity Dimwittle. Plus I do some side deals. And most of it's deductible, a money word that brings me joy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So the tax breaks and subsidies are for companies. The ones you own, or own shares of?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Yup. The paperwork's a hassle, but those sly tricks are legal. All because we pay off politicians.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Don't lawyers also assist?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Yes our lawyers fight battles in court. They exterminate our enemies. But nowadays no blood is shed. The loser only suffers financially.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;It seems the lawyers at the top of the legal food chain always win. Why's that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;They write the bills that get passed into law. So of course they know where the loopholes are. It's all a big family. I do love it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;When you get tax breaks, or legal monopolies, how big are they?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Usually at least three dollars. Often twenty. Sometimes, oh the really really good ones, they're more than a hundred.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Is that all? Only about twenty dollars? After donating hundreds or even thousands of dollars?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Three or twenty or a hundred dollars is per dollar spent.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;You mean ... for each dollar you contribute .... You mean, let's say you give fifty thousand dollars. Your business can get a million dollars in extra profits because of the tax breaks, subsidies, or legal monopolies?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Yup! It's a great ROI. That's return on investment.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Wow! Amazing! That's better than ownin' a Las Vegas slot machine!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Another trick is to own newspapers and TV stations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Those make out like bandits?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;It's not for their meager profits. That's so when there's dirty linen in a biz we own it doesn't become known.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;How about news sources you don't own?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;The business buys advertising spaces from those places. Have you noticed that scandalous stories about grocery stores never appear in newspapers? That's because grocery stores pay for lots of newspaper ads.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;That protection racket's not what a small store can afford to play.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;My dear boy, there's no money to be made by aiming low. It's big businesses that earn the dough. The really big ones are chains that use mass media to broadcast their ads across a big city, or even a state.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I know someone who wants to start a restaurant. Can't he buy ads for just a neighborhood?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Only costly printed ads cover small neighborhoods. Well, 'til recently, when NextDoor and News Here Now came along.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Are there yet other tricks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Doing tricks keeps a corporation as busy as an escort in Las Vegas during convention season. Another trick is big corporations hire the big four accounting firms to get around laws that were co-written by those big four accounting firms.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;That's, er, a sweet deal. For the corporations. But thinkin' of me, what's the best kind of biz to be? I wanna become an entrepreneur. What's the best strategy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;To become a big cheeze, put the squeeze on customers. Become the bottleneck between supply and demand.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So you mean extortion's the best kind of plan?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;To see what I mean, consider the music industry. The way it was years ago, before a recording studio got squeezed into a home computer or smartphone. Back then, cutting a record, literally, meant using very expensive equipment to transform sound waves into vibrations that cut grooves on a master disk. That equipment was so rare that musicians would work for cheap.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Or trade sex for a record deal?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Sometimes that was a perk. But times have changed. Now a microphone and an iPad plus some apps can do it all. From making an album to selling it online. So that pinch point, that bottleneck, is gone. And with it went lots of profit. Now, music-industry lawyers hold their grip by threatening to sue any pub, tavern, bar, or restaurant that doesn't buy a license to play the copyrighted music those lawyers control.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Ah, that's why we can't sing the Beatles song <i>Let It Be</i> in public. Now I see. Record labels lost their bottleneck. The electronic technology they used to monopolize now fits inside a tablet app. Aren't newspapers losing their grip too?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;And movie producers. And book publishers. And radio and TV stations. They lost their monopolies. Now those industries are like airplanes dropping from the sky in a tailspin. So the trick is to find a new bottleneck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Doesn't a patent provide a bottleneck?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;In theory, yeah. But really, a patent bottleneck only works for a big big invention.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So inventing's a dead end?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;If you could find a genius who could keep your business innovative and out in front of competitors, that'd be sweet. Very profitable. But a creative genius is rare and doesn't work for cheap. And when you post a job opening like that, the job applicants are pompus artists, unemployed writers, and <span class="highlight">people like loony Luna Tickwit from Tulsa. <span class="explain">[OK as is? fix_humor]</span></span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So the idea behind a monopoly is to block competitors?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;That's the key. A technology monopoly or a legal monopoly are two of the best.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;From what you said, a business you'd invest in must be legal. So why have you been sayin' legal monopoly? Instead of just monopoly?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Legal monopoly refers to a monopoly that's created by a law.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;An example would give me a clue 'bout what you're referrin' to.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;There are laws that protect drug companies from the herbal industry.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Drugs are illegal. But drug companies are legal?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Not those drugs. The legal kind. Pharmaceuticals. They avoid competition from herb sellers because laws outlaw health claims for substances that don't have negative side effects.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Does that mean food also can't claim health benefits?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;I admire your mental agility. But don't get too cheeky. In addition to that partial legal monopoly, pharmaceutical companies get huge tax deductions because drug testing qualifies as research.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Those are slick tricks. Especially gettin' a law that creates a monopoly, 'cause it's automatically legal. Are there other tricks? For getting big profits?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;As many as an eagle has feathers. Another is slowing down product innovations. If a product takes too big of a leap, we miss out on consumers paying for each slight improvement.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;What's the most important trick?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;That has to be giving campaign contributions to political candidates. After they get re-elected they protect the laws that give our business tax break after tax break. And if we're lucky, they create a new legal monopoly, or taxpayer-funded subsidy. That's why big businesses pay six-figure salaries so freely.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Ah yes, money in politics. I know 'bout that. But I don't yet understand how it works. Non-rich voters greatly outnumber the wealthy, so how can dinero outweigh those votes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;We've infiltrated both parties. This is how we control who wins the primary elections of both parties. So general elections are between a puppet Republican and a puppet Democrat.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Yeah, puppets win. I knew that part. But I hadn't noticed the infiltration tactic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Republican voters assume Democrats are dimwits, and Democratic voters assume Republicans are dimwits. In the primary, the winner's always from the correct party, so the money bias goes unchallenged. In the general election it's too late. For added insurance in a tight race we might give a bit of money to the one we hate. But we give far more to the one we choose. That way we can't lose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;How come news reporters don't expose how it works?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;That flow of money is harder to follow than a mouse running through a cornfield. Such as when rich wives register as Democrats and give family money to conservative Democratic politicians during primary elections.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;There's somethin' else going on isn't there?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;You are bright! Yes, we pay news sources to entertain and distract. The biggest of distractions are those endless debates about issues of religion.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Religion?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Abortion is the really useful one. The Republican party squeezes that for all it's worth.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;So the Republican party doesn't really care 'bout abortion?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;We sorta care, but not as much as tax breaks and subsidies and our legal monopolies.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I have to admit voters don't see through that. They're so distracted by the fight between left 'n right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;They are suckers. They believe the enemy of their enemy is their friend.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Even I know that's stupid. So, how do ya know which candidates to fund, 'n by how much?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;The consultants we hire tell us where the money should go.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;'N how do those consultants know which puppets, er, politicians to bribe, er, fund?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;They monopolize their secrets, their strategies. They're like astrologers and alchemists from long ago. Back before science tanked the profits from selling horoscopes, farmer's almanacs, and <span class="highlight">Professor Puffinutt's wake-up-in-the-morning-and-it's-gone magic healing elixer. <span class="explain">[fix_humor]</span></span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Politicians know, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;I've never asked. It just works. If it aint broke, there's no need to fix its quirks, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I'm curious 'bout how it works.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Curiosity killed the cat.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Satisfaction brought her back, carryin' a rat. Perhaps there's a rat, er, a politician ya know who might be willin' to explain how it works? So I can earn more money your way? To buy things for my fianc&#233;.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;I personally know a recipient of lots of my dough. He recently retired from Congress. Maybe he can give you a peek.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;That would be sweet! Is there somethin' I can do for you, if you can maybe arrange that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Indeed you can. Come up with a better business plan. A unicorn I can brag about.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I'll try! No doubt about that. I'll use what you've taught. Now I know how to jump over legal hurdles and <span class="highlight">people moving like turtles. <span class="explain">[check_humor]</span></span> I'm grateful to learn your process so I can get to my big dreams of financial success.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;I'm happy to give you advice. Especially if you can help me reach higher levels of paradise.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I'll do my best to rise to the very top. <span class="explain">[Whispers.]</span> 'N get to the bottom of the corruption. <span class="explain">[Normal voice.]</span> Thank you so much for taking time to share your wisdom.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;You're welcome! And remember the trick.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Act like a ... person showing respect, then step on toes, anything goes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_vc">J:</span>&#160;Splendid! I look forward to you making my wallet even fatter, so there's an even bigger bulge in my pants. In fact I'll indulge in some ice cream right now to celebrate in advance.</p>
