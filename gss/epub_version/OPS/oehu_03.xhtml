<h1>Scene 2, Money Madness</h1>
************ <p class="action">Action: Damien enters, Jordon does not get out of chair.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'ello mister Morton. Grafton, my fiance's father, said you make money dance. And I'd like to advance my state of finance. Could you teach me some tricks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Shall we start with some licks? In the fridge is some mint chocolate chip ice cream. Want some?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's too rich a taste for me. Rising out of serfdom, that's my dream. I want a pass to the middle class. I long to be financially secure as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Some folks like what's warm and fuzzy. A plush stuffed bear? Nah, I prefer money. A wallet that's fat, just like me, what's better than that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Without money my world feels upside down, like a turtle on it's back.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;With money, my world feels right side up, like getting a top gaming score. Yet I want more. I can't afford my own jet, or a yacht, not there yet. Don't yet got all I want.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what's the trick? Of getting money to fund a life not wrecked.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;You've got to treat other people with respect, before you step on their toes. Then anything goes. That's the trick. That's how I get ever richer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you put Benjamins before people?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Think about this. The love of money is built into our language. We have so many words for money. There's alimony, annuities, assets, bonds, and bonus, bounty, bribe, and capital, cash, and commodities, credit, currency, debit, discount, expense, and funds, income, interest, investment, options, pension, ransom, rebate, and remittance, rent, revenue, securities, shares, subsidy, and wage, and even those awful words like charity and donation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'n besides words for mula and dough, there're words like banker, accountant, miser, and vulture capitalist.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;And investor, and venture capitalist, which are what I am.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, money's damn important.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Did you know that long ago, the innovation of writing was first begun for use in banking and accounting?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Banks used writing for accounting so money was stored in banks, not in pockets nor in bags anymore. That protected unarmed traders from pirates, thieves, and marauding desperados.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, pirates. That was a profession back when swashbuckling exams were open to the poor.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Pickpockets, pirates, and highway robbers have gone extinct now that money travels out of sight at the speed of light.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the modern version of pirates is lawyers?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Oh no, today's lawyers are like ancient scribes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how do you choose where to put the money you've got, to get more?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Besides avoiding gold diggers, I only invest in high-profit deals.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why not invest in businesses that offer value?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;The high-profit one has to compensate for the other eight, the deals that flop, like pets dot com, may it rest in peace.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you're seeking the one big standout you can brag about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Ah, yes, the unicorn. The one that swells my pockets til they burst. Missing out on one of those would be the worst. Yes, one unicorn in the forest is worth more than five zebras in the brush.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Zebras?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Those are the small businesses that grow slow, by making and selling something of quality that consumers readily want. They don't need our venture capital for big marketing blitzes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Isn't the whole business scene about selling what customers want? Or crave, like caffeine, nicotine, and Beanie Babies.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Sure money can be used to undercut obstinate customer dissatisfaction.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What I mean is ideally I'd like to find funding for a business idea. I've invented a tool for cleaning leaf gutters, without getting on a ladder. Would you invest in a business that sells the best kind of tool for that task?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Nah, those seem like small tomatoes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Lots of people get injured, falling off a ladder while cleaning gutters. Some land on their head, and end up dead.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;That's a great spin! Fear of falling. That's a fear that would sell lots of product. Do you have a patent?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I can't afford that cost. That's like thousands of dollars.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Many tens of thousands of clams.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I couldn't afford even a few hundred dollars to ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Then why would I be interested? I only invest when there's a barrier against competition. There has to be something like a monopoly or a virtual monopoly to ensure my investment is not wasted, not lost.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So a working prototype isn't enough?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Nope. That's as useless as a machine-gun mount on the back of a golf cart. What the biz needs is a big amount of income, plus customers and testimonials. Then we'd invest.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If income I already had, I could self-fund it. And with that I could go to a bank and ask for a loan.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Ha, the bank officials would nod ernestly and encourage you to fill out forms, then when you've stepped out the door, they'll wet themselves with laughter.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If I were to buy a house they'd loan for that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;A mortgage, hah, it doesn't work like that. Instead the bank buys the house and makes you pay money down so that if you should default after just a few months, they could sell the house and still make a nice profit.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So really banks don't loan money?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;They still do a bit, sometimes. Mostly now they're high-rolling gamblers who make casinos look like kids playing a game of Monopoly. They make money by buying and selling, ah, another word for money, derivatives. Big things, not small things.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What are derivatives?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Those are contracts on paper, or the digital equivalent, written by lawyers. Lots of times they are promises to pay money if something happens, like if interest rates rise or fall.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That sounds a lot like gambling.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;It is. And gambling, that's what we venture capitalists do too. We loan money. It's like those ancient sea voyages. Someone had to buy the ship and pay sailors before they could even set sail. Then, on return, if they returned, the cargo was sold, and the backer got his share of the profits.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the captain and crew got what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;What they got was a temporary pass to the middle class. Until they got robbed, or stone drunk, or swindled.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But the backer got more?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Of course, 'cause he took the biggest risk.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Those times sound barbaric.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;They were. In those ancient times fighting was done by soldiers, and hard labor was done by workers. Now fighting is so much safer. It's done by lawyers fighting with legal documents instead of swords, and wearing suits instead of armour or bullet-proof vests. Whoever pays the most wins in court 'n gets the most. Quite civilized nowadays.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think I see how money works. So how can I switch from being an employee and become an employer? Owning a small business, that's my dream. Some success, financially, so I can buy a fixer-upper house, sometimes visit relatives who live afar, and drive a car that didn't come off Henry Ford's production line. Not a yacht, a cabin no, I just want fair rewards for my hard work. How do I take that leap?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Leverage is the key. You need a vision. And you must find workers who in you they trust. You work them hard. You hire lawyers to sue any competitors. And of course you hire marketing folks who promote your vision so that consumers trust your brand.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So I should start a cult? 'N of course there would be an app.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;That might work. If you shift the idolotry to money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It sounds like making money is about lying and cheating.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;It's not lying. That's not cheating. It's marketing and stepping on toes. In fact anything goes. But not lying and cheating 'cause that lands you in the slammer, where your money can't even buy a hammer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;To get ahead financially I have to step on people's toes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Or a gentle push to the nose. Business is all about competition. It's the very foundation of a free market.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Stomping on toes. Anything goes. That's the trick of corporations. Why are they the winners in the business world?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Ah the key is politics. We shareholders and investors give money to politicians. Then to us they listen. That's not cheating, it's not against any law. I share mula with any politician who passes laws that give us more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;After your money buys you a louder voice in politics, what do you get from the politicians you buy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Tax breaks and subsidies, and sometimes legal monopolies. I do love these. Getting richer, my business thrives.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But not so for others lives. The customers. The employees.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;If someone else gets beaten, that's their choice. They need to speak up with a louder voice.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Don't you fear the people who want to tax the wealthy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;They want to tax the rich like me but that's too bad for them, not me. Because you see, the businesses that I partly own, those are what can own a yacht, and a ski lodge, and other things I don't yet got. Three businesses pay me to travel to their board meetings. That's sandwiched within a resort vacation, at a fancy spot where I lounge for days with a date who's hot. Or at least I can indulge in rich meals with a flirty companion. Plus I do some side deals. And most of it's deductible, a money word that brings me joy. A tax on the rich you see I can evade. It misses me. The tax breaks and subsidies are for the companies I own shares of. We use those tricks so sly yet legal. All because we pay off politicians.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Don't lawyers also assist?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Yes our lawyers fight battles in court. They exterminate our enemies. But nowadays no blood is shed. The loser only suffers financially.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It seems the lawyers with the highest fees always win. Why's that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Lawyers at the top write the bills that get passed into law. So of course they know where the loopholes are. It's all a big family. I do love it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is that all that money's needed for, to get those competitive edges?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Another component of commerce is to stay rich. A trick for that is to own newspapers, and TV stations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;So when there's a scandal in a business we own, it doesn't become known.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How about news sources you don't own?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;The business buys advertising spaces from those places. Have you noticed that newspapers never report scandalous stories about grocery stores? That's because grocery stores buy lots of newspaper ads.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That protection racket's not what a small store can afford to play.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;My dear boy, there's no money to be made by aiming low. It's big businesses that earn the dough. The really big ones are chains that use mass media to broadcast their ads across a big city, or even a state.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I know someone who wants to start a restaurant. Can't he buy ads for just a neighborhood?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Only costly printed ads cover such small areas. Well, 'til recently, when NextDoor and News Here Now came along.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Are there other tricks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Doing tricks keeps a corporation as busy as an escort in Las Vegas during convention season. Another trick is big corporations hire the big four accounting firms to get around laws that were co-written by those big four accounting firms.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's, er, a sweet deal for corporations. Are there yet other tricks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;As many as an eagle has feathers. The most important trick is to give political campaign contributions to political candidates who, after the election, pass laws that give our businesses tax break after tax break. That's why big businesses can afford to pay big salaries.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah yes, money in politics. I know about that. But I don't yet understand how it works. Non-rich voters greatly outnumber the wealthy, so how can money outweigh those votes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Part of the trick is that we have infiltrated both parties. In this way we control who wins the primary elections of both parties. So general elections are between a puppet Republican and a puppet Democrat.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, puppets win. I knew that part. But I hadn't noticed that tactic.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Republican voters assume Democrats are fools, and Democratic voters assume Republicans are fools. In the primary, the winner's always from the correct party, so it goes unnoticed. Especially because in the general election it's too late. And for insurance we might give a bit of money to the one we want to lose. But we give more to the one we want to win. That way we can't lose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why don't voters notice how it works?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;That flow of money is harder to follow than a mouse running through a cornfield. Such as when rich wives register as Democrats and give family money to conservative Democratic politicians during primary elections.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;There's something else going on isn't there?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;You are bright! Yes, we pay news sources to entertain and distract. The biggest of distractions are those endless debates about issues of religion.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Religion?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Abortion is the really useful one. The Republican party squeezes that for all it's worth.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So the Republican party doesn't really care about abortion?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;We sorta care, but not as much as tax breaks and subsidies and our legal monopolies.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I have to admit voters don't see through that. They are so distracted by the fight between left and right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;They are suckers. They believe the enemy of their enemy is their friend.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Even I know that's stupid. So, how do you know which candidates to fund, and by how much?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;The consultants we hire tell us where the money should go.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And how do those consultants know which puppets, er, politicians to bribe, er, fund?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;They charge thousands of dollars to figure that out. And they don't reveal their secrets, their strategies. They perform magic like astrologers and alchemists did long ago.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Politicians know, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;I've never asked. It just works. If it aint broke, there's no need to fix it, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I must admit I like to figure things out. Is there maybe a politician you know who might be willing to explain how it works &#8212; so I know how to earn big money your way?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;There's someone I've given lots of money to. He recently retired from Congress. Maybe he knows how it works.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is there something I can do for you, if you can maybe arrange that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;Indeed, you can come up with a better business plan, one that can grow, become big.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll try. And now I know what barriers to jump over to get to my big dreams of financial success. You've taught me much. I confess I'm grateful to learn your process.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;I'm happy to give advice to young hard-working men who share my love of money, especially if you can help me earn more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll do my best to rise to the very top. [whispers] And get to the bottom of the corruption. [normal voice] Thank you so much for taking time to share your wisdom.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Jordon:</span>&#160;You're welcome! And remember the trick.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Starting with respect, then stepping on toes, anything goes.</p>
