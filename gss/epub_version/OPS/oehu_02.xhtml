<h1>Scene 1, Our Middle Class Dreams</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Damien! Are you thinking of jumping off?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wi' today's luck I'd land on somethin' soft.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Like a fresh load of horse manure? Or a truck full of marshmallows?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Or my head.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;That would put a dent ... in paying next month's rent. What's the matter?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah'm feelin' sadder than a limpin' seagull in winter in Seattle.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;How'd you get there? Why so abysmal?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Life's so unfair. M' dream's been shattered.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Which dream's been fractured? The picket fence around a front yard that's big enough for a Saint Bernard?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Tha's your dream. M'n was to enter th' middle class.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, to gain that entrance you've been bustin' your ass.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;M' butt's busted. Wha' more does it take?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Maybe a secret handshake? What's up?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;T'day my boss popped my bubble.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Is his business in trouble?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Nah, bu' he told me some stuff, 'bout some laws that're rough.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The ones corporations can avoid?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, it's got me annoyed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Some corporations are sneakier than pickpockets, drug dealers, and kids giving away free kittens.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Us taxpayers get pushed t' the edge. Don't they see? We're lookin' down into a volcano of molten lava called bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;You didn't tell me we're close to the edge. How can this be?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'Ow is't we who vote aren't th' ones keepin' afloat? W're supposed t' have d'mocracy!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes we can vote, but most candidates are wimpy puppets, or slimey con artists.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'R third-party spoilers. I hate tha' sulfurous stink when I hav'ta mark th' lesser fink.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah it's a big kink in democracy. Laws always favor the wealthy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We make a big fuss, yet th' rich outvote us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yet they're fewer in number than rabbits near a den of coyotes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is th' only prognosis hopelessness?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Maybe it's hypnosis? Or the political ads I suppose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We c'n see through those. Somethin's hidden. There's gotta be another villian.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;A conspiracy? A dark-money tyranny? Or a Bermuda pentagon with two sides missing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I dunno. Bu' as my dad would say, <i>Get to the root of the problem, that's where the solution lay.</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;My parents, they taught me, <i>Suit up, show up, pay attention, and then pretend to work work work</i>.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Willin' to bust my ass, that I'm willin' t' do. Bu' not if we're followin' th' footsteps of Native Americans.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;What footsteps?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;They spoke <i>White chiefs are like wolves who herd us like buffalo. From our grazing lands onto dry deserts where foods don't grow. Those two-faced wolves feed their greed beyond their need.</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;We're bein' herded indeed. Something's not right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Damn I wanna know whose hand I should bite!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Financially, our life's so far upside down from where I want it to be.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wanna be an employer, but I'm just an employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I wanna be a princess. But do you see a tiara on my empty head?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, we're upside down. Money's drainin' from our pockets like chips from a novice at a Los Vegas craps table.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;My dental smile gives us cheer, but now when dining out we can't afford beer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;When dinner's got veggies 'n meat, our car's gas gauge says stay off th' street.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Do you want a chocolate truffle?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Somethin' brown t' get me down, no thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;They're delicious.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm suspicious. Something's goin' on behind our backs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes, right in front of our eyes. The trickle-down economy works for corporations, but not for us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Work 'n cash should come as a pair, but one without th' other, that's not effin' fair!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, we're indentured to jerks and getting only <span class="highlight">pea-sized</span> perks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Th' boss I've got's almost a saint. Bu' now he says he's drownin'. There's taxes 'n licenses, 'n insurance, 'n extra fees. Jus' keepin' track of these adds another employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;That leaves less money for me. Your paycheck's like a balloon with a leak.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Times are bleak. I know how to invent but that don't pay the rent. Not yet. N' it won't if I'm not victorious owning my own business.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I've read that suicide is done by guys who can't find anyone else to blame. So who do you think's rigged th' political game?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I dunno. Politics's so complex.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, everything interconnects.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yet surely somewhere, maybe sittin' in a yoga pose on a high mountaintop, or kneelin' at an altar in a gothic cathedral, or standin' behind a counter asking <i>Do you want cheezy garlic bread with your pasta?</i>, there's just gotta be a geek, or geekette, who knows the secret.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Even Google can't find that <span class="highlight">needle in th' cyberweb haystack.</span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'Specially 'cause most online search has kickback associations with big corporations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Let's just say you found a guru who knew. What'd be your query, specifically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How can we get better democracy? Wait, not that. I'd ask <i>What's at the root of unfairness in politics and business?</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Bright professors teach at our city's college. In political science they teach about the electrical college, and German dating, er, gerrymandation, and such.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'd rather walk into a rattlesnake cage than turn another textbook page. Those pages shake my eyes faster than th' snake's tail. My brain throbs as weaselly words try t' drag me through names 'n dates, <span class="highlight">'n definitions. Plus facts I'll never use.</span> 'N tests, those effin' devils, just rat out those of us who didn't read th' textbook.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Now that's a real conspiracy. Textbooks and tests are in bed together, making baby test questions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Jus' bein' inside a classroom feels like I've stepped into a boxing ring wearing not boxing gloves but holding pom poms.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Ah yes, community college classes already knocked you out for the count.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;D'z it matter? History's just fat with notes from the past that's gone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Just like an Elvis museum.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;M' math teacher said a monkey with a bad resume could have done better on his tests. N' fractions, those were created by the devil when he was in a snit!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, I admit, I struggled a bit in the academic jungle. I tip-toed, and side-stepped, and a few times I tripped.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Anyway, political scientists, do they really understand why politics's so perverted, so inverted? Surely, if they knew, then Congress would better the economy, and we wouldn't be stuck in this financial muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I suppose you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Who should I fight? Where's that thing, the tilting place?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The tipping point?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, how can we, the majority, get to where we can outvote the endless dollars of one percenters?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;From a distance father knows some jet setters. I'll ask him for assistance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I know I'm not the sharpest banana in the fruit basket. Bu' if there should be a really sharp banana who can tell me, without pointing to some heavy book, why the world's so upside down, then I'll stuggle to learn, and then turn things right side up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;And when you find out who's to blame for corruption in the governmental game, what comes next?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Then I'll shift from workin' hard for th' masters we serve t' earning th' money we deserve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;If you don't get out of your slump, are you gonna jump?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I won't jump. I'm not a chump. 'T might take awhile, but I'll jump back on the crocodile and keep on ridin'. 'Cause I'm dyin'. T' know why things are upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;As long as you're not dyin' on me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;S'm people say this is just th' way it will always be. Bu' it's not OK. It's not fair! Seats 'n Congress should go to the wise. Yet sitting there now are selfish liars. We wanna elect problem-solving leaders, bu' what d' we get? Egotistic special-interest puppets whose masters treat us like light bulbs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, screwed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wanna change th' world n' turn it right side up!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The impossible. That's part of why I love you so. You want things to to be fair. You really care! But you'll need lots and lots of luck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yet with it I hope t' discover a way outta this muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Then finally we can reach prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'N suffer less adversity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I'll ask father for assistance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'N I, the dunce, will use my soft brain. As a shovel to dig down deep into elephant and donkey shit! M' sanity depends on it.</p>
