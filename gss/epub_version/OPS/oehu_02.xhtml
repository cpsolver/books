<h1>Scene 1, Our Middle Class Dreams</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Damien! Are you thinking of jumping off?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;With today's luck I'd land on something soft.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Like a truckload of pumpkins? Or a cart of dung?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Or my head.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;That would put a dent in paying next month's rent. What's the matter?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm (slurred first word) feelin' sadder than a dolphin with no fin.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Named Adolf? Why so abysmal?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Life's so unfair. My dream's been shattered.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Which dream's been fractured? The picket fence around a front yard that's big enough for a Saint Bernard?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's your dream. Mine was to enter the middle class.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, to gain that entrance you've been bustin' your ass.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My butt is busted. What more does it take?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Maybe a secret handshake?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Today my boss popped my bubble.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Is his business in trouble?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Nah, but he told me some stuff, about some laws that are rough.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The ones corporations can avoid?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, that's got me annoyed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Some corporations are more corrupt than those long-ago traveling medicine shows.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And us taxpayers get pushed to the edge. We're looking down into a volcano of molten lava called bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;You didn't tell me we're close to the edge. How can this be?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How is it that we who vote aren't the ones keepin' afloat? We're supposed to have democracy!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes we can vote, but most candidates are wimpy puppets, or con artists, or can't-win third-party whiners.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Marking the ballot oval for any such fink fills m' nose with a sulferous stink.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah it's a big kink in democracy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How can this be?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;It does seem crazy. Laws always favor the wealthy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But they're fewer in number than rabbits behind the path of a coyote pack.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;While so many of us make a big fuss.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How is it the rich outvote us? Is the only prognosis hopelessness?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Maybe it's hypnosis? Or the political ads I suppose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We can see through those. Something's hidden. There's got to be another villian.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;A conspiracy? A dark-money tyranny? Or a Bermuda pentagon with two sides missing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I dunno. But as my dad would say, "Get to the root of the problem, that's where the solution lay."</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;My parents, they taught me, suit up, show up, pay attention, and then pretend to work work work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Willing to bust my ass, that I'm willin' to do. But not if we're following the footsteps of Native Americans.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Footsteps?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;They said "The white man are like wolves who herd us like buffalo from our grazing lands onto deserts. They steal our lands to fuel their greed beyond their need."</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;We're being herded indeed. Something's not right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Damn I want to know whose hand I should bite!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Financially, our life is so far upside down from where I want it to be.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wanna be an employer, but I'm just an employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I wanna be a princess. But do you see a tiara on my empty head?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We're upside down. It's not our nose that should run. Our feet should run.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;It's not our feet that should smell. Our nose should smell.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We're upside down. Our finances are in the red, not black.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;If our teeth's appearance gives us cheer, at dinner out we can't afford beer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If our dinner's got veggies and meat, our car's gas gauge says stay off the street.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Do you want a chocolate truffle?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Something brown to get me down, no thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;They're delicious.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm suspicious. Something's going on behind our backs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes, right in front of our eyes. The trickle-down economy works for corporations, but not for us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Work and cash should come as a pair, but one without the other, that's not effing fair!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, we're stuck working for jerks doing work that sucks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;The boss I've got's almost a saint. But now he says he's drownin'. There's taxes and licenses, and insurance, and extra fees. Just keepin' track of these adds another employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;That leaves less money for us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I know how to invent but that don't pay the rent. Not yet. And it won't if I can't figure out how to own my own business.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I've read that suicide is done by men who can't find anyone else to blame. So who is rigging the political game?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I don't know. Politics's so complex.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, everything interconnects.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yet surely somewhere, maybe in an old cathedral, or on a high mountaintop, or in a dive bar, someone really smart knows the secret.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Even Google can't find that needle in the global haystack.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'Specially 'cause online networks kick us back to the money-backed asswipes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, the evil ones who rip us off, leaving less take-home pay. Let's just say you found a guru who knew. What would you ask, specifically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How can we get real democracy? Wait, not that. I'd ask "What's at the root of unfairness in politics and business?"</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Bright professors teach at our city's college. In political science they teach about the Constitution, and electrical college, and German dating, er, gerrymandation, and such.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'd rather walk into a rattlesnake cage than open another textbook. They shake my eyes faster than the snake's tail. My brain throbs as weaselly words try to drag me through names and dates, and definitions, and facts I'll never use. And tests, those effing devils, just rat out those of us who didn't read the textbook.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Now that's a real conspiracy. Textbooks and tests are in bed together.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Just being inside a classroom feels like I've stepped into a boxing ring wearing not boxing gloves but holding pom poms.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Ah yes, community college classes already knocked you out for the count.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Does it matter? History's just about the past that's gone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Just like Elvis. I admit I don't remember much.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My math teacher said a monkey with a bad resume could have done better on his tests. And fractions, those were created by the devil!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Alas you have to deal with evil fractions every day at work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I cry inside when I get a measurement like thirteen and five sixteenths inches.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I wouldn't know what to do with that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why should I struggle in the academic jungle?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I don't recall much at all from classes I took.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Anyway, do political scientists understand why politics's so upside down? With rich on top n' us voters mucking around in a financial swamp.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I suppose you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Who should I fight? Where's the tipping point? How can we, the majority, outvote the slush funds of one percenters?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I'll ask father. He might know someone who knows those secrets.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I know I'm not the sharpest banana in the fruit basket. But if there should be a really sharp banana who can tell me, without pointing to some heavy book, why the world's so upside down, then I'll stuggle to learn those secrets.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;And when you find out who's to blame for corruption in government, what comes next?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Then I'll know how to earn the money we deserve. For working so hard for the masters we serve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;If you don't figure this out, are you going to jump?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I won't jump. I'm not a chump. When the going gets tough, I'll jump back on the crocodile and keep on ridin'. 'Cause I'm dyin'. To know why things are upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;As long as you're not dyin' on me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Some people say this is just the way it will always be. But that's not OK for me. It's not fair! Getting ahead. Rising to the top. Why does it seem to happen just for jerks and windbags?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes, us hard workers deserve some perks too, don't we?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Seats in Congress should go to the wise.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yet the winners are selfish liars.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We want problem-solving leaders. What d' we get?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Special-interest puppets.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What d' the puppet-masters get?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Even richer!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the rest of us get what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Treated like a light bulb. Screwed!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wanna change the world and turn it right side up!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The impossible. That's part of why I love you so. You want things to to be fair. You really care! But you'll need lots and lots of luck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yet with it I hope to discover a way out of this muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Then finally we can reach prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And suffer less adversity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I'll ask father for some help.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll use my soft brain as a shovel to dig deep into the elephant and donkey dung! My sanity depends on it.</p>
