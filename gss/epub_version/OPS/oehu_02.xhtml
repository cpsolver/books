<h1>Scene 1, Our Middle Class Dreams</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Damien! Are you thinking of jumping off?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;With today's luck I'd land on something soft.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;You know we can't afford that hiccup. What's up?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm (slurred first word) feelin' low.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Why so?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My dream was to get to the middle class.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Of course, that's why you've been bustin' your ass.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Today my boss popped that bubble.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Is his business in trouble?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Nah, but he told me some stuff, about some laws that are rough.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The ones corporations can avoid?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, that's got me annoyed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Corporations are so corrupt!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And it's pushing us voters to be almost bankrupt. How can it be? That those of us who vote are not the ones keeping afloat? We're supposed to have democracy!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes we can vote, but the candidates stink. They're as sneaky as a coyote [pronounced to rhyme with "vote"].</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's a big kink in democracy. Why should that be?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Well it does seem crazy. Laws always favor the wealthy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But they are so few, and outnumbered by so many of us, making a big fuss. How can the rich outvote us? Is the only prognosis hopelessness?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;It's the political ads I suppose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We can see through those. Something's hidden. There's got to be another villian.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;A conspiracy? A dark-money tyranny?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I don't know. But as my dad would say, "Get to the root of the problem, that's where the solution lay."</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;My parents, they taught me, suit up, show up, pay attention, and then work very hard.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Willing to bust my ass, that I'm willin' to do. But are we, the majority, just buffalo being herded into a canyon to be slaughtered? Damn I want to know whose hand I should bite!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I agree it's not right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Financially, our life is so far upside down from where I want it to be. I wanna be an employer, but I'm just an employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I wanna be a princess, but I'm just a common lass.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Until that changes, we're fallin' on our ass. We have to choose. Do we own a car? Or eat some nice meals? We can't afford both.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Do we own a cozy home? Or raise a family? We can't afford both.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Do we save for rainy days? Or stay healthy? We can't afford both.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;We want a house and friends and laughter and joy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We don't need to travel far on plane or yacht. We just want time to enjoy what we've already got.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I do admit I love to travel. Do you want a chocolate truffle?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Something brown to get me down, no thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;They're delicious.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm suspicious. Something's hidden. I know my hard work is worth far more than what I get paid.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The trickle-down economy works for corporations, but not for us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Work and cash should come as a pair, but one without the other, that's not fair!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;We're stuck doing dull work for a boss that's usually such a jerk.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Fortunately the boss I've got is a saint compared to ones from my past. But now he says he's drowning. There's taxes and licenses and insurance and yet more fees. Just keeping track of these adds another employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;That leaves less money for you, and for us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I know how to invent but that don't pay the rent. Not yet. And it won't if I can't figure out how to own my own business.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;What are you going to do?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I want to set things right, so I'll just have to fight. But who? Who do I fight?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;We've now got internet communication and computers. So that should give us liberation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Or at least an answer to who we should fight.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;What can we do?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wanna discover what's at the root of unfairness in business and politics. But where can I start that journey?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Maybe you should take a college course in, maybe, political science? They teach about electoral college and gerry, uh, something, and how congress is supposed to work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I hate textbooks. They hurt my eyes. And my brain hurts when it tries to follow where the words try to take me. And tests, I hate those 'cause they just try to figure out whether you read the textbook.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;That fits my experiences.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Just being inside a classroom makes me feel so dumb, so ashamed. It's like going to a fight where I know I will lose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Ah yes, I forgot you flunked history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;History is just about the past that's gone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I admit I don't remember much.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And I flunked math classes. Mathematics terrifies me. And fractions I hate!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Alas you have to deal with evil fractions every day at work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I cringe when I get a measurement like thirteen and five sixteenths inches.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I wouldn't know what to do with that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why should I struggle in the academic world?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I admit I don't recall much at all from classes I took.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Anyway, do political scientists understand why politics is so upside down? For us voters, the majority? With rich on top n' us voters stuck in the mud of financial suffering?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;What can we do?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We have democracy. But it's not a full democracy. I long to figure out how it is that the majority of voters get outvoted by dollars from the top one percent.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I'll ask father. He might know someone who knows how we can earn more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I know I'm not the brightest bulb. But if there should be someone somewhere who really knows, and knows how to clearly explain in spoken words, why the world is so upside down. Then I'll stuggle to clearly understand who's to blame for corruption in Washington DC.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;And when you find out who's to blame, what comes next?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Then I'll know how to get around such unfairnesses. Then we can earn the money we deserve for working so hard for the masters we serve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I've read that suicide is done by men who can't find anyone else to blame. So if you don't figure this out, are you going to jump?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I won't jump. I'm not a chump. Not a quitter. I'll keep workin'. Yet I'm dyin'. To know why things are upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;As long as you're not dyin' on me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Some people say this is just the way it will always be. But that's not OK for me. It isn't fair! Getting ahead. Rising to the top. Why does it seem to happen just for jerks?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes, us hard workers deserve some perks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the wise deserve to win seats in Congress.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Why are the winners always liars?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And greedy. And con artists. We want to elect problem-solving leaders. But what do we get? Special-interest puppets. They do all sorts of bidding for the wealthy few. The top one percent. And what do they get?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Even richer!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And what do the rest of us get?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Treated like a light bulb. Screwed!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I want to change the world and turn it right side up!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The impossible. That's part of why I love you so. You want things to to be fair. You really care! But you'll need lots and lots of luck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yet with it I'll discover a way out of this muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;And then finally we can increase our prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And suffer less adversity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I'll ask father for some help.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And I will push my way through my non-braininess. I'll dig deep into the elephant and donkey dung! My sanity depends on it.</p>
