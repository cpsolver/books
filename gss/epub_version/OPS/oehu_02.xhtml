<h1>Scene 1, Our Middle Class Dreams</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K (Katerina):</span>&#160;<span class="explain">[Entering a high balcony through sliding glass doors.]</span> Damien! Are you thinking of jumping off?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D (Damien):</span>&#160;<span class="explain">[Always speaks with lazy pronunciation.]</span> With today's luck I'd land on somethin' soft.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Like a truck full of marshmallows? Or a fresh load of horse manure?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Or my head.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;That would put a dent ... in paying next month's rent. What's the matter?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I'm feelin' sadder than a limpin' seagull in winter in Seattle.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;How'd you get there? Why so abysmal?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Life's so unfair. My dream's been shattered.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Which dream's been fractured? The picket fence around a front yard that's big enough for a Saint Bernard?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;That's your dream. Mine was to enter the middle class.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Yeah, to gain that entrance you've been bustin' your ass.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;My butt's busted. What more does it take?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Maybe a secret handshake? What's up?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Today my boss popped my bubble.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Is his business in trouble?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Nah, but he told me some stuff, about some laws that're rough.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;The ones corporations can avoid?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Yeah, it's got me annoyed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Some corporations are sneakier than pickpockets, con artists, and kids giving away free kittens.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Us taxpayers get pushed to the edge. Don't they see? We're lookin' down into a volcano of molten lava called bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;You didn't tell me we're this close to the edge. How can this be?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;How is it we who vote aren't the ones keepin' afloat? We're supposed to have democracy!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Yes we can vote, but most candidates are wimpy puppets, or slimey con artists.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Or third-party spoilers. I hate that sulfurous stink when I have'ta mark the lesser fink.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Yeah it's a big kink in democracy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;How come laws favor the wealthy? We make a big fuss, yet the few rich outvote us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;What happens to our votes? Are we just rabbits living near a den of coyotes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I'm beginning to think the only prognosis is hopelessness.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Maybe it's hypnosis. Or the political ads I suppose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;We can see through those. Somethin's hidden. There's gotta be another villian.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;A conspiracy? A dark-money tyranny? Or a Bermuda pentagon with two sides missing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I dunno. But as my dad would say, <i>Get to the root of the problem, that's where the solution lay.</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;My parents, they said with a smirk, <i>Suit up, show up, pay attention, and then pretend to work work work</i>.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Yeah I'm willin' to bust my ass. But I'll give it a pass if we're followin' Native American footsteps.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Which footsteps?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Their shamans spoke <i>White chieftains are like lyin' wolves who herd us like buffalo. From our grazing lands onto dry deserts where foods don't grow. They feed their greed beyond their need.</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;We're bein' herded indeed. Something's not right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Damn I wanna know whose hand I should bite!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Financially, our life's so far upside down from where I want it to be.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I wanna be an employer, but I'm just an employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;I wanna be a princess. But do you see a tiara on my empty head?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;When dinner's got veggies 'n meat, our car's gas gauge says stay off the street.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;My dental smile gives us cheer, but now when dining out we can't afford beer. Our finances are dreadful.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;It's .... What's that word? Like evil. Like diablo.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Diabolical?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;That's it! It's diabolical! The wealthy say that money trickles down. Maybe it does, but not as fast as it drains from our wallet just for the bare necessities. They claim that workin' hard's a good bet. And yet, Las Vegas has better odds at roulette.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Do you want a chocolate truffle?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Somethin' brown to get me down? No thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;They're delicious.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I'm suspicious. Somethin's goin' on behind our backs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Yes, right in front of our eyes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Work 'n cash should come as a pair, but one without the other, that's not effin' fair!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Yeah, we're indentured to jerks and getting only table-scrap perks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;It ain't right. The boss I've got's almost a saint. Yet he says he's drownin' in taxes, 'n licenses, 'n insurance, 'n extra fees. Just keepin' track of these adds another employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;That leaves less money for me. Your paycheck's like a balloon with a leak.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Times are bleak. I know how to invent but that don't pay the rent. Not yet. 'N it won't if I'm not able to own my own biz.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;I've read that suicide is done by guys who can't find anyone else to blame. So who do you think's rigged the political game?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I dunno. Politics's so complex.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Yeah, everything interconnects.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Yet surely somewhere, maybe sittin' in a yoga pose on a high mountaintop, or kneelin' at an altar in a gothic cathedral, or standin' behind a counter askin' <i>Do you want cheezy garlic bread with your pasta?</i>, there's just gotta be a geek, or geekette, who knows the secret.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Even Google can't find that <span class="highlight">white grain of truth on a black sandy beach. <span class="explain">[OK as-is? fix_humor]</span></span></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;'Specially 'cause most online search has kickback associations with big corporations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Let's just say you found a guru who knew. What'd be your query, specifically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;How can we get better democracy? Wait. Not that. I'd ask <i>What's at the root of unfairness in politics 'n business?</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Bright professors teach at our city's college. In political science they teach about the electrical, er, electoral college, and German dating, er, gerrymandation, and such.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Katerina. You know I'd rather walk into a rattlesnake cage than turn another textbook page. Those pages shake my eyes faster than the snake's tail. My brain throbs as weaselly words try to drag me through dates 'n definitions, 'n the names of Thomas Jefferson's pets. 'N tests, those effin' devils, just rat out those of us who didn't read the textbook.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Now that's a real conspiracy. Textbooks and tests are in bed together, making baby test questions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Just bein' inside a classroom feels like I've stepped into a boxin' ring, wearing not boxing gloves, but instead holding pom poms.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Ah yes, community college classes already knocked you out for the count.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Does it matter? History's just fat with notes from the past that's gone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Just like an Elvis museum.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;My math teacher said a monkey with a bad r&#233;sum&#233; could have done better on his tests. 'N fractions, those were created by the devil ... when he was in a snit!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Yeah, I admit, I struggled a bit in the academic jungle. I tip-toed, and side-stepped, and a few times I tripped.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Anyways, political scientists, do they really understand how come politics's so perverted, so inverted? Surely, if they knew, then Congress would better the economy. 'N then we wouldn't be stuck in this financial muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;I suppose you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Who should I fight? Where's that thing, the tiltin' place?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;The tipping point?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Yeah, how can we, the majority, get to where we can outvote the endless dollars of one percenters?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Father knows some jet setters from a distance. I'll ask him for assistance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I know I'm not the sharpest banana in the fruit basket. But if there should be a really sharp banana, someone maybe who can tell me, without pointing to a big book, why the world's so upside down. Then I'll stuggle to learn. And then I'll stuggle to turn things right side up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;When you find out who's to blame, for corruption in the governmental game, what comes after that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Then I'll shift from workin' hard for the masters we serve to earning the money we deserve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;If you don't get out of your slump, are you gonna jump?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I won't jump. I'm not a chump. It might take awhile, but I'll jump back on the crocodile 'n keep on ridin'. 'Cause I'm dyin'. To know how come things are upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;As long as you're not dyin' on me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Some people say this is just the way it'll always be. But it's not OK. It's not fair! Seats in Congress should go to the wise. Yet sitting there now are selfish liars. We wanna elect problem-solving leaders, but what do we get? Egotistic special-interest puppets whose masters treat us like light bulbs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Yeah, screwed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;I wanna change the world 'n turn it right side up!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;The impossible. That's part of why I love you so. You want things to to be fair. You really care! But you'll need lots and lots of luck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;Yet with it I hope to discover a way outta this muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;Then finally we can reach prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;'N suffer less adversity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_fiance">K:</span>&#160;I'll ask father for assistance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singer_damien">D:</span>&#160;'N I, the dunce, will use my soft brain. As a shovel to dig down deep into elephant 'n donkey shit! My sanity depends on it.</p>
