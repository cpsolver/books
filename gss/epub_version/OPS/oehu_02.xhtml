<h1>Scene 1, Our Middle Class Dreams</h1>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Damien! Are you thinking of jumping off?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;With today's luck I'd land on something soft.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Like a truck full of pumpkins? Or a fresh load of horse manure?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Or my head.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;That would put a dent in paying next month's rent. What's the matter?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm (slurred first word) feelin' sadder than a deaf seagull.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Why so abysmal?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Life's so unfair. My dream's been shattered.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Which dream's been fractured? The picket fence around a front yard that's big enough for a Saint Bernard?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's your dream. Mine was to enter the middle class.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, to gain that entrance you've been bustin' your ass.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My butt is busted. What more does it take?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Maybe a secret handshake?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Today my boss popped my bubble.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Is his business in trouble?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Nah, but he told me some stuff, about some laws that are rough.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The ones corporations can avoid?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, that's got me annoyed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Some corporations are sneakier than pickpockets, drug dealers, and kids giving away free kittens.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Us taxpayers get pushed to the edge. Don't they see? We're looking down into a volcano of molten lava called bankruptcy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;You didn't tell me we're close to the edge. How can this be?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How is it that we who vote aren't the ones keepin' afloat? We're supposed to have democracy!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes we can vote, but most candidates are wimpy puppets, or slimey con artists.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Or third-party spoilers. I hate that sulfurous stink when I have to mark the lesser fink.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah it's a big kink in democracy. Laws always favor the wealthy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We make a big fuss, yet the rich outvote us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Even though they're fewer in number than rabbits near a den of coyotes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is the only prognosis hopelessness?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Maybe it's hypnosis? Or the political ads I suppose.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We can see through those. Something's hidden. There's got to be another villian.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;A conspiracy? A dark-money tyranny? Or a Bermuda pentagon with two sides missing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I dunno. But as my dad would say, "Get to the root of the problem, that's where the solution lay."</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;My parents, they taught me, suit up, show up, pay attention, and then pretend to work work work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Willing to bust my ass, that I'm willin' to do. But not if we're following the footsteps of Native Americans.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Footsteps?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;They said "White chiefs are like wolves who herd us like buffalo, in winter through snow, from our grazing lands onto dry deserts where foods don't grow. They steal our lands to fuel their greed beyond their need."</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;We're being herded indeed. Something's not right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Damn I want to know whose hand I should bite!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Financially, our life is so far upside down from where I want it to be.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wanna be an employer, but I'm just an employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I wanna be a princess. But do you see a tiara on my empty head?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, we're upside down. It lets money drain out of our pockets. Our finances are in the red, but they should be black instead.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;If my dental smile gives us cheer, at dinner out we can't afford beer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If our dinner's got veggies and meat, our car's gas gauge says stay off the street.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Do you want a chocolate truffle?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Something brown to get me down, no thanks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;They're delicious.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm suspicious. Something's going on behind our backs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes, right in front of our eyes. The trickle-down economy works for corporations, but not for us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Work and cash should come as a pair, but one without the other, that's not effing fair!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, we're indentured to jerks and getting only a few small perks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;The boss I've got's almost a saint. But now he says he's drownin'. There's taxes and licenses, and insurance, and extra fees. Just keepin' track of these adds another employee.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;That leaves less money for me. Your paycheck's like a balloon with a leak.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Times are bleak. I know how to invent but that don't pay the rent. Not yet. And it won't if I'm not victorious owning my own business.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I've read that suicide is done by guys who can't find anyone else to blame. So who do you think has rigged the political game?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I dunno. Politics's so complex.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yeah, everything interconnects.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yet surely somewhere, maybe sitting in a yoga pose on a high mountaintop, or kneeling at an altar in a cathedral, or standing behind a counter asking "Do you want cheezy garlic bread with your pasta?", there's just gotta be a geek, or geekette, who knows the secret.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Even Google can't find that needle in the online haystack.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;'Specially 'cause most online search has kickback associations with big corporations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Let's just say you found a guru who knew. What would you ask, specifically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How can we get better democracy? Wait, not that. I'd ask "What's at the root of unfairness in politics and business?"</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Bright professors teach at our city's college. In political science they teach about the electrical college, and German dating, er, gerrymandation, and such.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'd rather walk into a rattlesnake cage than turn another textbook page. Those pages shake my eyes faster than the snake's tail. My brain throbs as weaselly words try to drag me through names and dates, and definitions. Plus facts I'll never use. And tests, those effing devils, just rat out those of us who didn't read the textbook.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Now that's a real conspiracy. Textbooks and tests are in bed together.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Just being inside a classroom feels like I've stepped into a boxing ring wearing not boxing gloves but holding pom poms.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Ah yes, community college classes already knocked you out for the count.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Does it matter? History's just fat with notes from the past that's gone.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Just like an Elvis museum.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My math teacher said a monkey with a bad resume could have done better on his tests. And fractions, those were created by the devil when he was in a snit!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, I admit, I struggled a bit in the academic jungle. I tip-toed, and side-stepped, and a few times I tripped.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Anyway, political scientists, do they really understand why politics's so perverted that it's inverted. Surely, if they knew, we wouldn't be stuck in this financial muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I suppose you're right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Who should I fight? Where's that thing, the tilting place?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The tipping point?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, how can we, the majority, get to the point where we can outvote the endless dollars of one percenters?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Father knows some jet setters from a distance. I'll ask him for assistance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I know I'm not the sharpest banana in the fruit basket. But if there should be a really sharp banana who can tell me, without pointing to some heavy book, why the world's so upside down, then I'll stuggle to learn those secrets.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;And when you find out who's to blame for corruption in the governmental game, what comes next?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Then I'll shift from working hard for the masters we serve to earning the money we deserve.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;If you don't get out of your slump, are you going to jump?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I won't jump. I'm not a chump. It might take awhile, but I'll jump back on the crocodile and keep on ridin'. 'Cause I'm dyin'. To know why things are upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;As long as you're not dyin' on me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Some people say this is just the way it will always be. But it's not OK. It's not fair! Getting ahead. Rising to the top. Why does it seem to happen just for jerks and windbags?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yes, us hard workers deserve some perks too.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Seats in Congress should go to the wise.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Yet elections are won by selfish liars.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We want problem-solving leaders. What d' we get?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Money-controlled special-interest puppets.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What d' the puppet-masters get?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Even richer!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the rest of us get what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Treated like a light bulb. Screwed!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I wanna change the world and turn it right side up!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;The impossible. That's part of why I love you so. You want things to to be fair. You really care! But you'll need lots and lots of luck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yet with it I hope to discover a way out of this muck.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;Then finally we can reach prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And suffer less adversity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Katerina:</span>&#160;I'll ask father for assistance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And I, the dunce, will use my soft brain. As a shovel to dig down deep into elephant and donkey shit! My sanity depends on it.</p>
