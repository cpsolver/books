<p class="action">Action: Desha and Damien enter classroom.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Are you professor Pengaritihas?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes. Are you two Demon and Dasha?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm Desha.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm Damien.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Welcome to my classroom. Would you like some pistachios?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I already have plenty of nuts. But I'm hungry to learn.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;We're hoping you can help us figure out what will happen when vote splitting is eliminated by adopting fairer election methods.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's not goat spitting. It's vote splitting. And yes I can answer that question.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We know it's a bit challenging to predict the future.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's mostly what us economists are paid to do. Predict the future.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Are they, well you too, usually right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Sometimes yes, and then we try to get media attention. Sometimes no, and then we do research and write an academic paper to explain why we were wrong.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Do you have a general idea about what would change?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Of course. A few people who greatly profit from existing conditions will earn less money, and almost everyone else will enjoy increased prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What is your justification? For that prediction?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That trend has been going on throughout civilization and history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Can you explain why it will happen this way?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Imagine the economy as a strawberry pie.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm not fond of strawberry pie. Can we call it a cherry pie?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Of course. Now imagine the economy is a cherry pie. If some people cut themselves a slice that is too big, then other people end up with smaller slices.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm following this.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;What would you like to call the people who take too big of a slice?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;People in the political down. As opposed to the political left and political right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And the people who get too little would be people in the political up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Interesting. I like that view. It makes sense. So, the way I see it, fairer elections would yield elected leaders who care more about the people you call the political up. Currently they get too little economic pie. So of course they would elect politicians who would pass laws that are fairer for themselves, the majority of voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This seems simple.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;When I took the introduction to ecomomics course it was much more complicated than this.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;We'll get to the complicated part soon, and that involves a bit of history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear, not history. I learned some, but what does the past have to do with the future?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;History is like a crystal ball. It reveals so very much.</p>
<p class="action">Action: Professor Pengaritihas walks backwards.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Imagine that walking backwards is like moving forward in time. I can see the future not. The past is what I've got. As I walk into the future I peer into the past. The past gives clues about where we're headed. Without that guide we'd end up on our ass. History! History! That is our way to see that which is yet to be.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wow! History is about the future. Who knew?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Most people think that history is just facts about the past.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And for that we've got Wikipedia. It has a much better memory than I do.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's a great way to learn history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My eyes are hurting just thinking about such reading.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You said that blue-tinted reading glasses help with books. There's a way to make a browser change Wikipedia's white background to a different tint.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll try that some time.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;What's really much more interesting about history, rather than facts, is causation. And unintended consequences.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Can you give an example?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Here's an example that involves snakes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The political kind?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Cobras.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I like them, at a distance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A city in India had a problem with lots of cobra snakes, so they put a bounty on the snakes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I recognize bounty as another word for money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;So how would you expect that to turn out?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Fewer cobra snakes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Since you're using it as an example, I'll guess the number of snakes increased.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Indeed, the cobra population increased. So the test question is: why?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I hate tests. My brain freezes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Flunk! With your brain, try to maintain your focus on the topic, the subject, the concept. Don't try to push away the fear. Instead let go of the fear. If instead you struggle then you are clinging to the emotion. So cut that umbilical connection. Let go of fear.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Got it. I'll focus on the topic of snakes. There's less fear there.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So why did the snake population increase?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;When money gets offered for something then people do what it takes to get that money. Enterprising city residents went into the cobra snake breeding business.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll guess that after realizing what was going on, the bounty was ended and those extra snakes got released?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus! That's what happened. This historical event from the past reminds us to consider otherwise unexpected consequences.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;There are lots of awful unfair consequences of congress and it's corruption, but those shouldn't be unexpected.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Now let's look at one of the problems that economists face. You've heard of the gross domestic product, the GDP?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yes, it measures, well, when it goes up, that's good, and when it goes down, that's bad.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;So here's the next test question. Does the GDP go up or down when a family's house burns down?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This seems like yet again a trick question so I'll say GDP goes up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;C plus. For an A you need to tell me why.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Because building the replacement house, or more likely the selling of the property to a developer who builds a condominium, is business activity, and that's what GDP measures.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus. Yes, GDP just measures transfers of money. When nothing is bought or sold there is no change in gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what does this have to do with election method reform?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;When people are optimistic about the future, the GDP goes up because people are more likely to buy products and eat out and buy services. But when people are pessimistic about the future they cling to their money, which means that there are fewer transfers of money, and that reduces the GDP.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And you think that people will become optimistic when fairer voting methods are adopted?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The short answer is yes. The fuller answer involves what's happening now in the economy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I keep hearing that the economy is great, and that unemployment is down, and inflation is low. But I sure don't feel like the economy is good for me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The stock market keeps going up and up because people with money have few other places to invest it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That gives the stock market sort of a monopoly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, and inflation being low is related to interest rates being low, so money put into certificates of deposit don't yield much interest.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So stocks are over-inflated. Does that mean soon they'll go down?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's difficult to predict when it will go down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I thought you said economists predict the future.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Getting the timing exactly right is what the best investors do. But professors of economics get a salary.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Fortune tellers who teach?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Never mind.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So why does the economy not work for me, even though the numbers say that everything is fine? Is this an example of mathiness?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I don't know what mathiness is. But numbers can be deceptive. What many people overlook is that the unemployment rate that's in the news just counts people who are now getting unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Those benefits run out after a few months of having no job. I've learned that from experience. So unemployment is actually higher?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, it's higher.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why don't economists measure that? The real unemployment rate?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The government does measure that unemployment rate as well, but most newspapers and TV stations report the one that government officials call attention to.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So the government is being sneaky, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The government knows that if they report a higher unemployment rate then all that optimism disappears. Then the economy and the GDP would trend downward. And that would activate a bad feeback loop.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;A feedback loop?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;When you are at an auditorium and the sound system squeals, that's a feedback loop. A tiny sound at the microphone gets amplified and comes out the speakers and gets back to the microphone just slightly louder than before, and the cycle continues with increasing volume.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, the government is tinkering with what they can control, and trying to keep the US economy growing, but not over-growing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's the concept. Of course my students have to learn special words to say it academically correct.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Otherwise they would get bad grades on standardized tests, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Alas, yes. I have to teach to the tests. Yet the important parts of economics are the concepts, and that's why it's a delight to get to explain them to you two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So why does it seem that rent and food and stuff are going up and up, yet what we earn can't keep up?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's not your imagination. The cost of living is going up. But the cost of housing, and of fuel, and some foods, are not measured in the consumer price index, which is the official measurement of inflation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So the big costs like rent and fuel and food aren't included? That's corrupt!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;There are some food items on the list. But some years ago when food items were rising in price, a few were replaced with the cost of things that are declining.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's declining in cost?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The per-pixel cost of digital cameras.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I recognize that word "per." It means division. And the number of pixels in a camera are going up, so dividing by that bigger number makes the result go down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So that's another way that the government is hiding the real cost of living. I can guess why they are not being transparent. But something else is going on, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Government expenses such as the interest they pay for borrowed money, and pensions, those are matched to the inflation rate. So low inflation reduces expenses for government. The reason rent and fuel are excluded is they are too volatile.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is there anything else being fudged?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Desha do you remember from econ 101 [one oh one] what determines interest rates?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The Federal Reserve chooses when to increase and decrease the interest rate, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That is the rate reported in the news, but more important is the rate determined by auctioning Treasuries.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I don't remember learning this.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's not taught.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'll bet textbooks don't include it because governments fund schools, so they get to choose the textbooks.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, another feedback loop. Anyway, U.S. Treasuries are sold in auctions. In economically optimistic times they sell for higher prices, closer to the amount the government pays when they reach their redemption date.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, but in economically pessimistic times the buyers pay much less. That increases the gap between purchase price and redemption payment. So that brings up rates of interest, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, I think I'm following. Since interest rates are low, that means there are lots of buyers for U.S. Treasuries?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus. Yes, normally, but China and Russia stopped buying them so lately the Federal Reserve has been buying lots of them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That would be like a business buying its own products to give the appearance that they have lots of customers and income.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And that's why the deficit is so huge.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so the U.S. government has increased it's debt to compensate for rough times economically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Wait a moment. Our economy's a house of cards that's ready to fall?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Almost all nations and all big businesses are in debt. So are farmers. They all have to borrow first before they can grow crops or manufacture or whatever to get income.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So being in debt is not a big deal, but a growing deficit, that's bad, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Relatively speaking, yes. But as long as the government is keeping its citizens happy, and happier than in other nations, there's no problem.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what should be going on instead?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;History tells us that prosperity happens when a city, nation, or region sells something that people outside the region want to pay lots for.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;An example would help.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Consider the Roman empire. They grew olives and sold olive oil. They sold it around the coast of the mediteranean sea, where olive trees did not grow so easily. Better still they wrote and enforced wise laws about business and commerce. And they built roads. And channeled water to cities. All of that greatly increased their trading efficiency.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Efficiency?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Profit goes up when costs go down. And costs go down when people waste less time fetching water and breaking cart wheels on bad roads. And costs go down when citizens stay healthy. And costs go down when people waste less time fighting each other, including in court.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So why did the Roman empire decline?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Careful, there are huge books and entire courses on this subject.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I'll give you just the relevant part. After the years of good governance, when things were prosperous, corruption grew. And corruption reduced efficiency. Partly because more time was wasted fighting. There was more fighting in courts and between businesses, and against rebellions, and fighting within aristocratic families. That loss of productivity made it weaker, and harder to defend against attackers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So efficiency and selling what's desireable is what brings money into a region. And then corruption leads to waste, inefficiency, and economic decline.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes. And the same pattern happened later with the Italian Renessance which started with efficient banking and improved ships using technology from China.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The compass, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And the ship's rudder.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And gunpowder too, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Certainly that enabled seagoing people to exploit other regions and their resources.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Now that I better understand that transporting manufactured items between Europe and Asia was what ships were being used for, I realize that running into America and taking land from the natives, and enslaving Africans to work on plantations in the Carribean, was a bonus. And giving religious folks a place where they could escape corruption was just, for us, a lucky byproduct?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Basically, yes. And it gave democracy a place to grow, far away from big armies and navys.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So how can we, the United States, increase our efficiency?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;First and foremost, let's not make the same mistakes that other nations have made. That leads to other nations taking the lead.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;An example?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;When England was prosperous they raised tariffs as a way to increase their income, or so they thought. That new barrier gave Dutch people a trading advantage, because they had no such tariffs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So higher tariffs on English goods motivated other nations to trade with the Dutch instead of the English? And isn't that when Protestants moved to Holland to escape religious persecution in England?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Very good! A free market means that buyers and sellers do business with whoever offers the best value.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's why Amazon does so well? It uses computers to replace the inefficiency of people, such as in retail stores working as clerks, making change, and answering questions from customers. So customers now can buy online. And they can quickly find products that local stores would never keep in stock. And going into stores wasted lots of time and fuel, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;You're getting this! Congratulations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;In contrast, monopolies limit who customers can buy from. So here in the U.S. we have to buy sugar that's made from sugar cane that's grown in Florida, so we are wasting lots of money that could be spent on other things if we bought our sugar from outside the U.S., right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Excellent. But some of what's wasted isn't just money or products. Consider what happened in Britain during World War One. It was popular for university-educated men to volunteer to fight in that war.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, getting killed in the trenches wasted a lot of knowledge and skills.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And that caused a bad feedback loop because it reduced the people who could educate the next generation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so that's why men in college get excluded from getting drafted during times of war. Knowledge and skills are also resources that can get used efficiently or wasted.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Which is why NASA lost it's ability to make rockets for taking astronauts to the space station.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And why now NASA has to buy space on Russian rockets.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;So now I can answer your question. The most effective way for a government to increase prosperity is to increase taxes on activities that are wasteful or inefficient. And to decrease taxes on activities that are efficient and bring a net flow of money into the region. In this case the region is the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So which activities are which?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Let's consider some different kinds of businesses. How about farming?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That brings money in. If the crops are sold outside the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Which is part of why farmers get lots of special government subsidies. How about manufacturing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That brings money in, when the products are sold outside the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I thought that manufacturing businesses were bad.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;There are some that pay little, and mistreat their employees, and pollute, but they don't need to be bad. The good ones deserve lower taxes because they efficiently hire skilled workers who transform raw materials into valuable products worth lots of money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So software businesses deserve lower taxes? They bring lots of money into the United States from other nations, and they just consume electricity. And they hire highly skilled software developers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Great example. How about mining companies?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;They bring lots of money into the U.S., but doesn't the U.S. lose lots of natural resources that future generations will come to appreciate?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes. Like Japan, where they cut down their forests for firewood, and so now they buy lots of timber from the U.S. Or did back when lots and lots of logging was done in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So mining and timber businesses deserve to pay higher taxes, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The word "deserve" is judgemental, so that's a matter of opinion. But, yes, if mining and timber industries sell lots of materials now, then future generations will not be getting as much income from those sources in the future.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Short-sighted capitalists.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Speaking of that, what is capitalism? It's confusing to me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's because the word has come to have lots of meanings. Of course textbooks give it a carefully worded definition.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Which explains why so much of what I learned in school now seems so useless compared to this, what you're teaching us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's a joy to really get to teach! Now, back to what doesn't have an official name. How about artists, writers, composers, and other people who create things that can be sold for way more than the cost of electricity and art supplies and creative software?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Clearly they deserve lower taxes on their businesses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, I see something else! Suppose Wall Street businesses and law offices were taxed more. Their employees would earn less than they do now. So the smartest employees on Wall Street would move to software and manufacturing businesses where they would earn more because those businesses would be taxed less. That job migration would increase U.S. prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Hey, that would mean higher taxes on my future business because I'm not a smart guy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Does this guy really not know how smart he is?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;He hasn't done much reading so he's not book smart. But he's very smart in common sense, which is alas too uncommon.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If I'm so smart, why did I flunk out of community college?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Because you have a reading disability that schools do not test for. That makes schools stupid.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Well we did learn that education needs a revolution.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So what's this called? This thing of imposing lower taxes on businesses that efficiently create things of value, and imposing higher taxes on businesses that waste resources or don't attract as much net flow of value into the United States?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's an idea still in its infancy so it doesn't have an established name. I've only heard it called "tax the takers more than the makers."</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I like that. Those of us who are driven to create value would work for businesses that are taxed less. And we would earn higher wages because of those lower taxes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And corporations would pay much higher taxes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Only some corporations would pay higher taxes. Other corporations create lots of valuable products and services, and they would pay low taxes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Which corporations create value? I thought that big corporations are wasteful.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The Corporation For Public Broadcasting creates lots of great educational TV shows for kids.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, I suppose it's like with rich people. Some are good, and some are bad. I have to pay attention to what they do.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Indeed. And I'll say I'm glad you see that simply taxing wealthy individuals isn't the key.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I learned they hide yachts, cabins, fancy cars, and such in the businesses that they own. So they can evade individual taxation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And it's harder to figure out which rich folks deserve to be wealthy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;None of them!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Can you not think of any wealthy people who deserve to earn lots of money for their work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My boss, and other owners of small construction businesses like the one I work in. And Elon Musk because he is making big overdue changes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I suppose Oprah Winfrey is a good example of someone who deserves her wealth. And Stephen Colbert because he makes me laugh about the craziness of politics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And they are all in the political up, along with us voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's hard to judge which individuals are in the political up versus down. It's easier to do with businesses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;With individuals we just need to look at how much they give to politicians.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's difficult to trace. It's easier to separate the takers from the makers in businesses. We just look at what the business does.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;There are some kinds of businesses that I'm not sure if they would be takers or makers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;In general the spectrum from makers to takers would be something like this. It starts with farming and ranching then to manufacturing, cooking, brewing, entertaining, engineering, inventing, software developing, oil refining, research if it isn't market research, and other such making activities. Then to teaching and training. Then to maintenance and healthcare. Then to shipping, retail stores, hospitality, meat packing, canning, and more. Then to advertising and marketing. Then finally to banking, insurance, legal services, logging, mining, casinos, tobacco and alcohol businesses, and last but not least, real estate developers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That all makes sense to me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I love it! Especially with real estate buggers at the bottom paying the highest tax rates. And now it's finally so much clearer who I should fight! And how I can fight!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you're saying that better voting methods would allow us voters to elect politicians who would pass laws that change business taxes to encourage efficiency and net flow of money into the United States, and discourage wastefulness and earning money mostly from customers within the United States?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I'm not saying what should be done, or will be done. I'm saying that economic prosperity would increase if those changes were made.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And it would only decrease prosperity for a few people who earn their money by owning taker businesses? That sounds great!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm ready for this fight!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Hey! I see a pattern. The owners of taker businesses are in the political down, and currently their businesses get so many tax breaks that they pay low tax rates. And the owners of maker businesses, like the one I work in and the one I'd like to build, they are in the political up! And they pay high tax rates, and get few tax breaks. The economy is upside down!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Yes! The economic world is so very upside down! It's time to turn the world right side up!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Alas, yes, the economic world is upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I think we've now got the insights we came for.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But I have one more big thing I'd like to know. Since you predict the future, how are things going to work out regarding climate change?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Of course I cannot know what will actually happen, but I can point out that some feedback loops are steering us toward climate disaster.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Losing the snow and ice at the north and south poles means that sunlight there is not getting reflected back into space, and that sunlight is getting absorbed as heat, and that heat ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;... is melting more snow and ice. So what are the other feedback loops?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;As you have discovered, vote splitting is part of a feedback loop that keeps the owners of fossil-fuel businesses in political power where they can oppose solutions such as synthetic hydrocarbon fuel.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's synthetic whatever?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel refers to gases and liquids that can be manufactured using sunlight as the energy source and it gets carbon from the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Which we have too much of.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;... and it gets hydrogen from water.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So doing what plants do?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, but much more efficiently. Especially compared to using plants to generate ethanol, which involves a few very wealthy people who have a monopoly on ethanol.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If synthetic hydro ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Synthetic hydrocarbon fuel</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;... is such a good thing, what's blocking that from happening?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;There is no economic incentive. The people who have the skills to figure it out cannot get paid to do that research.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, another bad feedback loop. So, is there something from history that would reveal how that can change, and even get accelerated?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;When Kodak tried to develop, so to speak, color film for cameras, their research labs were only making slow progress. But two young chemistry graduates were making better progress, so Kodak hired them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What was the secret that gave them an advantage?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;They were singers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The secret was singing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;At that time darkrooms were completely dark, so there was no way to see a timer. Yet the chemistry was very time-critical. So they sang songs together and used the timing of songs as their timer for chemical reactions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So you're saying we need to take up singing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It illustrates that breakthroughs often require sub-breakthroughs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So this means we need to figure out some kind of innovation that will help to spread the bigger innovation of fairer voting methods?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;If you two are right and fairer voting will reduce corruption, then find a way to break the bad feedback loops that block fairer voting. The resulting reduced corruption will dramatically increase economic prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This is all so valuable! But my head is full! Desha, let's talk this stuff over on the ride back home, shall we?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Of course! What else would we want to talk about?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;You've helped us so much! How can we repay you?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Make the world a better place! And get it right! Less corruption would help nearly everyone. And the few who lose would still have their huge bank accounts, so they and their families will not suffer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Thank you professor Pengaritihas so much for your valuable time. It was well worth the three-hour drive to come meet with you!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Good luck! You'll need it. And remember that you didn't learn any of this from me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We know how this works, so we promise!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;We promise!</p>
