<p class="action">Action: Desha and Damien enter classroom.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Are you professor Pengaritihas?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes. Are you two Demon and Dasha?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm Desha.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm Damien.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Welcome to my classroom. Would you like some pistachios?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm so full of nuts I could get a squirrel through winter. But I'm hungry to learn.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Basically we're hoping you can help us figure out what will happen when election counting is fairer.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;When vote splittin's no longer a problem.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's not goat spitting. It's vote splitting. And yes I can answer that question.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;We know it's a bit challenging to predict the future.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's mostly what us economists are paid to do. Predict the future.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Are they, well you too, usually right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Sometimes yes, and then we modestly say <i>I told you so</i>. Sometimes no, and then we apply for a research grant to study why we were wrong.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Do you have a general idea about what would change?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Of course. A few people who greatly profit from existing conditions will earn less money, and almost everyone else will enjoy increased prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's your justification? For that prediction?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That trend has been going on throughout civilization and history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why will it happen this way?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Imagine the economy as a strawberry pie.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm not fond of strawberry pie. Can we call it a cherry pie?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Of course. Now imagine the economy is a cherry pie. If some people cut themselves a slice that is too big, then other people end up with smaller slices.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm following this. Wow!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;What would you like to call the people who take too big of a slice?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;People in the political down. As opposed to the political left and political right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And the people who get too little would be people in the political up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Interesting. Those names makes sense. So, the way I see it, fairer elections would yield elected leaders who care more about the people you call the political up. Currently those people get too little economic pie. So of course the replacement politicians would pass laws that give bigger slices of economic pie to the majority of voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This seems simple.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;When I took economics one oh one, it was much more complicated than this.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;We'll get to the complicated part soon, and that involves a bit of history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh dear, not history. I learned some, but what's the past got to do with the future?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Imagine that walking backwards [walks backward] is like moving forward in time. [pointing over shoulder] The future I cannot see [pointing straight ahead] so I peer into the past. That gives me clues about where we're headed. So it's like a crystal ball. History allows us to see that which is yet to be.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wow! History is about the future. Who knew?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Many people think that history is recalling facts about the past.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;In a hist'ry trivia contest Wikipedia would beat me like a marching-band drum.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Reading Wikipedia would be a great way to learn history.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;M' eyes start to cry just thinking about reading Wikipedia so much.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You said that reading glasses with a blue tint helps with books. You can change Wikipedia's white background to blue on a browser.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll try that.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;What's really much more interesting about history, rather than facts, is causation. And unintended consequences.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;C'n you give an example?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Here's an example that involves snakes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The political kind?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Cobras.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I like them, at a distance.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A city in India had a problem with lots of cobra snakes, so they put a bounty on the snakes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I recognize bounty as another word for money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;So how would you expect that to turn out?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Fewer cobra snakes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Since you're using it as an example, I'll guess the number of snakes increased.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Indeed, the cobra population increased. So the test question is: why?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I hate tests. My brain freezes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Flunk! With your brain, try to maintain your focus on the topic, the subject, the concept. Don't try to push away the fear. Instead let go of the fear. It shouldn't be a struggle. Just un-cling to the emotion. That cuts the umbilical connection. Let go of fear.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Got it. I'll focus on the topic of snakes. There's less fear there.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So why did the snake population increase?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;When money gets offered for something then people do what it takes to get that money. Enterprising city residents went into the cobra snake breeding business.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'll guess that after realizing what was going on, the bounty was ended and those extra snakes got released?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus! That's what happened. This historical event reminds us to consider otherwise unexpected consequences.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;There are lots of awful unfair consequences of Congress and its corruption, but those shouldn't be unexpected.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Let's look at one of the problems that economists face. You've heard of the gross domestic product, the GDP?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, it measures, well, when it goes up, that's good, and when it goes down, that's bad.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;So here's the next test question. Does the GDP go up or down when a family's house burns down?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;This seems like yet again a trick question so I'll say GDP goes up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;C plus. For an A you need to tell me why.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Because building the replacement house, or more likely the selling of the property to a developer who builds a condominium, is business activity, and that's what GDP measures.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus. Yes, GDP just measures transfers of money. When nothing is bought or sold there's no change in gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What does this have to do with election method reform?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And people are optimistic about the future, the GDP goes up because people are more likely to buy products, pay for services, eat out, and make babies. But when people are pessimistic about the future, they fearfully cling to their money and postpone making babies, so there are fewer transfers of money, and fewer future customers, and that pulls GDP down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;N' you think that people will become optimistic when fairer voting methods are adopted?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The short answer is yes. The fuller answer involves what's happening now in the economy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I keep hearing the economy's on the climbing path of a roller coaster. But I sure don't feel like the economy is good for me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The stock market keeps going up and up because people with money have few other places to invest it. Specifically certificates of deposit don't yield much interest.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That gives the stock market sort of a monopoly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So stocks are over-inflated. Does that mean our roller coaster ride will soon plummet?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's difficult to predict when it will go down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I thought you said economists predict the future.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Knowing <i>what</i> will happen is different from knowing <i>when</i> those whats will happen. Successful investors, the ones who earn lots of money trading stocks, predict the timing. But professors of economics just get a salary.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Fortune tellers who teach?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Never mind.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So why doesn't the economy work for me, even though the numbers say everything is fine? Is this an example of mathiness?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I don't know what mathiness is. But numbers can be deceptive. What many people overlook is that the unemployment rate that's in the news just counts people who are now getting unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Those benefits run out after a few months of having no job. I've learned that from experience. So unemployment is actually higher?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, it's higher.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why don't economists measure that? The real unemployment rate?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The government does measure that unemployment rate as well, but most newspapers and TV stations report the one that government officials call attention to.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So the government is being sneaky, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The government knows that if they call attention to the higher unemployment rate, then all that optimism disappears. Then the economy and the GDP would trend downward. And that would activate a bad feedback loop.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's a weed black poop?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A feedback loop. When you're in an auditorium and the sound system squeals, that's a feedback loop.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh yeah. That's when a tiny sound at the microphone gets amplified and comes out the speakers and gets back to the microphone just slightly louder than before.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It becomes as loud as possible very quickly. A similar feedback loop is behind economic inflation. When an employee who makes squirt guns gets a raise, the business raises the price of their squirt guns. A mother working in a grocery store then gets a raise to afford rising toy prices. Then the grocery store slightly raises its prices to cover that salary increase. Then that feeds back to the original employee who shops at that grocery store.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's inflation, when salaries and prices increase together.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That feedback loop has to be slowed down by doing something that decouples at least one of the links in the loop.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So announcing a higher rate of unemployment would undermine optimism, bringing down the economy. And that would cause more layoffs, which speeds up how fast the economy goes down. This makes sense.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Governments try to make the economy grow. But without allowing inflation to inflate too fast.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's the concept. Of course my students have to say it academically correctly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Otherwise they would get bad grades on standardized tests, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Alas, yes. I have to teach to the tests. Yet the important parts of economics are the concepts, and that's why it's a delight to get to explain them to you two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now that I know about feedback loops I see that rich business owners use them to get ever more of the economic pie. But why does it seem that rent and food and stuff are going up and up fast while salaries don't?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's not your imagination. The cost of living is going up faster than the consumer price index, which is the official measurement of inflation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's yet another flawed measurement. But I forget why this one is corrupt.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;You didn't forget. We can't teach why to undergrads. The why is because back when the price of food items were quickly rising, some food items were replaced by items whose cost were declining.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's declining in cost?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The per-pixel cost of digital cameras.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I recognize that word <i>per</i>. It means division. And the number of pixels in a camera are going up, so dividing by that bigger number makes the result go down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So that's another way the government is hiding the real cost of living. I can guess why they're not being transparent. But something else is going on, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes. Some government expenses are matched to the inflation rate. Such as the interest they pay for borrowed money, and retirement pensions for government employees, and social security benefits. So of course the government wants inflation to stay low.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So the government saves lots of money by pretending inflation is low.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes. Rent and fuel are rising quickly. But they're excluded because they're too volatile.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That means they jump around a lot.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is anything else being fudged?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Desha do you remember from econ one oh one what determines interest rates?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The federal reserve chooses when to increase and decrease the interest rate, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's the rate talked about in the news, but more important is the rate determined by auctioning treasuries.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I don't remember learning this.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's not taught. At least not to undergrads.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'll bet textbooks don't include it because schools are funded by the government. So textbooks can't reveal secrets the government wants to hide.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, that's another feedback loop. Anyway, U.S. treasuries are sold in auctions. In economically optimistic times they sell for higher prices, closer to the amount the government pays when they reach their redemption date.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, but in economically pessimistic times the buyers pay much less. That increases the gap between purchase price and redemption payment. So that brings up rates of interest, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, I think I'm following. Since interest rates are low, that means there are lots of buyers for those treasuries?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus. Yes, normally, but China and Russia stopped buying them so lately the federal reserve has been buying lots of them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That would be like the squirt gun business buying its own products to give the appearance of extra customers and income.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's partly why the deficit is so huge.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so the U.S. government has increased its debt to compensate for rough times economically?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Wait a moment. Our economy's like a stack of wood blocks in a teetering tower that's ready to fall?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Almost all nations and all big businesses are in debt. So are farmers. They all have to borrow first before they can grow crops or manufacture or whatever to get income.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So being in debt is not a big deal, but a growing deficit, that's bad, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Relatively speaking, yes. But as long as the government is keeping its citizens happy, and happier than in other nations, there's no problem.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The number of people trying to immigrate into the U.S. is still high, right? So that's a success. Yet things are a mess.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what should be going on instead?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;History tells us that prosperity happens when a city, nation, or region sells something that people outside the region either need or strongly desire. And it's not available from anywhere else.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;An example would help.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Do you know what the silk road is?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah, Marco Polo and lots of caravans traveled along it to get silk from China.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That means China was getting lots of valuable things flowing into their country to pay for the silk.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So that made China rich.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;China wisely kept their special silkworms within the Forbidden City to protect their monopoly. Protecting a monopoly through secrecy is an important way for a region or a business to dramatically gain economic prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;The Forbidden City's the fortress where the emp'ror of China lived.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Be the only source of something valuable. That's a monopoly. Got it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Another way to increase prosperity is to increase efficiency.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I need an example again.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Consider the Roman empire. They wrote laws to control business and commerce, including setting standards for weights and sizes. And they used soldiers and courts to enforce those laws. And they built roads and patroled them with soldiers. They built aqueducts to channel water to cities. All of that greatly increased their economic efficiency.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Profit goes up when costs go down. And costs go down when people spend less time fetching water, dismissing door-to-door con artists, getting robbed, breaking cart wheels on bad roads, and getting sick because of not having water to wash their hands.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Got it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Especially important is for there to be less fighting. Not only physical fighting, but fewer business disputes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Since efficiency is so important, economists measure it, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;They think they do. They have something called the productivity index. But it's flawed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus. You do remember some economics. The productivity index is supposed to measure productivity, which is similar to efficiency. Yet that index increases when a house burns down and then gets rebuilt. Of course it would be even more efficient if the house never burned down. But measuring non-destruction isn't something economists think to do.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So if efficiency is what made the Roman empire great, why did it decline? In just a sentence or two.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Careful, the books on this subject could completely fill a small library.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I'll give you just the relevant part. After the years of good governance, when things were prosperous, corruption grew. And corruption reduces efficiency.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Why?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;This is going to take awhile. Wake me when it's over.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Actually it's simple. You know what the free market is, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yeah.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Of course.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;In an ideal free market, there are no barriers. People can choose what to buy, what to sell, how much to charge, and whatever else, without fighting. That's a fluid, flexible, and efficient, economy. But corruption? That puts up barriers that are chosen to channel money into specific pockets. Those barriers reduce efficiency.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Got it. So efficiency and selling what's desirable is what brings money into a region. And corruption reduces efficiency, which causes economic decline.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;In ancient Rome a bigger source of wealth was through conquest. That means stealing. That's what brought lots of wealth into Rome, from other regions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But that ends when there are no more regions to conquer, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, basically that's the kids' book version of the Roman empire. A similar kind of rise and fall pattern happened later with the Italian Renaissance. It started with efficient banking and improved ships using technology from China.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The compass, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And the ship's rudder.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And the digit zero.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;You're astute!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;No my ass didn't toot!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Astute, it means perceptive. It's a big compliment.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Oh thanks! And gunpowder too?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Certainly gunpowder enabled seagoing people to exploit other regions and their resources.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Now that I better understand that transporting manufactured items between Europe and Asia was what big ships were being used for, I realize that running into America and taking land from the natives, and enslaving Africans to work on plantations in the Caribbean, was a bonus. And giving religious folks a place where they could escape competing religions was just, for us, a lucky byproduct?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Basically, yes. And it gave democracy a place to grow, far away from big armies and navies. The resulting cooperation among U.S. states led to immense prosperity. That's why a couple centuries later Europeans formed the European Union. They finally set aside their religious differences, their cultural differences, their language differences, and their racial differences in an effort to copy the cooperation that works so well in the United States.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You said fighting undermines the economy. Yet political hawks, who are mostly conservatives, promote warfare as a way to increase prosperity. And competition between businesses is the basis of prosperity in a free market, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I'm lost. I feel like I'm in a maze and someone turned off the lights.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Competition between businesses provides motivation to work hard. But what gets overlooked is the teamwork, the cooperation, among employees within the same business.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Huh?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, employees getting along, who wouldn't normally get along. Like employees ignoring racial differences, religious differences, and gender differences.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, and Republicans and Democrats ignoring their differences while at work.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;When these conflicts are ignored, that's cooperation. Ah, that increases efficiency <i>within</i> the business.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So cooperation within a business makes the business strong, so it can better compete against other businesses? The lights are coming back on. I think I see.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So fighting between groups of people inspires, motivates, cooperation within each group?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's not a bad simplification.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So a free market is a good thing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A fully free market is impossible, yet it gets tried repeatedly, and it fails, like the Articles of Confederation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Basically the U.S. Constitution is version two point oh. The Articles of Confederation was version one point oh.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It failed partly because it asked each colony to supply soldiers and weapons and such, but there was no negative consequence for the colonies that didn't. So the Constitution, among other changes, taxed the colonies to pay for one big army and navy. That cooperation was the opposite of what European nations were doing, which was fighting each other endlessly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So you're saying that if there was a fully free market then we wouldn't have things like a military.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Or libraries, public schools, food for the poor, hospitals, or foster homes for orphans. Those things were created by churches, and religions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Religion?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Ancient priests in Egypt earned their grain and beer by predicting eclipses so their boss, the pharaoh, could pretend to be powerful. And by predicting when the Nile River would flood and recede. Plus each year priests used mathematics and surveying to lay out the new farming boundaries. All of that was like magic to people who didn't understand astronomy, weather, and geometry.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's why Galileo was a threat to the Catholic Church. He showed that science was better than priests at those things.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And priests lost lots of credibility, plus their lives, during the European black death by praying for the dying. So lots of what was once done by religion has split into science, engineering, and government. Now, the big barrier against progress for civilization is our use of very primitive voting methods.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what would happen if we, the majority of voters, could elect leaders who care? How would those leaders change the U.S. economy? To make it fair. I assume they would increase our efficiency, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes they would want to increase prosperity. As a start, they would avoid making big mistakes other nations have made.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;An example?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;When England was prosperous they raised tariffs as a way to increase their income, or so they thought. But higher tariffs only work if there's a monopoly. That new barrier gave Dutch people a trading advantage, because they had lower tariffs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So higher tariffs on English goods motivated other nations to trade with the Dutch instead of the English? Isn't that when Dutch business owners used their wealth to bid up the price of tulip bulbs to sub-orbital highs?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Indeed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And isn't that when Protestants in England moved to Holland, where the Dutch live, so they could escape religious persecution?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If a free market is so great, why don't we have more of it?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Great question.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A free market saves money for lots of people. But it decreases income for people who cling to outdated ways of doing business. So naturally the wealthy ones pay politicians to keep the status quo.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Status quo ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Means keeping things as they are. I've been doing some reading.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;On the flip side, a free market increases wealth for people who innovate instead of cling.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is this why Amazon does so well? And why retail stores are suffering? Amazon uses computers to replace the inefficiency of people. Like in retail stores where employees stocking shelves get interrupted by customers asking where the restrooms are. And clerks having to count out change when someone hands them cash. And then, looking at the overall economy, driving to stores wastes lots of time and fuel, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;You're getting this! Congratulations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Here in the U.S. we have to buy sugar that's made from sugar cane that's grown in Florida, so we're wasting lots of money that could be spent on other things if we bought our sugar from outside the U.S., right? So we should eliminate monopolies, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Monopolies do reduce economic efficiency. But some monopolies are needed, such as for making strategic things. Like bombs, computers for military use, and <span class="highlight">[???]</span>. Decades ago sugar was regarded as a strategic advantage, that's why it's got a monopoly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Getting fat is a strategic advantage?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Here I'm just talking about economic prosperity, not military defensibility. Or about preparing for emergency situations such as earthquakes and pandemics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So goods and services shouldn't be wasted. That makes sense.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;There's something else that shouldn't be wasted. It's difficult to measure, so it's easily overlooked. Consider what happened in Britain during World War One. It was popular for university-educated men to volunteer to fight in that war.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;They got slaughtered in the trenches. Lots of knowledge and lots of skills died with them. What a waste.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And that caused a bad feedback loop because it reduced the people who could educate the next generation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, so that's why men in college get excluded from the draft. I see. Knowledge and skills are also resources that can get used efficiently or wasted.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Or lost. During the European black death, lots of blacksmiths and ship builders and court jesters died. With them died lots of valuable knowledge.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Jesters were smart?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Back before the iPod and Netflix and radio and even record players, music and jokes and dances could only be heard or seen in the presence of musicians, storytellers, jesters, and dancers. If they died without passing along what they knew, their songs, dances, and hilarious jokes were lost.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, death. It takes so much away.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And in those times horseshoes, swords, and sailing ships were high technology.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So part of why humans haven't recently walked on the moon is because the people who knew how to put them there are dead, or retired.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Right. And the opposite of losing knowledge is gaining knowledge. That increases efficiency. That's what gave strength to the Islamic Golden Age.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's that?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's when Bagdad was the center of an empire of people who spoke Arabic and followed the religion of Islam. A wise ruler, whose name I don't remember ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;... Harun al-Rashid, at the end of the seven hundreds ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;... collected books and gathered wise scholars from around the world, and paid smart people to develop things like algebra, and ..., I forget what else.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Three D drawings, robotic mechanisms, and much more.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Is that when the digit zero made its way closer to Europe?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Yes, and why Europeans and we refer to the digits zero through nine as Arabic numerals.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus plus. And that empire became weak as a result of what?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Corruption I'll bet.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, including a dismissal of science.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;People who dismiss science are so stupid. And I'll bet some of them are capitalists who fail to see that the loss of science leads the economy into a death spiral.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Another bad feedback loop. Got it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That pattern of bad rulers causing unneeded suffering was so well known in China that emperors feared natural disasters. That's because when lots of people died in a flood or crop failure, or pandemic, Chinese people rebeled and claimed the emperor had lost the mandate of heaven. What Europeans call the right to rule.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Too bad those signs are ignored by Congress and U.S. voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Another big loss of efficiency is mismanagement. That's partly why NASA lost its ability to make rockets that can take astronauts to the space station.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And why now NASA has to buy passage for astronauts on Russian rockets.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;On the topic of Russia, socialism is what some folks think would be better than capitalism, but it's not.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I learned that once, but the why part flew out of my head.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's because free markets more quickly arrive at the most efficient networks and interdependencies. But socialism attempts to control markets with quotas, and penalties, and price fixing, from the top down. But those rules can't change as fast as what happens at the bottom of the economy. Plus they do hiring and firing based on nepotism and favoritism, not competence.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What's nepo... whatever.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Hiring family members.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So it's like letting water find its own way to the ocean, instead of trying to redirect rivers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's a useful metaphor. So finally I can answer your main question. The most effective way for a government to increase prosperity is to increase taxes on activities that are wasteful or inefficient. And to decrease taxes on activities that are efficient and bring a net flow of money into the region. In this case the region is the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So which business activities are which?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Let's consider some different kinds of businesses. How about farming?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That brings money in. If the crops are sold outside the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Which is part of why farmers get lots of special government subsidies. How about manufacturing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That brings money in, when the products are sold outside the U.S.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I thought that manufacturing businesses were bad.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;There are some that underpay and mistreat their employees. That was quite common when the industrial revolution began. In the last few decades laws have outlawed the worst pollution abuses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;A business doesn't need to be bad. Got it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Lower taxes for good manufacturing businesses would reward them for efficiently hiring skilled workers who transform raw materials into valuable products worth lots of money.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So software businesses would get lower taxes too? They bring lots of money into the United States from other nations, and they just consume electricity. And they hire highly skilled software developers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Great example. How about mining companies?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;They bring lots of money into the U.S., but doesn't the U.S. lose lots of natural resources that future generations will come to miss?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes. Like Japan, where they cut down their forests for firewood, and so now they buy lots of timber from the U.S. Or did back when lots and lots of logging was done in the Pacific Northwest.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So mining and timber businesses deserve to pay higher taxes, right?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The word <i>deserve</i> is judgemental, so that's a matter of opinion. There might be times when Desha thinks you deserve to be spanked with a wet towel, but that would be a judgement, not a fact. But, yes, if mining and timber industries export lots of materials now, then future generations will not be getting as much income from those sources.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Short-sighted capitalists. Speaking of that, what is capitalism? It's confusing to me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's because the word really has different meanings in different situations. Of course textbooks carefully define it, but those definitions use words that don't fully capture exactly what it means every time it's used.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Which explains why so much of what I learned in school now seems like snow on a hillside that has melted away. Especially compared to this, what you're teaching us.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's a joy to really get to teach what's important! Now, back to what doesn't have an official name. How about artists, writers, composers, and other people who create things that can be sold for way more than the cost of electricity and art supplies and creative software?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Clearly they deserve, er, should get, lower taxes on their businesses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So what's this called? This thing of imposing lower taxes on businesses that efficiently create things of value, and imposing higher taxes on businesses that waste resources or don't attract as much money into the United States?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's an idea still in its infancy so it doesn't have an established name. I've only heard it called <i>tax the takers more than the makers.</i></p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I like that. Those of us who want to make things would work for businesses that are taxed less, so they could pay higher wages because of those lower taxes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And corporations would pay much higher taxes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Only some corporations would pay higher taxes. Other corporations create lots of valuable products and services, and they would pay lower taxes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Which corporations create value? I thought that big corporations are predatory.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The Corporation For Public Broadcasting creates lots of great educational TV shows for kids.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And for adults. Their NOVA shows are great.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Ah, I suppose it's like with rich people. Some are good, and some are bad. I have to pay attention to what they do.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Indeed. And I'll say I'm glad you see that simply taxing wealthy individuals isn't the key.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I learned they can hide fancy cars, yachts, and Florida condos in the businesses and trusts they own. So they can evade individual taxation.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And it's harder to figure out which rich folks deserve to be wealthy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;None of them!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Can you not think of any wealthy people who deserve to earn lots of money for their work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My boss, and other owners of small construction businesses like the one I work in. And maybe Elon Musk because he's making big overdue changes.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;But he's a jerk.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;So was Bill Gates in his early years. But here we're just talking about whether they have done things that strengthen the economy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I think Oprah Winfrey is a good example of someone who deserves her wealth. And Stephen Colbert because he makes me laugh about the craziness in politics.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And they are all in the political up, along with us voters.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It's hard to judge which individuals are in what you call the political up versus down. It's easier to do with businesses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;With individuals we just need to look at how much they give to politicians.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Following the flow of money in politics is like slicing an onion. There are lots of layers to cut through, and the process brings tears to your eyes. It's easier to separate the takers from the makers in businesses. We just look at what the business does.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;There are some kinds of businesses that I'm not sure if they would be takers or makers. It feels like trying to sort sheep while half asleep.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;In general the spectrum from makers to takers would be something like this. It starts with farming and ranching. Then to manufacturing, cooking, brewing, entertaining, engineering, inventing, software developing, oil refining, research if it isn't market research, and other such making activities. Then to teaching and training. Then to healthcare, grocery sales, meat packing, canning, and maintenance. Then to shipping, retail stores, hospitality, and more. Then to advertising and marketing. Then finally to banking, insurance, legal services, real estate developers, logging, mining, casinos, alcohol businesses, and the tobacco industry.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I love it! Especially because those sleazy real estate developers would be at the bottom paying the highest tax rates. Now it's finally so much clearer who I should fight! And how I can fight!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So you're saying that better voting methods would allow us voters to elect politicians who would pass laws that change business taxes? In ways that encourage efficiency? And so there's a big flow of money into the United States?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And less profits for businesses that mostly earn their money from customers inside the U.S.? Like Wall Street and insurance companies?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I'm not saying what should be done, or will be done. I'm saying that economic prosperity would increase if those changes were made.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And it would only decrease prosperity for a few people who earn their money by owning taker businesses? That sounds great!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I'm ready for this fight!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Hey! I see a pattern. The owners of taker businesses are in the political down, and currently their businesses get so many tax breaks that they pay low tax rates. And the owners of maker businesses, like the one I work in and the one I'd like to build, they're in the political up. And they pay high tax rates, and get few tax breaks. The economy is like a bat taking a nap. It's upside down!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Yes! The economic world is so very upside down! It's time to turn the world right side up!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Alas, yes, the economic world is upside down.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I see something else! Suppose Wall Street businesses and law offices were taxed more. Their employees would earn less than they do now. So some smart employees on Wall Street and some smart lawyers would move to software and manufacturing businesses because those businesses would be taxed less, so they could pay better than now. That job migration would increase U.S. prosperity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I see. They would be less attracted to the soul-sucking jobs on Wall Street. But wait a minute. Wouldn't that mean higher taxes on my future business because I'm not a smart guy?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Does this guy really not know how smart he is?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;He hasn't done much reading so he's not book smart. But he's very smart in common sense, which is all too uncommon, alas.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If I'm so smart, why did I flunk out of community college?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Because you've got a reading disability that schools don't test for. That makes schools stupid. Not you.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;My world is so upside down in so many ways.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Let's fix that. What's still confusing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I still don't know why so many people say it's easy to earn lots of money just by working extra hard.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That was true back in the nineteen fifties, sixties, and into the seventies.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What changed?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Remember that a big part of World War Two was the bombing of factories and power plants. That destroyed lots of the efficiency that had been built in industrial nations.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Then why do political hawks promote warfare as if that's a way to increase profits?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Here's a question. Which nations did not get their factories destroyed by bombs?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;The United States.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;And Canada.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That gave the United States and Canada a monopoly. A huge monopoly. What was it?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Factories! Manufacturing! The entire world had to buy manufactured goods from the U.S. and Canada.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Right, so what does that mean?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Huge amounts of money, to buy those goods, flowed into North America.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;And that ended when other nations built new factories to replace the ones that were bombed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's why U.S. economic prosperity peaked in the fifties and sixties. That's when the idea arose, well resurfaced, that anyone could get rich by working hard.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Is that when the middle class grew? And isn't the middle class now disappearing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus again! There's something called the Gini coefficient that measures income inequity.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It measures wickedness? I love it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;You're thinking of iniquity. This is inequity. As in inequality.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;This coefficient started rising in the late nineteen seventies. That's when getting to the middle class became harder.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's when <i>primary</i> elections became common! And that's when the political down increased campaign contributions to candidates in Democratic primaries.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;That's not just a coincidence is it?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Now you're getting to something I don't know.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So rising to the middle class based on hard work is something from the past?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I'm not a political scientist, yet I can see there's lots and lots of corruption in the U.S., and it's been increasing. But please appreciate that most other nations are even more corrupt. And never forget that corruption was worse in the past.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Is there any hope that the big problems we face can be solved? Like global climate change?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Back when horses pulled wagons, big cities faced a big environmental dilemma. They predicted that soon cities would be knee high in horse shit. Yet that didn't happen.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So our current climate crisis is like being ankle-deep in horse shit? Except it's invisible?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;They failed to predict automobiles would take over. So what predictions are we overlooking? Are there solutions that can solve our huge problems?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Perhaps the biggest overlooked solution is pairwise vote counting. Also I've read about fully synthetic hydrocarbon fuel, thorium nuclear reactors, new programming languages that simplify automating things online, a fully phonetic writing system that reduces illiteracy, open patents as an aternative to monopoly patents, dishwasher-sized kitchen appliances that do food prep using robotics controlled by workers in distant countries, and a years-in-prison movie and game rating that would reduce crime. And I've got personal guesses. Eventually there will be better micropayment systems that help individual entrepreneurs. And I'll guess there'll be higher taxes on businesses that have more salary inequity between executives and workers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wow! It makes my gutter cleaning tool seem smaller than a bikini in Rio.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;How do you know about these things?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I read. It's a form of time travel.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I read too, but this is all new to me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;I mostly read non-fiction, and I skip over articles that are judgements, such as who's to blame, or what <i>should</i> be done, or what celebrities are promoting. Instead I read about why things are the way they are, which includes lots of history. And when there's a claim for a solution, I just focus on its advantages and disadvantages.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So what's blocking those future solutions from happening?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Let me guess. Feedback loops are keeping those things from getting developed.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;A plus again!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So there are lots of feedback loops blocking progress. What's the feedback loop that blocks us from election reform?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;There are many. As you've discovered, vote splitting is just one part of a feedback loop that keeps owners of political-down businesses in political power where they can oppose solutions such as fully synthetic hydrocarbon fuel.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;What's synthetic whatever?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Fully synthetic hydrocarbon fuel refers to gases and liquids that are chemically manufactured. The process would use sunlight as the energy source. It would get carbon from carbon dioxide in the atmosphere ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Which we have too much of.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;... and it gets hydrogen from water.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So doing what plants do?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, but much more efficiently. Especially compared to using crops to generate ethanol, which involves a few wealthy people who have a monopoly on ethanol.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If synthetic hydro ...</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Fully synthetic hydrocarbon fuel</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;... is such a good thing, what's blocking that from happening?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;There's no economic incentive. The people who have the skills to figure it out cannot get paid to do that research.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, another feedback loop. So, is there something from history that would reveal how to accelerate good changes?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;When Kodak tried to develop, so to speak, color film for cameras, their research labs were only making slow progress. But two young chemistry graduates were making better progress, so Kodak hired them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What was the secret that gave them an advantage?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;They were singers.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The secret was singing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;At that time color darkrooms were completely dark, so there was no way to see a timer. Yet the chemistry was very time-critical. So they sang songs together and used the timing of songs as their timer for chemical reactions.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;So you're saying we need to take up singing?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It illustrates that breakthroughs often require sub-breakthroughs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So this means we need to figure out some kind of innovation that will help spread the bigger innovation of fairer voting methods?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes. Look for a way to break the feedback loops that block fairer voting. Drill a hole through the dam that holds back the flood of fairness that civilization is waiting for. Then voters can elect leaders who will be <i>their</i> puppets. Until then politicians are the puppets of the biggest campaign contributors.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Any more tips?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;One way to fight against bad feedback loops is to create opposing good feedback loops. For example, dictatorships have fallen after democracy demonstrated better economic prosperity. That's what brought down the Berlin wall, toppled the dictators in eastern Europe, and ended the Cold War against the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Wow!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So feedback loops are not always bad?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Good and bad are just shortcut ways to say that something has lots of advantages or lots of disadvantages. But it depends on who you are as to whether a change is an advantage or disadvantage. A feedback loop that helps rich folks get richer is good for those rich folks, but bad for their customers, their employees.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, this is the cherry pie slicing concept.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And it can be both good and bad. Like when those customers and employees don't have enough money to boost the price of shares that rich shareholders want to sell.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's bad for the rich owners when they want to cash in their shares, and yet good for them 'cause those shares are worth more 'cause worker salaries are lower. Wow, so many feedback loops.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Your insights are amazing.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But my head is full!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;To help you see how it all fits together, here's a thought. Voting, and taxes, and subsidies, and legal monopolies, and even jail time, are all forms of communication.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I can see that voters try to use their ballot to say we want more of this, and less of that. Alas, it's still at the mumbling stage of communication. But taxes, how is that communication?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;I see! It's a way government can use tax breaks to say we want more farming, more military strength, and emergency supplies. And higher taxes can say we need fewer pirates on Wall Street, and fewer businesses that overpay executives while underpaying workers. And Wall Street executives never going to jail sends a clear message that financial corruption is tolerated.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Now it makes sense. Now hopefully I can better figure out how to earn money as an entrepreneur.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;To do that you need to understand another concept. So here's a test you'll probably fail, but it exercises your brain. What do these people have in common? Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Elon Musk, Thomas Edison, George Westinghouse, and Giovanni Marconi.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;They are, or were, rich entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And what else?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;The got rich through tech. Technology.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And what else?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's all my brain can guess.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;This isn't something I ever learned.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;They profited from technology that was created by creative geniuses.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah yes. Steve Jobs co-founded Apple with another guy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Steve Wozniak, who designed and built the circuit board for what could have been called the Apple One. And Apple hired Jony Ive who was a design genius.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Bill Gates co-founded Microsoft with another guy.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, Paul Allen. Yet also they bought code and renamed it Microsoft DOS. So there were lots of creative geniuses behind Microsoft Windows.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Elon Musk has hired lots and lots of really smart engineers and software coders.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;And now the trick question. Who are the creative geniuses who created amazing technology breakthroughs for Thomas Edison, and George Westinghouse, and Giovanni Marconi?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I only know one of those. Nikola Tesla. He helped Westinghouse with electrical power stuff.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Indeed, he almost single-handedly designed our power grid system. Yet he also designed key parts of radio technology that Marconi commercialized. And Tesla also did some inventing for Thomas Edison.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;So why doesn't history teach more about people like Tesla?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Who has money to hire artists to paint portraits and cast statues and write books? The leaders who win battles.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;The people who do the work get left out. Both from profits and historical recognition.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's why I said the important part of history is understanding cause and effect. And now do you see what you should know about entrepreneurs?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;It's the creative geniuses who create things of value that entrepreneurs sell.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes! And those creators create the innovations that keep the business ahead of copycat businesses. That's another form of monopoly. Especially if competing businesses don't have creative geniuses working for them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Ah, the legal and ethical kind of monopoly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Maybe now you can figure out how you can make money from your invention. Maybe by teaming up with an entrepreneur. You would be the creative genius.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If I could get a patent.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;It takes lots of money to protect a patent.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;I thought getting a patent was the hard part.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;That's just a start. If it's a great idea other businesses will infringe on your patent. So you have to take them to court to protect your monopoly.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That sucks. Is there a way to ..., I don't know, to win in the business world?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;The open patent I mentioned would help.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;How does that work?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;If it existed you could afford to register your idea with the patent office. They would give you a patent number. You'd add it to your LinkedIn profile. And then corporations would recognize your ability to invent useful things. That would earn you a very nice salary.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;But it doesn't yet exist. So what should I do?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's a huge inefficiency in the economy. Currently corporations don't know how to hire, or even recognize, creative geniuses. Until after they've been the co-founder of a wildly successful start up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;That's a huge wall to climb.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Yes, alas, under current conditions only hindsight reveals who's a creative genius. When that inefficiency gets solved, that will increase economic prosperity so dramatically that it will change the economy from a roller coaster ride into a rocket ship blasting into outer space.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Is there any hope?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Indeed, all of the inefficiencies in the economy can disappear after we adopt better laws. But that requires better vote counting methods.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Wow! Now my head's so full it feels ready to become a fireworks display.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Professor Pengaritihas we're so grateful you've given us so much wisdom.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Ah, if only more people were anxious to learn like you two are.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;What a pleasure! So how can we repay you?</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Make the world a better place for my grandchildren. And get it right! Less corruption would help nearly everyone. And the few who lose will still have their huge bank accounts, so they and their families will not suffer. And then it will spread to other countries around the world where suffering is even worse. And that will help the children of my nieces and nephews. They live in India. In advance thank you for helping them.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;We will fight for what is right.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Yes we'll do our very best to turn the worlds of politics and economics rightside up.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;This was well worth the four-hour drive to come meet with you.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singername">Pengaritihas:</span>&#160;Good luck! You'll need it. And remember that you didn't learn any of this from me.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;We know how this works, so we promise!</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainmale">Damien:</span>&#160;Thanks for the master class in restoring the middle class. And Desha, let's talk this stuff over on the ride back home, shall we? So we can remember it.</p>
<p class="lyric"><span class="singermainfemale">Desha:</span>&#160;Of course! What else would we want to talk about?</p>
