Surely some folks

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yes, there are some

their profits reduced

And because of

Did you know

we pay lots more

Sixteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The price within

the U.S. is the

sentence-next
o-o
The people

that legal

end-lyric

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Indeed!
sentence-next
o-o
Your business

taxes would

sentence-next
o-o
'N you deserve
o-o
that 'cause
o-o
mostly
o-o
what you do is

buy land,

election

to control
o-o
city councils
o-o
to change the

the buildings

at inflated prices.
sentence-next
o-o
And doing all that
o-o
doesn't require
o-o
brains,
o-o
just
o-o
immorality.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
That's completely
o-o
legal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes because you control

elected city

o-o
who write the laws.
end-lyric

I really want to know.
sentence-next
o-o
Would taxes increase

Some would pay lower

taxes, and others

taxes.
end-lyric

That's not specific.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Businesses that

Businesses that

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That's still not

specific.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Developers like you
o-o
would pay higher

taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
On what basis?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You do not bring

end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
On the contrary!
sentence-next
o-o
People from elsewhere

o-o
And they bring

their wealth
o-o
into the local

economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That brings

money to you,

traffic, and
o-o
increases
o-o
infrastructure
o-o
costs to those of us
o-o
already here.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And it pushes up

the cost of

people into

homelessness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Plus your business

end-lyric

Tell me which kinds

and such.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They get lower taxes?
sentence-next
o-o
Why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because they

bring a net flow

o-o
the city
o-o

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You said non hyphen-here chain
o-o
restaurants.
sentence-next
o-o
Why not chain
o-o
restaurants?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They send lots
o-o
of their profits
o-o
to corporate

o-o
which drains

money from
o-o
the city and
o-o
state where the

o-o
located.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And nobody

drives to a city

end-lyric

My business

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Exactly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
So it taxes the sinners

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a useful

way to view it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I like it!

Even though

it might offend
o-o
many of the

Yet we do

exploitation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So the

different

tax rates are
o-o
like the

difference
o-o
between a

word-resume

eulogy.
sentence-next
o-o
A word-resume

a eulogy

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Interesting
o-o
distinction!
sentence-next
o-o
What I've accomplished

But now it's time

might be said

in my eulogy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I don't see the
o-o
difference.
sentence-next
o-o
But then religion

isn't my thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lately, with the

worlds of business

o-o
declining

o-o
we the voters

for fairness!
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
So is fairness

or money more

important to

you?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why can't we

get both?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Getting to the

maybe a few

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to build

a business that

sentence-next
o-o
My original
o-o
plan was to

manufacture
o-o
my leaf gutter
o-o
cleaning tool
o-o
so that fewer
o-o
people fall off
o-o
ladders
o-o
when cleaning their

sentence-next
o-o
Yet lately,

other inventions

someone told us

about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Your mind is in

o-o
None of that

end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Mmm, I'm
o-o
beginning
o-o
to see the
o-o
value of
o-o
creating
o-o
that kind of
o-o
business
o-o
if it gets
o-o
taxed less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And fewer toes
o-o
would get
o-o
stepped on.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And fewer fingers
o-o
would get cut
o-o
doing food prep.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As a
o-o
bachelor,
o-o
a kitchen
o-o
food prep machine
o-o
sounds like
o-o
maybe a good
o-o
alternative
o-o
to getting
o-o
so much takeout
o-o
delivered.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I admit
o-o
a food prep
o-o
appliance
o-o
would reduce
o-o
labor costs
o-o
for my favorite
o-o
restaurants,
o-o
so maybe
o-o
that would make
o-o
dining out
o-o
cost less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yet another
o-o
benefit of
o-o
taxing takers
o-o
more than makers
o-o
is that very smart
o-o
well hyphen-here educated
o-o
people would be less
o-o
attracted to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking

banks and

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
