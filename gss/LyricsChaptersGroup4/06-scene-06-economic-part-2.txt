Ancient priests

Indeed,

o-o
stupidity
o-o
is tricky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Speaking of
o-o
morons,
o-o
why doesn't
o-o
the economy
o-o
work for
o-o
hard workers
o-o
like me?
sentence-next
o-o
The numbers lie.
sentence-next
o-o
They say
o-o
everything's
o-o
hunky dory.
sentence-next
o-o
Is this an example
o-o
of mathiness?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
I don't know what
o-o
mathiness is.
sentence-next
o-o
But numbers can
o-o
be deceptive.
sentence-next
o-o
What many people
o-o
overlook is that
o-o
the unemployment
o-o
rate that's in the news
o-o
just counts people
o-o
who are now getting
o-o
unemployment
o-o
benefits.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Those benefits
o-o
run out after a
o-o
few months of having
o-o
no job. I've learned
o-o
that from
o-o
experience.
sentence-next
o-o
So unemployment
o-o
is actually higher,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes, it's higher.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why don't economists
o-o
measure that?
sentence-next
o-o
The real unemployment
o-o
rate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The government
o-o
does measure that
o-o
as well.
sentence-next
o-o
But most
o-o
newspapers and
o-o
TV stations
o-o
report the
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate
o-o
that
o-o
government
o-o
officials call
o-o
attention to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Since wealthy
o-o
business owners
o-o
own news sources,
o-o
they probably
o-o
tell their
o-o
reporters
o-o
to report the
o-o
lower rate.
sentence-next
o-o
That gives
o-o
consumers
o-o
the confidence
o-o
to spend dollars
o-o
more freely.
sentence-next
o-o
And that gives
o-o
the wealthy
o-o
more sales,
o-o
more money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought it was
o-o
just the
o-o
government
o-o
being sneaky.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's both.
sentence-next
o-o
The government
o-o
knows that if they
o-o
call attention
o-o
to the higher
o-o
actual
o-o
unemployment
o-o
rate,
o-o
then consumers
o-o
will have less
o-o
optimism.
sentence-next
o-o
And when there's
o-o
less optimism
o-o
consumers
o-o
spend less money,
o-o
and that loops
o-o
back through
o-o
businesses
o-o
to fewer jobs
o-o
and lower
o-o
salaries
o-o
for other
o-o
employees,
o-o
who then spend
o-o
less money.
sentence-next
o-o
That's a powerful
o-o
feedback loop.
