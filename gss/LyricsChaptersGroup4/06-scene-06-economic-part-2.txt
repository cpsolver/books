Do you know what
o-o
the silk road was?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
Marco Polo
o-o
and lots of
o-o
caravans
o-o
traveled along
o-o
it to get silk
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
China was getting
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
things flowing
o-o
into their country
o-o
to pay for the silk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that made
o-o
China rich?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Enormously
o-o
wealthy.
sentence-next
o-o
Well,
o-o
at least for those
o-o
living in
o-o
and near
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City.
sentence-next
o-o
And instead of
o-o
just selling
o-o
spools of silk,
o-o
they wove it into
o-o
begin-italics beautiful end-italics
o-o
fabric
o-o
that was worth
o-o
more than
o-o
its weight
o-o
in gold.
sentence-next
o-o
And they wisely
o-o
kept their special
o-o
silkworms within
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City to
o-o
protect their
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Forbidden
o-o
City's the
o-o
fortress where
o-o
the emperor
o-o
of China
o-o
lived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
With his
o-o
harem,
o-o
I presume.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That monopoly
o-o
lasted for
o-o
centuries.
sentence-next
o-o
So they aren't
o-o
always blips
o-o
in time.
sentence-next
o-o
Also the
o-o
Arabic hyphen-here speaking
o-o
traders
o-o
along the
o-o
middle eastern
o-o
part of the
o-o
silk road
o-o
monopolized
o-o
access
o-o
to that silk,
o-o
and that trade
o-o
monopoly
o-o
also lasted
o-o
for centuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Portuguese
o-o
ships
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Brazil,
o-o
and then
o-o
Columbus
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Caribbean

sentence-next
o-o
They were looking
o-o
for an
o-o
alternate route
o-o
to China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK,
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are not always
o-o
short blips.
sentence-next
o-o
And I see
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are good for
o-o
sellers
o-o
but bad for
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
But how does that
o-o
affect today's
o-o
economy?
sentence-next
o-o
It seems like
o-o
rising to
o-o
the middle class
o-o
based on hard work
o-o
is something
o-o
from the past,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not that
o-o
simple.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you know
o-o
about inflation?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah!
sentence-next
o-o
The cost of
o-o
rent 'n food
o-o
'n ice cream
o-o
are going up
o-o
and up fast
o-o
while salaries
o-o
suck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
my salary
o-o
stays stuck.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
reasons why
o-o
the cost of living
o-o
is going up
o-o
faster than
o-o
the consumer
o-o
price index,
o-o
which is the
o-o
official
o-o
measurement
o-o
of inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I remember
o-o
that number
o-o
is flawed
o-o
a bit,
o-o
but I forgot
o-o
why it's full of
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Part of the why
o-o
is because
o-o
back when the price
o-o
of food items
o-o
were quickly
o-o
rising,
o-o
some food items
o-o
were replaced by
o-o
items whose cost
o-o
were declining.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's declining
o-o
in cost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The per hyphen-here pixel cost
o-o
of digital
o-o
cameras.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize
o-o
that word begin-italics per end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
It means division.
sentence-next
o-o
And the number
o-o
of pixels in
o-o
a camera
o-o
are going up,
o-o
so dividing by
o-o
that bigger number
o-o
makes the result
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The
o-o
government
o-o
is hiding the real
o-o
cost of living!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why
o-o
are they
o-o
lying?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The consumer
o-o
price index
o-o
is linked to
o-o
such things as
o-o
retirement
o-o
pensions for
o-o
government
o-o
employees,
o-o
and social
o-o
security
o-o
benefits,
o-o
and the
o-o
interest
o-o
the government
o-o
pays for
o-o
borrowed
o-o
money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the government
o-o
basically
o-o
uses tricks
o-o
to pretend
o-o
inflation
o-o
is low,
o-o
so it pays out
o-o
less money,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The word begin-italics tricks end-italics
o-o
is a bit
o-o
unfair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We can't
o-o
call it
o-o
what it is,
o-o
which is
o-o
lying and
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
Shall we

call it
o-o

Or the

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's not.

o-o
Already I'm

sentence-next
o-o
Instead I'm

simplifying

by talking about

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No wonder

school is so

distasteful.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm glad we're

not getting

the common

version.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Getting back to
o-o
the consumer

price index,
o-o
it excludes

o-o
in a way that's

ambee sings-damien amenn
Home

Inflation

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
name-desha no-space ,
o-o
do you
o-o
remember from
o-o
econ one oh one
o-o
what determines

interest rates?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The federal
o-o
reserve chooses
o-o
when to increase

and decrease the
o-o
interest rate,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's the rate
o-o
talked about
o-o
in the news.
sentence-next
o-o
But more important
o-o
is the rate
o-o
determined by
o-o
auctioning
o-o
treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Auctions,
o-o
that means
o-o
sold to the
o-o
highest bidder,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yes.
o-o
But I don't
o-o
remember
o-o
learning about
o-o
those
o-o
auctions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not taught to
o-o
undergrads.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll bet textbooks
o-o
don't include it
o-o
because schools
o-o
are funded by
o-o
the government.
sentence-next
o-o
So textbooks can't
o-o
reveal secrets
o-o
the government
o-o
wants to hide.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In economically
o-o
optimistic
o-o
times
o-o
those auctioned
o-o
U.S.
o-o
treasuries
o-o
sell for
o-o
higher prices,
o-o
closer to the

amount the

government pays
o-o
when they reach their

redemption date.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, but in
o-o
economically
o-o
pessimistic
o-o
times the buyers
o-o
pay much less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
then the gap
o-o
between
o-o
purchase price
o-o
and redemption

payment

increases.

o-o
So that

of interest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Optimism?

o-o
Pessimism?
sentence-next
o-o
Feelings matter?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You buy more stuff,

at higher prices,

when you're

less afraid

of the future.
sentence-next
o-o
Like during

o-o
Economists

measure
o-o
those feelings,

to predict

the future.

You've heard of the

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm a consumer,

o-o
In the future.

And at the moment

something makes

no sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Interest rates
o-o
have been low

sentence-next

things?

ambee sings-desha amenn
Treasuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes, normally.
sentence-next
o-o
But years ago
o-o
China and

buying them.

So lately the

lots of them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm even
o-o
more confused.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The government
o-o
buying its own

that makes

It would be like

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's partly

why the deficit

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
so the U.S.
o-o
government has

increased its debt

economically?
end-lyric

Wait a moment.

Our economy's

like a stack of

that's ready to

fall?

o-o
Except that

o-o
instead of

just shame?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
All nations

So are farmers.

They all have to

grow crops or

manufacture

get income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So being in debt

isn't a big deal,

but a growing

debt, that's
o-o
disastrous,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Relatively
o-o
speaking, yes.
sentence-next
o-o
But as long as

problems can be

The number of

Consider the

Roman empire.
sentence-next
o-o
They wrote laws

to control

commerce.
sentence-next
o-o
And they used

inspectors
o-o
and courts
o-o
to enforce

those laws.
sentence-next
o-o
An especially
o-o
important
o-o
innovation
o-o
was to set

standards for

weights and sizes.
sentence-next
o-o
And they built roads

and patrolled them

with soldiers.
sentence-next
o-o
They built aqueducts

efficiency?

Ah,

costs went down

better roads.

And there was

less cheating.
sentence-next
o-o
Those inspectors,

merchants

didn't use

lighter weights

That was a big
