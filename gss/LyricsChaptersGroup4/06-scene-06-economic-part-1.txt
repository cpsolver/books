end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn

o-o
Welcome to my

classroom.
sentence-next
o-o
Would you like some

pistachios?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm so
o-o
full of nuts
o-o
I could get a

We're wired on

espresso.
sentence-next
o-o
So let's go!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm hungry
o-o
to learn.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
We came to learn
o-o
the dark arts
o-o
of economics.

Please tell us
o-o
what will happen
o-o
in the world
o-o
of money
o-o
when elections
o-o
are fair.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
When vote splittin's
o-o
no longer
o-o
skewing
o-o
the outcome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
It's not goat
o-o
spitting.
sentence-next
o-o
It's vote
o-o
splitting.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
We know it's
o-o
super
o-o
challengin'
o-o
to predict
o-o
the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's mostly what
o-o
us economists
o-o
are paid to do.
sentence-next
o-o
Predict the future.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Are they,
o-o
well you too,
o-o
in hindsight,
o-o
usually right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Sometimes yes,
o-o
and then we
o-o
use that to
o-o
rise up in our
o-o
hierarchy,
o-o
our academic
o-o
game of thrones,
o-o
such as getting
o-o
tenure.
sentence-next
o-o
Sometimes no,
o-o
and then we
o-o
apply for a
o-o
research grant
o-o
to study why
o-o
we were wrong.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So you get paid more
o-o
if you're wrong?
sentence-next
o-o
Do you own

a Tesla
o-o
and a home

name-desha no-space ,
o-o
your espresso

sentence-next
o-o
Professor,
o-o
do you have a
o-o
general notion
o-o
'bout what will
o-o
change?
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
in Washington.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course!
sentence-next
o-o
New laws
o-o
will outlaw
o-o
lots of
o-o
corruption
o-o
that blocks
o-o
widespread
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
sentence-next
o-o
And tax changes
o-o
and other
o-o
new laws
o-o
will
o-o
unblock
o-o
overdue
o-o
innovations,
o-o
which will
o-o
dramatically
o-o
increase
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
for the regions
o-o
where those reforms
o-o
are adopted.
sentence-next
o-o
You're aware
o-o
there's lots of
o-o
corruption,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Oh yes!
sentence-next
o-o
That's
o-o
why we're here.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's your
o-o
justification?
sentence-next
o-o
For that prediction?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That trend has been
o-o
going on throughout
o-o
civilization
o-o
and history.
sentence-next
o-o
Not counting
o-o
setbacks
o-o
caused by
o-o
large hyphen-here scale
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
especially
o-o
civil war
o-o
and
o-o
international
o-o
warfare.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can you
o-o
explain why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Imagine the economy
o-o
as a strawberry pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm not fond of
o-o
strawberry pie.
sentence-next
o-o
And apple pie
o-o
is tasteless
o-o
to me as a
o-o
metaphor.
sentence-next
o-o
Can we make it
o-o
tastier
o-o
and fill it
o-o
with cherries?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Of course. Now
o-o
imagine the economy
o-o
is a cherry pie.
sentence-next
o-o
If some people
o-o
cut themselves
o-o
a slice that is
o-o
too big, then other
o-o
people end up with
o-o
smaller slices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm following this.
sentence-next
o-o
Wow!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What would you like
o-o
to call the people
o-o
who take too big
o-o
of a slice?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
People in the
o-o
political down.
sentence-next
o-o
As opposed to the
o-o
political left
o-o
'n political
o-o
right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
'N we
o-o
the people,
o-o
who get too little,
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Bravo!
sentence-next
o-o
I'll bet you
o-o
had to struggle
o-o
to get your
o-o
bearings
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
jungle.
sentence-next
o-o
So,
o-o
the way I see it,
o-o
if elections
o-o
were fair,
o-o
then elected
o-o
leaders
o-o
would care
o-o
more about
o-o
the people
o-o
you call the
o-o
political
o-o
up,
o-o
where most
o-o
of us are,
o-o
who get too little
o-o
economic
o-o
pie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the part
o-o
we've figured
o-o
out.
sentence-next
o-o
And that
o-o
replacement
o-o
politicians
o-o
wouldn't lie
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
as much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Only some
o-o
politicians
o-o
will be replaced.
sentence-next
o-o
Other politicians
o-o
will get re hyphen-here elected
o-o
because they will
o-o
shift their
o-o
priorities
o-o
to better match
o-o
voters.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Makes sense.
sentence-next
o-o
Currently
o-o
they're
o-o
handcuffed
o-o
by their
o-o
biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
sentence-next
o-o
The shift will
o-o
set them free
o-o
to do what we,
o-o
the majority
o-o
of voters want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Of course some
o-o
politicians
o-o
lack souls,
o-o
and they'll
o-o
persist
o-o
in being
o-o
ass ...,
o-o
er,
o-o
jerks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And remember
o-o
those tax changes
o-o
and other laws
o-o
I mentioned.
o-o
Those will do
o-o
what amounts to
o-o
creating
o-o
more
o-o
cherry pies.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'd jump to
o-o
the second
o-o
and third pies
o-o
right away.
sentence-next
o-o
And I have to say,
o-o
so far
o-o
this is
o-o
easier
o-o
than playing
o-o
air guitar.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
When I took
o-o
economics
o-o
one oh one,
o-o
it wasn't
o-o
this fun.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
We'll get to some
o-o
complicated
o-o
bits swiftly,
o-o
and they involve
o-o
bits of
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh dear,
o-o
not silly
o-o
wonky
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
I learned some.
sentence-next
o-o
But I'm done
o-o
with the past.
sentence-next
o-o
It's gone.
sentence-next
o-o
Why do people
o-o
dwell on that
o-o
old stuffy
o-o
stuff?
sentence-next
o-o
Other than
o-o
using it
o-o
to play
o-o
trivia
o-o
games.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Here I'm walking
o-o
backwards.
sentence-next
o-o
Imagine that
o-o
this is like
o-o
moving forward
o-o
in time.
sentence-next
o-o
The future
o-o
is behind me
o-o
where I
o-o
cannot see.
sentence-next
o-o
So I look
o-o
where I've been.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the past.
sentence-next
o-o
The patterns
o-o
give me clues
o-o
about
o-o
that which is
o-o
yet to be.
sentence-next
o-o
So history
o-o
is like a
o-o
crystal ball.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I see!
sentence-next
o-o
History
o-o
is a preview
o-o
of the future.
sentence-next
o-o
Who knew?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Probably
o-o
whoever
o-o
said
o-o
history
o-o
doesn't always
o-o
repeat itself,
o-o
but usually
o-o
it rhymes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Many people
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
think history
o-o
is mostly
o-o
recalling
o-o
facts about
o-o
the past.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
In a history
o-o
trivia contest
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would beat me
o-o
like the loudest
o-o
drum in a
o-o
marchin' band.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
would be
o-o
a great way
o-o
to learn
o-o
history.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wikipedia is wrong
o-o
lots of the time.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
About topics
o-o
that affect
o-o
people's
o-o
finances,
o-o
sure.
sentence-next
o-o
But Wikipedia
o-o
is usually
o-o
right about
o-o
non hyphen-here recent
o-o
history.
sentence-next
o-o
Also about
o-o
non hyphen-here medical
o-o
biochemistry,
o-o
basic
o-o
mathematics,
o-o
and movie plots.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My eyes are
o-o
cryin'
o-o
just thinkin'
o-o
about reading
o-o
Wikipedia
o-o
so much.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
You said that
o-o
reading glasses
o-o
with a blue tint
o-o
helps with books.
sentence-next
o-o
A good browser
o-o
can change
o-o
Wikipedia's
o-o
white background
o-o
to blue.
sentence-next
o-o
See how that looks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'll give that
o-o
trick a try.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Rather than facts,
o-o
what's more useful
o-o
regarding
o-o
history
o-o
is causation.
sentence-next
o-o
Cause and effect.
sentence-next
o-o
And the ones
o-o
that involve
o-o
a surprise
o-o
are the insights
o-o
you should
o-o
prize.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Can ya translate
o-o
that into a
o-o
for instance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Let's start with the
o-o
nineteen fifties
o-o
and nineteen sixties
o-o
and into the
o-o
nineteen seventies.
sentence-next
o-o
Why was the
o-o
U.S.
o-o
economy
o-o
so
o-o
prosperous?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That was before
o-o
my time so
o-o
I don't know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This has to do
o-o
with World War Two,
o-o
doesn't it?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
That war happened
o-o
back in, ...
sentence-next
o-o
well it ended in
o-o
nineteen forty five.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Well,
o-o
the
o-o
boomer babies
o-o
were born
o-o
and raised.
sentence-next
o-o
That
o-o
increased
o-o
consumption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I wasn't around,
o-o
so I don't know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Does this have
o-o
anything to do with
o-o
not getting bombed
o-o
here in the U.S.?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Except at Pearl
o-o
Harbor.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
Factories
o-o
and power plants
o-o
throughout
o-o
the world
o-o
were bombed,
o-o
except in
o-o
the United States,
o-o
Canada,
o-o
and less hyphen-here accessible
o-o
parts of
o-o
Russia.
sentence-next
o-o
Why was that
o-o
noteworthy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Anyone who wanted
o-o
a factory job
o-o
could get one?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes.
sentence-next
o-o
What else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Didn't factory jobs
o-o
pay well back then?
sentence-next
o-o
Well enough
o-o
to buy a house?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Yes,
o-o
and what else?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I don't feel
o-o
brainy,
o-o
'cause I don't
o-o
see where
o-o
you're going.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
What's that called
o-o
when there is only
o-o
one place that sells
o-o
what people
o-o
want to buy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
a monopoly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Exactly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Oh yeah,
o-o
the entire world
o-o
had to buy
o-o
manufactured
o-o
goods
o-o
from the U.S.
o-o
and Canada
o-o
and Russia.
sentence-next
o-o
Because other
o-o
factories
o-o
on the planet
o-o
had become
o-o
dinosaurs,
o-o
wiped out by
o-o
bombs instead
o-o
of an
o-o
asteroid.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And when there's
o-o
a monopoly
o-o
the seller
o-o
can sell
o-o
at high prices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And that big
o-o
flow of money
o-o
to factories
o-o
meant higher
o-o
wages.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Great thinking!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wait a minute!
sentence-next
o-o
Is that
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity 
o-o
what voters
o-o
think of
o-o
when they hear
o-o
the slogan
o-o
about making
o-o
America
o-o
great again?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So this is why
o-o
the reverse hyphen-here raccoon hyphen-here eyed guy
o-o
with the never hyphen-here changing tie
o-o
got so many votes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But he blames
o-o
immigrants
o-o
and blacks
o-o
and women
o-o
for the bad
o-o
economy
o-o
we have now.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
As the son of
o-o
an immigrant
o-o
family,
o-o
from India,
o-o
I too think
o-o
that's ironic.
sentence-next
o-o
Even worse,
o-o
for voters,
o-o
it's foolish
o-o
to think
o-o
we can regain
o-o
that prior
o-o
prosperity
o-o
by building
o-o
factories.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you see why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The monopoly
o-o
ended.
sentence-next
o-o
Other nations
o-o
built new
o-o
factories.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A plus!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Does this mean
o-o
the belief
o-o
that anyone
o-o
can get rich by
o-o
working hard
o-o
has reached
o-o
its expiration
o-o
date?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
History
o-o
reveals
o-o
that prosperity
o-o
happens when a
o-o
city, nation,
o-o
or region
o-o
sells something
o-o
that people outside
o-o
the region
o-o
either need or
o-o
strongly desire.
sentence-next
o-o
And it's not
o-o
available from
o-o
anywhere else.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are just
o-o
short blips
o-o
that pass
o-o
like fads,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Do you know what
o-o
the silk road was?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
Marco Polo
o-o
and lots of
o-o
caravans
o-o
traveled along
o-o
it to get silk
o-o
from China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That means
o-o
China was getting
o-o
lots of valuable
o-o
things flowing
o-o
into their country
o-o
to pay for the silk.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So that made
o-o
China rich?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Enormously
o-o
wealthy.
sentence-next
o-o
Well,
o-o
at least for those
o-o
living in
o-o
and near
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City.
sentence-next
o-o
And instead of
o-o
just selling
o-o
spools of silk,
o-o
they wove it into
o-o
begin-italics beautiful end-italics
o-o
fabric
o-o
that was worth
o-o
more than
o-o
its weight
o-o
in gold.
sentence-next
o-o
And they wisely
o-o
kept their special
o-o
silkworms within
o-o
the Forbidden
o-o
City to
o-o
protect their
o-o
monopoly.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The Forbidden
o-o
City's the
o-o
fortress where
o-o
the emperor
o-o
of China
o-o
lived.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
With his
o-o
harem,
o-o
I presume.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That monopoly
o-o
lasted for
o-o
centuries.
sentence-next
o-o
So they aren't
o-o
always blips
o-o
in time.
sentence-next
o-o
Also the
o-o
Arabic hyphen-here speaking
o-o
traders
o-o
along the
o-o
middle eastern
o-o
part of the
o-o
silk road
o-o
monopolized
o-o
access
o-o
to that silk,
o-o
and that trade
o-o
monopoly
o-o
also lasted
o-o
for centuries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's why
o-o
Portuguese
o-o
ships
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Brazil,
o-o
and then
o-o
Columbus
o-o
bumped into
o-o
Caribbean
o-o
Islands.
sentence-next
o-o
They were looking
o-o
for an
o-o
alternate route
o-o
to China.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
OK,
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are not always
o-o
short blips.
sentence-next
o-o
And I see
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are good for
o-o
sellers
o-o
but bad for
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
But how does that
o-o
affect today's
o-o
economy?
sentence-next
o-o
It seems like
o-o
rising to
o-o
the middle class
o-o
based on hard work
o-o
is something
o-o
from the past,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Yeah,
o-o
my salary

end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
There are
o-o
reasons why
o-o
the cost of living
o-o
is going up
o-o
faster than
o-o
the consumer

price index,
o-o
which is the

measurement

of inflation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I remember
o-o
that number

o-o
why it's full of
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Part of the why
o-o
is because
o-o
back when the price
o-o
of food items
o-o
were quickly
o-o
rising,
o-o
some food items
o-o
were replaced by
o-o
items whose cost
o-o
were declining.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's declining
o-o
in cost?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The per hyphen-here pixel cost
o-o
of digital

cameras.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I recognize
o-o
that word begin-italics per end-italics no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
It means division.
sentence-next
o-o
And the number
o-o
of pixels in
o-o
a camera
o-o
are going up,
o-o
so dividing by
o-o
that bigger number
o-o
makes the result
o-o
go down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The
o-o
government
o-o

cost of living!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why
o-o
are they
o-o
lying?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
The consumer

such things as

retirement

pensions for

basically

less money,

right?

That's the rate

Yes.

It's not taught to

end-lyric

I'll bet textbooks

the government

nepotism,

conflicts

racketeering,

black markets,
o-o
inept

bureaucracy,

basing

the economy

on trading favors,

and murdering

political enemies.
sentence-next
o-o
Those corrupt

barriers

efficiency.

What's
o-o
nepo...
sentence-next
o-o
whatever.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Nepotism
o-o
is hiring
o-o
family

members.
sentence-next
o-o
And friends.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So looking
o-o
at Facebook
o-o
friends as
o-o
job candidates
o-o
isn't allowed.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm glad of that.
sentence-next
o-o
But is there really
o-o
less beer drinking
o-o
in frat houses
o-o
compared to
o-o
the past?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not that kind of
o-o
fraternal
o-o
organization.
sentence-next
o-o
I'll explain that
o-o
later.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Also explain
o-o
later about
o-o
trading favors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That part I don't
o-o
understand
o-o
myself.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Trading favors
o-o
is what they do
o-o
in places like
o-o
Russia
o-o
where the
o-o
rule of law
o-o
doesn't
o-o
always rule.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Thank goodness
o-o
the rule of law
o-o
mostly
o-o
still works here,
o-o
even in
o-o
New Jersey.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
On weekdays.
sentence-next
o-o
During daylight.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Well,
o-o
I think I'm
o-o
getting the
o-o
general idea.
sentence-next
o-o
Efficiency
o-o
and stealing from
o-o
foreigners,
o-o
or selling to
o-o
foreigners,
o-o
is what brings
o-o
money into
o-o
a region.
sentence-next
o-o
And corruption
o-o
reduces
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which causes
o-o
economic
o-o
decline.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's a bit
o-o
fuzzy but ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My butt's fuzzy?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
If you say so.
sentence-next
o-o
I can see
o-o
it's firm.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
A similar kind of
o-o
rise and fall
o-o
pattern happened
o-o
later with the

Italian
o-o
Renaissance.
sentence-next
o-o
It started with

efficient banking.

o-o
Plus improved ships

The compass, right?

And the ship's

ambee sings-damien amenn
Of course
o-o
gunpowder.

And the digit zero.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You're astute!
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
No my ass
o-o
didn't toot!
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Astute.
sentence-next
o-o
It means your brain

just did the

equivalent of

a gymnastics

triple twist

vault
o-o
with a perfect

landing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh thanks!
sentence-next
o-o
So what kind of
o-o
corruption
o-o
ended the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Lots of the wealth
o-o
going to Rome
o-o
came from
o-o
churches
o-o
around Europe
o-o
that heavily
o-o
taxed their
o-o
members.
sentence-next
o-o
That wealth
o-o
is still visible
o-o
today in the
o-o
Vatican City.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Which is
o-o
inside
o-o
Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Even I've
o-o
heard about
o-o
the porn painted
o-o
on the ceiling
o-o
of a chapel
o-o
in Rome.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's the
o-o
Sistine Chapel
o-o
painted by
o-o
Michelangelo.
sentence-next
o-o
A second
o-o
artist
o-o
covered the
o-o
private parts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Those church taxes,
o-o
especially
o-o
indulgences,
o-o
were so corrupt
o-o
and oppressive
o-o
that Martin Luther
o-o
and others
o-o
created the
o-o
Protestant
o-o
revolution,
o-o
which led to
o-o
creating
o-o
new religions,
o-o
including
o-o
the Church
o-o
of England.
o-o
The Pilgrims who
o-o
settled the
o-o
Plymouth
o-o
Plantation
o-o
were escaping
o-o
from those
o-o
oppressive
o-o
church
o-o
taxes.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Do fewer
o-o
rich people
o-o
really hold back
o-o
on indulgences
o-o
for wine,
o-o
potato chips,
o-o
and foot
o-o
massages?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Not those kinds
o-o
of indulgences.
sentence-next
o-o
These were
o-o
documents
o-o
of forgiveness
o-o
purchased from
o-o
the church.
sentence-next
o-o
The point is
o-o
money flowing
o-o
into Rome
o-o
from Catholic
o-o
churches
o-o
dried up
o-o
because the popes
o-o
got way
o-o
too greedy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Back then
o-o
freedom of
o-o
religion
o-o
was about money,
o-o
not just beliefs.
sentence-next
o-o
And beliefs
o-o
and money
o-o
intertwined,
o-o
such as the ban
o-o
on abortions.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the link
o-o
between money
o-o
and abortions?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Less abortions
o-o
yielded bigger
o-o
congregations
o-o
paying more
o-o
donations,
o-o
and buying off
o-o
more sins.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So the
o-o
Protestant
o-o
religions
o-o
ended
o-o
the Italian
o-o
Renaissance?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not quite right.
sentence-next
o-o
The economic
o-o
reforms that
o-o
created the
o-o
efficiency
o-o
of the
o-o
Italian
o-o
Renaissance
o-o
have spread
o-o
that basis
o-o
for wealth
o-o
around the world.
sentence-next
o-o
In the meantime
o-o
Italy is still
o-o
unwinding
o-o
other kinds of
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
The same slow
o-o
progress is
o-o
happening
o-o
in Greece
o-o
and Spain,
o-o
and Portugal,
o-o
and elsewhere.
sentence-next
o-o
Those
o-o
economies
o-o
are still weak
o-o
compared to
o-o
Germany,
o-o
France, and
o-o
Britain
o-o
where there
o-o
is less
o-o
of some kinds of
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Organized
o-o
crime is
o-o
still strong
o-o
in those

economically
o-o
weaker

nations.
sentence-next
o-o
But name-econhist-nickname
o-o
can't say that part
o-o
out loud
o-o
because he could

lose more than just

tenure.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Most importantly
o-o
the
o-o
economic
o-o
success
o-o
in
o-o
America
o-o
exposed
o-o
Europe's
o-o
corruption.
sentence-next
o-o
And revealed
o-o
that democracy
o-o
has less
o-o
corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I think
o-o
I'm seeing
o-o
the pattern.
sentence-next
o-o
Higher levels
o-o
of democracy
o-o
yield less
o-o
corruption,
o-o
which causes
o-o
less waste,
o-o
which increases
o-o
efficiency,
o-o
which increases
o-o
productivity,
o-o
which yields
o-o
much better
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity.
sentence-next
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
You've got it!
sentence-next
o-o
One last bit
o-o
here is that
o-o
America
o-o
was far away
o-o
from big
o-o
armies
o-o
and navies.
sentence-next
o-o
That allowed
o-o
democracy
o-o
a place to grow.
sentence-next
o-o
That success
o-o
created
o-o
jealousy in
o-o
Europeans.
sentence-next
o-o
Eventually
o-o
they formed the
o-o
European
o-o
Union
o-o
after most
o-o
Catholics and
o-o
Protestants
o-o
stopped fighting
o-o
one another,
o-o
except in
o-o
northern
o-o
Ireland.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And they stopped
o-o
having food fights
o-o
about table
o-o
etiquette.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
And the French,
o-o
Italians,
o-o
and Germans
o-o
stopped
o-o
fighting over
o-o
language
o-o
supremecy
o-o
when they saw
o-o
the inferior
o-o
English
o-o
language was
o-o
winning that
o-o
fight.
sentence-next
o-o
So basically
o-o
they're copying
o-o
the clear
o-o
success of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
that works so well
o-o
in the
o-o
United States.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Wait a minute.
sentence-next
o-o
You said warfare
o-o
undermines the
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet political hawks,
o-o
who are mostly
o-o
conservatives,
o-o
promote warfare
o-o
as a way to
o-o
increase
o-o
prosperity.
sentence-next
o-o
And competition
o-o
between
o-o
nations,
o-o
and between
o-o
businesses,
o-o
is the basis
o-o
of prosperity
o-o
in a free market,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm lost.
sentence-next
o-o
I feel like I'm
o-o
in a maze and
o-o
someone turned off
o-o
the lights.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
Competition
o-o
between
o-o
businesses
o-o
provides
o-o
motivation
o-o
to work hard.
sentence-next
o-o
But what gets
o-o
overlooked is
o-o
the teamwork
o-o
among
o-o
employees.
sentence-next
o-o
That cooperation
o-o
yields
o-o
efficiency.
sentence-next
o-o
The same kind of
o-o
cooperation
o-o
happens among
o-o
citizens
o-o
within the same
o-o
nation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Hmm.
sentence-next
o-o
So teamwork
o-o
is more than
o-o
touchy hyphen-here feely
o-o
games?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Ah, employees
o-o
getting along,
o-o
who wouldn't
o-o
normally get along.
sentence-next
o-o
Like employees
o-o
ignoring
o-o
racial differences,
o-o
religious
o-o
differences,
o-o
and gender
o-o
differences.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh, and Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
ignoring their
o-o
differences
o-o
while at work.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I see!
sentence-next
o-o
When these
o-o
conflicts
o-o
are ignored,
o-o
that's cooperation.
sentence-next
o-o
And that increases
o-o
efficiency
o-o
begin-italics within end-italics
o-o
the business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So cooperation
o-o
within a business
o-o
makes the business
o-o
strong,
o-o
so it can better
o-o
compete against
o-o
other
o-o
businesses?
sentence-next
o-o
The lights are
o-o
coming back on.
sentence-next
o-o
I think I see.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So fighting
o-o
between groups
o-o
of people
o-o
inspires,
o-o
motivates,
o-o
cooperation
o-o
within each
o-o
group?
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
That's not a bad
o-o
simplification.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And a lack
o-o
of cooperation
o-o
is why
o-o
climate change
o-o
is turning
o-o
our planet
o-o
into toast.
end-lyric

ambee sings-econhist amenn
In the past,
o-o
higher levels
o-o
of cooperation
o-o
came from
o-o
churches and
o-o
religions.
sentence-next
o-o
They originated
o-o
public schools,
o-o
hospitals,
o-o
food for the poor,
o-o
orphanages,
o-o
and
o-o
uplifting
o-o
songs.
sentence-next
o-o
But
o-o
climate change
o-o
is a topic

that's too hot
