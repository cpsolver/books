begin-comment Illustration:
Hospital recovery room, with single hospital bed, and one chair to right and behind bed.
Venture capitalist is lying in hospital bed, hooked up to monitor showing heartbeat.
Religious minister is sitting on chair, and is holding (closed) Bible.
Father of fiance is standing on right side.
In foreground are, from left to right, Desha, Damien, fiance.
Religious minister is Desha's (biological) father, so much match Desha's general racial/genetic characteristics, and he is wearing a priest's collar and Christian priest's black clothes.
Father of fiance much match fiance's general racial/genetic characteristics, and he is a nicely dressed businessman with coat and tie.
Everyone is facing Damien, and Damien is mostly facing viewer, but his head and partially his body is facing toward right side (toward fiance), as would happen in a performance on a theatre stage.

Father,
o-o
I've given lots of money

to your worthy church.

I've asked you here
o-o
because now I search

the delay of death.

The spiritual world

the physical world

It's like a

Too big

end-lyric

ambee sings-minister-firstuse amenn
The peak
o-o
must rest on a

solid foundation
o-o
that cannot be weak.
sentence-next
o-o
So the golden rule
o-o
of doing good deeds
o-o
must rest on
o-o
a strong

o-o
not doing bad deeds.

ambee sings-minister amenn
It's not just what
o-o
I say and
o-o
what your brain thinks.
sentence-next
o-o
It's what you do.
sentence-next
o-o
It's your actions,
o-o
your behaviors,
o-o
that's what God
o-o
listens to.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
This heart attack
o-o
has me scared.
sentence-next
o-o
I don't feel prepared.

Something to

end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To cast out fear,
o-o
fill your heart with love.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what your heart
o-o
needs lots more of.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I have no kids
o-o
and no real friends.
sentence-next
o-o
I do love Benjamins,
o-o
but that's where it ends.
sentence-next
o-o
My money brings pleasure,

sentence-next
o-o
Who can I love?
sentence-next
o-o
How does that feel?
sentence-next
o-o
Is there time to love?

Can it really heal?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
To love, first you must

let go of darkness.
sentence-next
o-o
Start with understanding
o-o
that money is not evil.
sentence-next
o-o
It's greed that is evil.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Is it greedy to want
o-o
to have it all?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
We are human,
o-o
so all of us
o-o
want it all.
sentence-next
o-o
But there's not enough
o-o
time or energy to
o-o
acquire it all.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
But there are
o-o
shortcuts.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Most shortcuts
o-o
increase
o-o
suffering
o-o
for others.
sentence-next
o-o
That blocks you
o-o
from rising
o-o
spiritually,
o-o
and reaching
o-o
the highest

kinds of love.
sentence-next
o-o
That's far above
o-o
criminals
o-o
and lawyers,
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
I mean
o-o
sinners.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why
o-o
the Bible says
o-o
it's easier
o-o
for a camel
o-o
to fit through
o-o
the eye of a
o-o
needle than
o-o
for a rich man
o-o
to become
o-o
a loving saint
o-o
on earth.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I do want
o-o
to be loved.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet I'm not yet
o-o
tired of being
o-o
admired.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Which has
o-o
a higher
o-o
priority?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's all important.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
For something to be
o-o
important,
o-o
everything else
o-o
must be less
o-o
important.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
It's now
o-o
important
o-o
that I live.
sentence-next
o-o
I now believe
o-o
religion can
o-o
give me more than
o-o
what I had
o-o
before my
o-o
heart attack.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Do you embrace
o-o
religion to
o-o
do good deeds?
sentence-next
o-o
Or just to feel
o-o
less guilt for
o-o
doing deeds
o-o
that God would
o-o
frown on?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
I'm a bit lost.
sentence-next

o-o
Don't I need to
o-o
engage in
o-o
combat
o-o
against the
o-o
wicked evil
o-o
hiding in
o-o
other
o-o
people?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Wickedness
o-o
is not always
o-o
hiding in us.
sentence-next
o-o
If you're thinking
o-o
of the
o-o
wickedness
o-o
in horror flicks,
o-o
in books like
o-o
begin-italics Lord Of The Flies end-italics no-space ,
o-o
and in
o-o
super hyphen-here hero
o-o
comic books,
o-o
that's all
o-o
fiction.
sentence-next
o-o
Kid's
o-o
soccer games
o-o
and
o-o
reality
o-o
TV
o-o
have to
o-o
artificially
o-o
inject
o-o
scarcity
o-o
because
o-o
otherwise
o-o
participants
o-o
cooperate.
sentence-next
o-o
And that's
o-o
more boring
o-o
than a gun
o-o
in the hands of
o-o
a blind
o-o
pacifist.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What about
o-o
the news?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
News sources
o-o
make their money
o-o
by selling your
o-o
eyeballs and
o-o
ears to
o-o
advertisers.
sentence-next
o-o
They attract
o-o
your attention
o-o
with stories
o-o
that put a
o-o
magnifying glass
o-o
on the acts
o-o
of audacious
o-o
criminals,
o-o
slimy
o-o
politicians,
o-o
and other
o-o
morons.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What about the
o-o
Holocaust?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
During a time of
o-o
nationwide
o-o
starvation,
o-o
and massive
o-o
economic
o-o
suffering,
o-o
plus mass
o-o
stupidity,
o-o
the Nazi
o-o
government
o-o
encouraged
o-o
non hyphen-here Jewish
o-o
Germans
o-o
to steal gold
o-o
and cash and
o-o
houses and
o-o
businesses
o-o
and dignity
o-o
from Jews.
sentence-next
o-o
Ironically
o-o
part of the
o-o
reason Jews
o-o
had become
o-o
wealthy is that
o-o
early Christians
o-o
were taught
o-o
they should not
o-o
charge interest
o-o
when lending
o-o
money,
o-o
so Christians
o-o
asked Jews
o-o
living in
o-o
ghettos
o-o
to do the
o-o
lending.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
That explains
o-o
why Jews
o-o
aren't a small
o-o
minority
o-o
in the banking
o-o
industry
o-o
and in
o-o
New York City.
sentence-next
o-o
But
o-o
surely there's
o-o
no excuse for
o-o
the evil in
o-o
the terrorists
o-o
in the
o-o
Middle East.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Terrorists
o-o
and soldiers
o-o
fight to help
o-o
their family,
o-o
their comrades,
o-o
and to earn
o-o
money.
sentence-next
o-o
An ideology
o-o
is mostly
o-o
the frosting
o-o
on the cookie.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
What if the
o-o
ideology is
o-o
money?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes,
o-o
an
o-o
opportunity
o-o
to gain
o-o
money or wealth
o-o
is behind lots
o-o
and lots of
o-o
evil deeds.
sentence-next
o-o
Like when
o-o
Japanese
o-o
Americans
o-o
were put into
o-o
concentration
o-o
camps
o-o
partly as
o-o
a way to steal
o-o
the valuable
o-o
southern
o-o
California
o-o
farmland
o-o
that lots of
o-o
Japanese
o-o
Americans
o-o
owned.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Is there an
o-o
antidote?
sentence-next
o-o
To evil?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Yes,
o-o
talking.
sentence-next
o-o
To people on
o-o
the other side.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Talking.
sentence-next
o-o
I do lots
o-o
of that,
o-o
as part of
o-o
business.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Do you ask
o-o
questions
o-o
with a desire
o-o
to understand
o-o
the other person's
o-o
point of view?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Why would I
o-o
do that?
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Consider what
o-o
ended apartheid
o-o
in South
o-o
Africa.
sentence-next
o-o
It was secret
o-o
talks.
sentence-next
o-o
One of them
o-o
was between
o-o
Nelson Mandela,
o-o
and a
o-o
clergyman,
o-o
and the
o-o
clergyman's
o-o
twin brother
o-o
who led a
o-o
militant
o-o
group that
o-o
supported
o-o
apartheid.
sentence-next
o-o
Through talking,
o-o
Mandela
o-o
and the
o-o
pro hyphen-here apartheid
o-o
leader
o-o
discovered
o-o
unexpected
o-o
common ground.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Does this work in
o-o
relationships?
sentence-next
o-o
I admit
o-o
I could use
o-o
some of those
o-o
kinds of tips.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Indeed.
sentence-next
o-o
But don't expect
o-o
you'll ever
o-o
find out
o-o
what's in the
o-o
other person's
o-o
mind.
sentence-next
o-o
Your goal should be
o-o
to seek a path
o-o
that benefits
o-o
both sides.
sentence-next
o-o
Talking helps
o-o
you find that
o-o
path.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
My head is
o-o
spinning.
sentence-next
o-o
Without money
o-o
as a compass
o-o
I'm lost.
sentence-next
o-o
And winning.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the only
o-o
goal I know.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
Ah, yes,
o-o
winning.
sentence-next
o-o
Parents
o-o
and teachers
o-o
and managers
o-o
use winning
o-o
prizes
o-o
to entice
o-o
kids and
o-o
young people
o-o
to learn.
sentence-next
o-o
But the real goal
o-o
is the learning.
sentence-next
o-o
With maturity
o-o
we leave behind
o-o
the gold stars,
o-o
the shiny
o-o
trophies,
o-o
the memory
o-o
of being
o-o
employee
o-o
of the month,
o-o
and even
o-o
the dream of
o-o
a huge
o-o
audience
o-o
loudly chanting
o-o
your name.
sentence-next
o-o
The skills
o-o
we've learned
o-o
remain,
o-o
long after
o-o
the prizes
o-o
have been
o-o
forgotten,
o-o
and the
o-o
evidence
o-o
is buried
o-o
under the
o-o
rubble of
o-o
fighting
o-o
old battles.
sentence-next
o-o
Now the skill
o-o
you seek is
o-o
spirituality.
sentence-next
o-o
It's trophy
o-o
is joy.
sentence-next
o-o
So it's time
o-o
to let go of
o-o
immaturity.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You're ripping
o-o
away what's
o-o
familiar.
sentence-next
o-o
Can you give me
o-o
a second
o-o
compass?
sentence-next
o-o
One that points up
o-o
to higher goals?
sentence-next
o-o
And a flashlight
o-o
that points down
o-o
to the sharp rocks

my ass?

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
On the contrary!
sentence-next
o-o
People from elsewhere
o-o
move here.
sentence-next
o-o
And they bring
o-o
their wealth
o-o
into the local
o-o
economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That brings
o-o
money to you,
o-o
but it increases
o-o
traffic, and
o-o
increases
o-o
infrastructure
o-o
costs to those of us
o-o
already here.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And it pushes up
o-o
the cost of
o-o
housing,
o-o
which pushes
o-o
more and more
o-o
people into
o-o
homelessness.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Plus your business
o-o
requires lots of
o-o
regulation,

which is a drain

budgets.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Tell me which kinds

of businesses
o-o
would get lower

taxes.

ambee sings-damien amenn
The ones that bring

non hyphen-here chain restaurants,
o-o
and such.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
They get lower taxes?
sentence-next
o-o
Why?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Because they
o-o
bring a net flow
o-o
of money into
o-o
the city
o-o
and county.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
You said non hyphen-here chain
o-o
restaurants.
sentence-next
o-o
Why not chain
o-o
restaurants?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
They send lots
o-o
of their profits
o-o
to corporate
o-o
headquarters,
o-o
which drains
o-o
money from
o-o
the city and
o-o
state where the
o-o
restaurant's
o-o
located.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And nobody
o-o
drives to a city
o-o
as their travel
o-o
destination
o-o
because
o-o
the city has
o-o
Burger King
o-o
franchise
o-o
locations.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
My business

But only

temporarily.
sentence-next
o-o
After

the jobs are gone.
sentence-next
o-o
The kinds of

Oh, I think I'm

sentence-next
o-o
Raise taxes on

o-o
on activities
o-o
that enrich the

economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Exactly!
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
So it taxes the sinners
o-o
and helps the saints?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
That's a useful
o-o
way to view it.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
I like it!
sentence-next
o-o
Even though
o-o
it might offend
o-o
many of the
o-o
folks who need

religion
o-o
the most.

Our church

o-o
Yet we do

promote

good deeds
o-o
and frown on
o-o
exploitation.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
So the
o-o
different
o-o
tax rates are
o-o
like the
o-o
difference
o-o
between a
o-o
word-resume
o-o
and a
o-o
eulogy.
sentence-next
o-o
A word-resume
o-o
values money,
o-o
a eulogy
o-o
values
o-o
benefiting
o-o
others.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Interesting
o-o
distinction!
sentence-next
o-o
What I've accomplished
o-o
would look fabulous
o-o
on a word-resume no-space .
sentence-next
o-o
But now it's time
o-o
to consider what
o-o
might be said
o-o
in my eulogy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I don't see the
o-o
difference.
sentence-next
o-o
But then religion
o-o
isn't my thing.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Lately, with the
o-o
worlds of business
o-o
and government
o-o
declining
o-o
in ethics,
o-o
we the voters
o-o
need to fight
o-o
for fairness!
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
So is fairness
o-o
or money more
o-o
important to
o-o
you?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why can't we
o-o
get both?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Getting to the
o-o
point, do you want
o-o
to earn more money
o-o
so we can afford
o-o
maybe a few
o-o
luxuries in life?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to build
o-o
a business that
o-o
provides something
o-o
that benefits the
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
My original
o-o
plan was to
o-o
manufacture
o-o
my leaf gutter
o-o
cleaning tool
o-o
so that fewer
o-o
people fall off
o-o
ladders
o-o
when cleaning their
o-o
gutters.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet lately,
o-o
other inventions
o-o
have been popping
o-o
into my mind.
sentence-next
o-o
Most are for the
o-o
kitchen food prep
o-o
appliance
o-o
someone told us
o-o
about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Your mind is in
o-o
the gutter.
sentence-next
o-o
None of that
o-o
makes sense.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Mmm, I'm
o-o
beginning
o-o
to see the
o-o
value of
o-o
creating
o-o
that kind of
o-o
business
o-o
if it gets
o-o
taxed less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And fewer toes
o-o
would get
o-o
stepped on.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And fewer fingers
o-o
would get cut
o-o
doing food prep.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As a
o-o
bachelor,
o-o
a kitchen
o-o
food prep machine
o-o
sounds like
o-o
maybe a good
o-o
alternative
o-o
to getting
o-o
so much takeout
o-o
delivered.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
I admit
o-o
a food prep
o-o
appliance
o-o
would reduce
o-o
labor costs
o-o
for my favorite
o-o
restaurants,
o-o
so maybe
o-o
that would make
o-o
dining out
o-o
cost less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yet another
o-o
benefit of
o-o
taxing takers
o-o
more than makers
o-o
is that very smart
o-o
well hyphen-here educated
o-o
people would be less
o-o
attracted to
o-o
soul hyphen-here sucking
o-o
jobs in
o-o
banks and
o-o
law firms.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And real estate.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Instead they'd

work where they

economy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Well said!

sentence-next
o-o
That's what Willie

end-lyric

So who's going to

believe this nonsense
o-o
that different ballots

and different ways
o-o
of counting votes
o-o
is really going
o-o
to make things better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
This situation
o-o
is like when women

sentence-next
o-o
A few places,
o-o
like Canada,

Australia, and

New Zealand,
o-o
tried it.

Then a few western

states tried it.
sentence-next
o-o
The predicted

follow,

And don't you think
o-o
it's made things better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Sometimes I wonder.

We don't seem to be

a big backyard
