Single Mark Ballots Are The Enemy


We have done the math, and single-mark ballots are the enemy.

Government is not the enemy; they are controlled by politicians.

Politicians are not the enemy; they do what a combination of lobbyists and voters tell them to do.

Lobbyists are not the enemy; they do what large corporations and rich individuals pay them to do.

Large corporations are not the enemy; they are guided by corporate boards of directors.

Corporate boards of directors are not the enemy; but they are elected using single-mark ballots.

Voters are not blind; but we can only mark a single choice on the ballot.

Shareholders who vote for board members are not blind; but board-member elections also use single-mark ballots.

Single-mark ballots are not grossly miscounted; but they can be counted in only one, unfair, way.

Single-mark ballot do not collect enough information to always reveal which candidate is really the most popular.

Let's start using ranked choice ballots.

Let's move single-mark ballots into the history books.

Let's move beyond marking only a single choice.

Let's move up to higher levels of democracy.

Let's replace single-mark ballots.

Let's try true democracy.
