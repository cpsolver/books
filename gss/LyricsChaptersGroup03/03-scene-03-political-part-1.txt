rallies.

kinds of bugs.
sentence-next
o-o
We politicians

From

political

spies.

To voters.
sentence-next
o-o
If we told

o-o
And they make

such a fuss
o-o
if we just

vote for a bill
o-o
that might drop
o-o
their gross income
o-o
by the price of

That is gross.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn

abortionists,
o-o
tree huggers,
o-o
and bitches.
sentence-next
o-o
Those
o-o
right hyphen-here and hyphen-here left names
o-o
entertainingly
o-o
distract
o-o
from the fact
o-o
there's a bigger
o-o
conflict.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's bigger than
o-o
the fight
o-o
between left 'n
o-o
right?

political
o-o
terrain.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
My brain
o-o
is open wide
o-o
'n ready to be
o-o
stupefied.
end-lyric

o-o
fight is
o-o
between the

political up
o-o
and the
o-o
political down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Political up?
sentence-next
o-o
Political down?
sentence-next
o-o
Where did
o-o
left and right
o-o
go to?
sentence-next
o-o
What's up?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
The political up,
o-o
that's where most
o-o
voters are.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voters of which
o-o
party?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Both parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How can that be?
sentence-next
o-o
Both Republicans
o-o
and Democrats
o-o
are in the
o-o
political up?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Stop thinking of
o-o
voters as
o-o
Republicans
o-o
and
o-o
Democrats.
sentence-next
o-o
It's us
o-o
politicians,
o-o
and the party
o-o
insiders,
o-o
who are
o-o
Republicans
o-o
and
o-o
Democrats.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So is this like
o-o
Star begin-italics Wars end-italics fans
o-o
also can be
o-o
Star begin-italics Trek end-italics
o-o
fans?
sentence-next
o-o
And the
o-o
opposite?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Heck,
o-o
if this is news
o-o
to you,
o-o
maybe you too
o-o
have failed to
o-o
recognize
o-o
that both
o-o
parties are
o-o
controlled by
o-o
people who
o-o
utilize
o-o
money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That part I knew.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
The biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors
o-o
are in the
o-o
political down.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The biggest
o-o
contributors?
sentence-next
o-o
Should we
o-o
be puttin' down
o-o
fat people?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Not that kind
o-o
of biggest.
sentence-next
o-o
They give the
o-o
biggest amounts
o-o
of money.
sentence-next
o-o
They provide
o-o
the money source
o-o
that lifts us
o-o
politicians
o-o
high in the polls.
sentence-next
o-o
They've bought
o-o
our souls.
sentence-next
o-o
Without their dough
o-o
we get dashed
o-o
against the rocks
o-o
during a
o-o
primary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
You're talkin' 'bout
o-o
rich folks,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Of course they're
o-o
all rich.
sentence-next
o-o
But some
o-o
of the rich
o-o
are in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
How can that be?
sentence-next
o-o
I'm as confused
o-o
as if I just
o-o
stepped out from an
o-o
industrial
o-o
laundry
o-o
washer
o-o
during the
o-o
high hyphen-here spin
o-o
cycle.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Confused by
o-o
the spin.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the state
o-o
most voters
o-o
are in.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the aim
o-o
of the
o-o
political
o-o
down.
sentence-next
o-o
So of course
o-o
they resist
o-o
adopting
o-o
a name.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
But among themselves
o-o
they call themselves
o-o
the political down?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
No.
sentence-next
o-o
That's just
o-o
how I think of
o-o
them.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
This
o-o
upfront
o-o
lowdown is
o-o
blindingly
o-o
illuminatin'.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Of course
o-o
lots of wealthy
o-o
folks in the
o-o
political down
o-o
prefer our party,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Even I
o-o
can see that.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Yet many people
o-o
in the
o-o
political down
o-o
have infiltrated
o-o
the Democratic
o-o
party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Voting in both parties?
sentence-next
o-o
That's illegal.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You're thinking of votes.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm talking about money.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Whoa!
sentence-next
o-o
How come the
o-o
political
o-o
down
o-o
gives money
o-o
to both
o-o
left and right
o-o
parties?
sentence-next
o-o
That's as stupid
o-o
as placin' bets
o-o
on both horses
o-o
in a
o-o
two hyphen-here horse race.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Ah, here's a
o-o
big secret.
sentence-next
o-o
They assist
o-o
horses,
o-o
er, candidates,
o-o
in their
o-o
disliked
o-o
party
o-o
only during
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
Of course I'm
o-o
dumbing things down.
end-lyric
