figurin' this out.
sentence-next
o-o
It's not what I
o-o
expected.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet it makes
o-o
too much sense
o-o
to be

fictional.

There's one bit

of history
o-o
I should

teach you.
end-lyric

Oh I hate

history.

Crammin' more facts

This is simple.
sentence-next
o-o
Back when
o-o
primary
o-o
elections
o-o
were uncommon,
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
was obvious.
sentence-next
o-o
There was just
o-o
one election,
o-o
the one we
o-o
now call the
o-o
general
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
Sometimes a
o-o
political
o-o
party offered
o-o
two or

even three
o-o
candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
If the other
o-o
big party
o-o
offered just begin-italics one end-italics

candidate,
o-o
that solo
o-o
one won.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Oh,
o-o
'cause voters
o-o
in the losin'
o-o
party would
o-o
split their votes
o-o
among their
o-o
similar
o-o
candidates.
sentence-next
o-o
The divide
o-o
and conquer
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
The winning
o-o
strategy
o-o
came to be
o-o
for each party
o-o
to have their own
o-o
primary.
sentence-next
o-o
The idea was
o-o
to discover
o-o
which politician
o-o
deserves
o-o
that party's
o-o
solo spot
o-o
on the general
o-o
election
o-o
ballot.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah!
sentence-next
o-o
Now the splittin's
o-o
hidden in
o-o
primaries.
sentence-next
o-o
Where the winner's

never from

the wrong party.

And the winner's

always a puppet.

against

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Based on what
o-o
you've taught,

some wealthy

business owners

may have thought,

that well,
o-o
...

You're on the

to defeat their

bigger enemy,

Clinton.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Correct so far.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N they probably
o-o
made the
o-o
assumption
o-o
that a black man
o-o
couldn't win
o-o
the general
o-o
election.
sentence-next
o-o
Is that right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You did it!
sentence-next
o-o
That's right!
sentence-next
o-o
Although of course
o-o
we cannot trace
o-o
all donations.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet when we can
o-o
track it,
o-o
that donation
o-o
pattern often
o-o
happens.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The
o-o
Republicans
o-o
...
o-o
er, fans of
o-o
Republican
o-o
politicians,
o-o
who gave
o-o
contributions
o-o
to Obama
o-o
must've chuckled

when they

donated.

o-o
Then raged for days
o-o
when they got an

African
o-o
American
o-o
president.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
And that gives you
o-o
an example
o-o
of a blocking
o-o
tactic that
o-o
wouldn't work
o-o
if vote splitting
o-o
were not such a
o-o
useful gimmick
o-o
for rigging
o-o
elections.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I heard what you said.
sentence-next
o-o
But the words
o-o
leaked out
o-o
of my brain
o-o
without
o-o
leaving behind
o-o
any idea 'bout
o-o
what they mean.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
If unfair
o-o
vote splitting
o-o
were to
o-o
disappear,
o-o
then that blocking
o-o
kind of tactic
o-o
wouldn't
o-o
interfere.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
in the general
o-o
election,
o-o
each party
o-o
would offer
o-o
begin-italics two end-italics or begin-italics three end-italics
o-o
selections,
o-o
candidates.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm confused again.
sentence-next
o-o
How can there be
o-o
two Republicans
o-o
and two
o-o
Democrats
o-o
on the ballot?
sentence-next
o-o
That would cause
o-o
vote splitting.
sentence-next
o-o
Some things
o-o
are becomin'
o-o
clear.
sentence-next
o-o
But what can make
o-o
the evil split
o-o
disappear?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
I really don't know,
o-o
and don't care.
sentence-next
o-o
The political stress
o-o
was making a mess
o-o
of my ulcers.
sentence-next
o-o
Giving them
o-o
their own ulcers.
sentence-next
o-o
So I won't be
o-o
running for
o-o
re-election.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why I can
o-o
risk speaking
o-o
candidly.
sentence-next
o-o
But remember
o-o
you didn't learn
o-o
any of this
o-o
from me.
sentence-next
o-o
If you go
o-o
to newspaper
o-o
reporters
o-o
with these insights
o-o
I'll shine

light on
o-o
the skeletons
o-o
in the closet

money using

his tricks.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I won't be a

snitch or fink.
sentence-next
o-o
'N anyways I
o-o
can't yet link
o-o
the problem of
o-o
vote splittin'
o-o
to a solution.
sentence-next
o-o
One that can
o-o
defeat this
o-o
unfairness.
sentence-next
o-o
So I need to
o-o
learn more.
sentence-next
o-o
Do you know who
o-o
would know how
o-o
to fix this
o-o
mess?
sentence-next
o-o
The unfair
o-o
politics?

Well I've got to go.
sentence-next
o-o
I wish you luck
o-o
in understanding
o-o
yet more
o-o
so maybe someday
o-o
you can help clean up
o-o
the muck
o-o
on the
o-o
political
o-o
stage.
sentence-next
o-o
In the meantime,
o-o
the political
o-o
world is
o-o
upside down.
sentence-next
o-o
Voters
o-o
mistakenly
o-o
assume the rich
o-o
are at
o-o
the top.
sentence-next
o-o
Yes, politicians
o-o
have all been bought.
sentence-next
o-o
But as voters
o-o
you've got
o-o
more power than
o-o
the SpaceX
o-o
rockets,
o-o
a swarm of
o-o
locusts,
o-o
and a flu
o-o
virus,
o-o
all working
o-o
together on
o-o
the same team.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So you think
o-o
maybe someday
o-o
the voters
o-o
will,
o-o
uh,
o-o
...

o-o

...
o-o
reign
o-o
supreme?
sentence-next
o-o
Eventually.
sentence-next
o-o
Hopefully.
sentence-next
o-o
Then us
o-o
politicians
o-o
will become begin-italics your end-italics

puppets.

But currently

we're the puppets
o-o
of wealthy

business

I admit
o-o
I'm seein' a

bit of hope

for a fix.
sentence-next

To get less
o-o
dysfunctional

politics.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I know the

greedy rich

left versus right.
