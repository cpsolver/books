That fits my brain.
sentence-next
o-o
Now I see!
sentence-next
o-o
They use money
o-o
to influence
o-o
who wins each
o-o
Democratic
o-o
begin-italics primary end-italics no-space !
sentence-next
o-o
But in the
o-o
general
o-o
election
o-o
they just embrace
o-o
the puppet
o-o
candidate
o-o
they like
o-o
better?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Isn't it
o-o
brilliant?
sentence-next
o-o
Yet seductive.
sentence-next
o-o
Like the
o-o
gleaming smile
o-o
of a fetching lass
o-o
in an auto ad.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I'm
o-o
beginning to see
o-o
how come we,
o-o
er,
o-o
most voters,
o-o
dislike both
o-o
candidates,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
begin-italics and end-italics the Democrat.
sentence-next
o-o
I don't mean
o-o
any
o-o
disrespect.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
A lack of
o-o
respect
o-o
is what we
o-o
politicians
o-o
expect.
sentence-next
o-o
We know
o-o
we're stuck
o-o
in the middle.
sentence-next
o-o
Between voters
o-o
and our biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
sentence-next
o-o
Now do you see
o-o
why voters
o-o
are distracted
o-o
by the
o-o
entertaining
o-o
conflict
o-o
between left
o-o
and right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Instead of words
o-o
I need a
o-o
picture.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
It's sort of like
o-o
when ancient
o-o
Roman rulers
o-o
distracted their
o-o
plebeians
o-o
with dramatic
o-o
bloody fighting
o-o
in their
o-o
colossal
o-o
Colosseum.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
So it's like
o-o
funding two cults,
o-o
or two gangs,
o-o
that fight each other
o-o
on stage?
sentence-next
o-o
While the
o-o
funders
o-o
quietly
o-o
remove money
o-o
from our
o-o
wallets
o-o
while we're
o-o
distracted?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's a bit rough.
sentence-next
o-o
But close enough.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The fighters
o-o
who attacked
o-o
Congress
o-o
sure were duped
o-o
by the fake fight
o-o
between left
o-o
and right.
sentence-next
o-o
They believed
o-o
their cult
o-o
was defending
o-o
democracy.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Indeed,
o-o
their vision
o-o
was out of focus.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
With their clout,
o-o
what's the
o-o
political down
o-o
really care
o-o
about?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Profits for the
o-o
businesses
o-o
they own.
sentence-next
o-o
What especially
o-o
delights them
o-o
are biz tax breaks.
sentence-next
o-o
And when they can
o-o
get a legal
o-o
monopoly
o-o
they grasp
o-o
onto that
o-o
like a
o-o
Titanic
o-o
passenger
o-o
would cling
o-o
to a spare
o-o
life vest.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
Those business
o-o
owners pay
o-o
politicians
o-o
for lower taxes
o-o
'n no
o-o
competition.
sentence-next
o-o
That deal's sweet!
sentence-next
o-o
But that's
o-o
cheating.
sentence-next
o-o
It's corrupt.
sentence-next
o-o
Am I wrong?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
You're right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I'm confused.
sentence-next
o-o
On the
o-o
political
o-o
right,
o-o
the Republican
o-o
party seems to
o-o
care about some
o-o
non-business
o-o
issues like
o-o
abortions, and
o-o
gay marriage,
o-o
Christian values,
o-o
immigration,
o-o
'n such,
o-o
right?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
They do glorify
o-o
those things on the
o-o
flag they fly.
sentence-next
o-o
But taxes, and
o-o
subsidies, and
o-o
monopolies
o-o
are their
o-o
real priorities.
sentence-next
o-o
That's because
o-o
party insiders,
o-o
in both parties,
o-o
get their
o-o
marching orders
o-o
from the biggest
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributors.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Now I think I'm
o-o
seeing how come
o-o
neither
o-o
political
o-o
party
o-o
really
o-o
gives a damn
o-o
'bout giving 
o-o
homeless folks
o-o
an assist,
o-o
ending school
o-o
shootings,
o-o
helping
o-o
Latinos who
o-o
don't vote.
sentence-next
o-o
Or listening
o-o
to what dolphins
o-o
have to say
o-o
about us
o-o
dumping trash
o-o
into their
o-o
swimming pool.
sentence-next
o-o
I see the
o-o
down folks
o-o
are using
o-o
religious
o-o
'n racial
o-o
'n gender
o-o
issues
o-o
to divide 'n
o-o
distract.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
And remember
o-o
it's the biggest
o-o
contributors.
sentence-next
o-o
Some kinds of small
o-o
businesses
o-o
get overlooked.
sentence-next
o-o
Unless they join with
o-o
similar
o-o
businesses
o-o
and hire
o-o
lobbyists
o-o
to look out for
o-o
their shared
o-o
interests.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah,
o-o
you have to
o-o
ignore any
o-o
businesses
o-o
that can't afford
o-o
lobbyists.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
We know we can't
o-o
please everyone.
sentence-next
o-o
...
sentence-next
o-o
Here's another
o-o
diversion tactic.
sentence-next
o-o
Money from the right
o-o
can fund
o-o
extreme agendas
o-o
on the left.
sentence-next
o-o
Like when the
o-o
LGB category
o-o
got extended
o-o
to include
o-o
queers and
o-o
transgenders.
sentence-next
o-o
That scares
o-o
lots of voters
o-o
to the right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah,
o-o
many voters
o-o
blindly
o-o
believe
o-o
the enemy
o-o
of their
o-o
enemy
o-o
is their
o-o
friend.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
That's a powerful
o-o
political
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It's foolish.
sentence-next
o-o
'Cause no one
o-o
can keep
o-o
begin-italics all end-italics their
o-o
enemies
o-o
in the opposite
o-o
team.
sentence-next
o-o
Not with just
o-o
two teams.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Here's something else
o-o
you should know.
sentence-next
o-o
It's easy
o-o
to hide the
o-o
giving of funds
o-o
to both sides,
o-o
left and right.
sentence-next
o-o
In fact there are
o-o
two brothers in
o-o
Florida in
o-o
the sugar biz.
sentence-next
o-o
One brother is
o-o
a Republican
o-o
who gives buckets
o-o
of money to
o-o
Republican
o-o
politicians.
sentence-next
o-o
The other brother
o-o
is a Democrat
o-o
who gives buckets
o-o
of money to
o-o
Democratic
o-o
politicians.
sentence-next
o-o
Ain't that sweet?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
'N as hard to follow
o-o
as a rat
o-o
chased by
o-o
a cat.
sentence-next
o-o
So they don't
o-o
give a damn 'bout
o-o
left or right?
sentence-next
o-o
They just lobby
o-o
for sugar ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Subsidies.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
tax money
o-o
that pays for
o-o
canals in Florida
o-o
so farmers
o-o
can grow
o-o
sugarcane.
sentence-next
o-o
They need that for
o-o
the bigger
o-o
financial gains
o-o
that come from
o-o
converting
o-o
sugarcane into
o-o
sugar.
sentence-next
o-o
That's what's done
o-o
by the businesses
o-o
those bros own.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a sour
o-o
deal for us.
sentence-next
o-o
How come this
o-o
isn't more
o-o
obvious?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
On commodity
o-o
price lists,
o-o
they used to list
o-o
sugar and
o-o
U.S. sugar
o-o
by those names.
sentence-next
o-o
But now
o-o
the names are
o-o
sugar number
o-o
eleven and
o-o
sugar number
o-o
sixteen.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
That's a
o-o
slick trick.
sentence-next
o-o
Um,
o-o
there's something
o-o
else that's a bit
o-o
fuzzy.
sentence-next
o-o
Don't some
o-o
rich folks
o-o
prefer the
o-o
Democratic
o-o
party?
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Lots of lawyers
o-o
get lots of their
o-o
business from
o-o
Democratic voters,
o-o
so they like
o-o
Democratic
o-o
politicians.
sentence-next
o-o
And then there are
o-o
industries that
o-o
subdivide into
o-o
left and right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Huh?
sentence-next
o-o
I thought I was
o-o
following you
o-o
down main street,
o-o
but you just
o-o
ducked into a
o-o
dark alley.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
Banks prefer the
o-o
Republican party.
sentence-next
o-o
'N credit unions
o-o
prefer the
o-o
Democratic party.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Wow!
sentence-next
o-o
I think now I'm
o-o
seeing who's
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
down.
sentence-next
o-o
'N how come they
o-o
oppose us, the
o-o
voters,
o-o
their suckers,
o-o
in the
o-o
political
o-o
up.
sentence-next
o-o
But how do so
o-o
very few
o-o
rich folks
o-o
outvote us,
o-o
the non-rich,
o-o
who
o-o
outnumber
o-o
them?
sentence-next
o-o
Like ants
o-o
outnumber humans
o-o
doing cleanup
o-o
at picnics.
end-lyric

ambee sings-politician amenn
There are lots
o-o
of tricks
o-o
to control
o-o
politics.
sentence-next
o-o
For example,
o-o
do you know what
o-o
delegates are?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Sure,
o-o
that's the
o-o
laundry cycle
o-o
women use to
