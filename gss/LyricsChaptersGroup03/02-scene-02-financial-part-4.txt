to that partial
o-o
legal

o-o
because drug

qualifies as
o-o
research.

sentence-next
o-o

legal.

For that

are there
o-o
other tricks?
sentence-next
o-o
For getting

big profits?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As many as an
o-o
eagle has feathers.
sentence-next
o-o
Another is
o-o
slowing down

o-o
slight
o-o
improvement.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
What's the
o-o
most important
o-o
trick?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn

o-o
giving
o-o
campaign
o-o
contributions
o-o
to political
o-o
candidates.
sentence-next

monopolies,
o-o
and
o-o
taxpayer hyphen-here funded
o-o
subsidies.
sentence-next
o-o
That's why big

end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Ah yes, money
o-o
in politics.
sentence-next
o-o
I know 'bout that.
sentence-next
o-o
But I don't yet
o-o
understand
o-o
why us voters,
o-o
er,
o-o
...
o-o
how it works.
sentence-next
o-o
Non hyphen-here rich voters
o-o
greatly outnumber
o-o
the wealthy,

outweigh those votes?
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn

o-o
infiltrated
o-o
both parties.
sentence-next

o-o
control who wins
o-o
the primary
o-o

Democrat.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Yeah, puppets win.
sentence-next
o-o
I knew that part.
sentence-next
o-o
But I hadn't
o-o
noticed the
o-o
infiltration
o-o
tactic.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
In the primary,
o-o
the winner's always
o-o
from the correct party,
o-o
so the money
o-o
bias goes
o-o
unchallenged.
sentence-next
o-o
In the
o-o
general
o-o
election
o-o
Republican
o-o
voters
o-o
assume
o-o
Democrats
o-o
are dimwits,
o-o
and Democratic
o-o
voters
o-o
assume
o-o
Republicans
o-o
are dimwits.
sentence-next
o-o
But then
o-o
it's too late.
sentence-next
o-o
For added
o-o
insurance
o-o
in a tight race
o-o
we might give a
o-o
bit of money
o-o
to an unpopular
o-o
candidate
o-o
we hate.
sentence-next
o-o
But we give
o-o
far more to
o-o
the one we
o-o
choose.
sentence-next
o-o
That way we
o-o
can't lose.
