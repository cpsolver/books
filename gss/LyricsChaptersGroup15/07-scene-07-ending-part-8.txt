Plus,
o-o
more of the money
o-o
will go into
o-o
the local
o-o
economy.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember
o-o
women tend
o-o
to choose jobs
o-o
where they can help
o-o
children,
o-o
nurse folks
o-o
to better health,
o-o
help
o-o
customers,
o-o
and
o-o
sell toy
o-o
dinosaurs.
sentence-next
o-o
Currently
o-o
those jobs pay less.
sentence-next
o-o
When those women
o-o
earn more,
o-o
they will spend
o-o
more of it
o-o
doing good things
o-o
for their family
o-o
and the
o-o
community.
sentence-next
That's way better
o-o
than male
o-o
managers and
o-o
executives
o-o
buying bigger 
o-o
fishing boats,
o-o
and paying for
o-o
their bored wives
o-o
to get their
o-o
entertainment
o-o
at shopping malls.

o-o
fewer strikes
o-o
by workers
o-o
asking for

higher wages.

something like

Universal basic income.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Finally
o-o
we agree
o-o
on something.
sentence-next
o-o
That idea doesn't
o-o
deserve to
o-o
exist.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And it wouldn't
o-o
be getting
o-o
attention
o-o
if business
o-o
owners reduced
o-o
the wage gap.
sentence-next
o-o
Remember
o-o
capitalism
o-o
is about supply
o-o
and demand.
sentence-next
o-o
When you supply
o-o
better hyphen-here paying jobs
o-o
there will be lots
o-o
of demand
o-o
for those jobs
o-o
so you'll get
o-o
better hyphen-here qualified
o-o
applicants.
sentence-next
o-o
In other words
o-o
tax credits can

Dalai Lama calls

ambee sings-minister amenn
Translating

name-minister no-space ,

also
o-o
you were right

about talking.

Now I see
o-o
it's not that
o-o
simple.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
There are
o-o
nut jobs
o-o
in both parties.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm now
o-o
registered
o-o
as a
o-o
Republican.
sentence-next
o-o
So I can vote in
o-o
Republican
o-o
primaries.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
So you're a
o-o
Republican?
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'll still vote for
o-o
Democratic
o-o
candidates
o-o
in general
o-o
elections.
sentence-next
o-o
But now,
o-o
in the primary,
o-o
I'll vote for
o-o
the least
o-o
repugnant
o-o
Republican
o-o
contestant
o-o
who has a chance
o-o
of getting
o-o
nominated.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

I'll vote for
o-o
Republicans.
sentence-next
o-o
Mostly I'll push
o-o
for ranked
o-o
choice voting.
sentence-next
o-o
So we can get
o-o
fairness
o-o
and widespread
o-o
economic
o-o
prosperity
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
So is fairness
o-o
or economic
o-o
prosperity
o-o
more important
o-o
to you?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Why can't we
o-o
get both?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Getting to the
o-o
point, do you want
o-o
to earn more money
o-o
so we can afford
o-o
maybe a few
o-o
luxuries in life?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I want to build
o-o
a business that
o-o
provides something
o-o
that benefits the
o-o
customers.
sentence-next
o-o
My original
o-o
plan was to
o-o
manufacture
o-o
my leaf gutter
o-o
cleaning tool
o-o
so that fewer
o-o
people fall off
o-o
ladders
o-o
when cleaning their
o-o
gutters.
sentence-next
o-o
Yet lately,
o-o
other inventions
o-o

into my mind.
sentence-next
o-o
Most are for the
o-o
kitchen food hyphen-here prep
o-o
appliance
o-o

o-o
about.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Your mind is in
o-o
the gutter.
sentence-next
o-o
None of that
o-o
makes sense.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Mmm, I'm
o-o
beginning
o-o
to see the
o-o
value of
o-o
creating
o-o
that kind of
o-o
business
o-o
if it gets
o-o
taxed less.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
And fewer toes
o-o
would get
o-o
stepped on.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
And fewer fingers
o-o
would get cut
o-o
doing food prep.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
As a
o-o
bachelor,
o-o
a kitchen
o-o
food hyphen-here prep machine
o-o
sounds useful.
sentence-next
o-o
Especially
o-o
now that
o-o
my food hyphen-here prep
o-o
routine
o-o
won't be
o-o
opening
o-o
containers
o-o
of takeout
o-o
and ice cream.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn

ambee sings-desha amenn
name-desha no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
It makes sense to me sir.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
So name-fiance no-space ,
o-o
do you still want
o-o
this guy as your
o-o
future husband?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
So name-damien no-space ,
o-o
do you still want
o-o
to work hard so
o-o
we can enjoy a
o-o
nice lifestyle?
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Willing to work hard,
o-o
that I'm willing
o-o
to do.
sentence-next
o-o
But how nice of
o-o
a lifestyle
o-o
do you have
o-o
in mind?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Just a cute
o-o
three hyphen-here bedroom
o-o
house with a
o-o
fireplace.
sentence-next
o-o
And of course
o-o
a back yard,
o-o
or front yard,
o-o
for a dog.
sentence-next
o-o
But it can be
o-o
smaller than a
o-o
Saint Bernard.
sentence-next
o-o
And a
o-o
comfortable car
o-o
for road trips
o-o
and errands.
sentence-next
o-o
And sometimes a
o-o
trip to London
o-o
or Paris,
o-o
and maybe
o-o
other places.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
I thought our plan
o-o
was to sleep in
o-o
on most weekends,
o-o
do activities
o-o
with friends,
o-o
eat healthy food,
o-o
watch some movies,
o-o
and sometimes
o-o
take weekend
o-o
road trips.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Of course
o-o
all of that too.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
And of course
o-o
your mother and I
o-o
want grandchildren.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
If the worlds of
o-o
politics,
o-o
and business,
o-o
and the economy,
o-o
were not so
o-o
upside down,
o-o
then all of that,
o-o
plus a tiara,
o-o
would be within
o-o
our reach.
sentence-next
o-o
But now we're living
o-o
during a time
o-o
of transition.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm afraid
o-o
we could enter
o-o
a new dark age
o-o
if we stay on
o-o
the path we're on.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead I want
o-o
to help make
o-o
the world a
o-o
better place
o-o
for everyone's
o-o
grandkids.
sentence-next
o-o
Even if that means
o-o
I, or we,
o-o
have to make
o-o
a few
o-o
sacrifices.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Oh father, what should
o-o
I do?
sentence-next
o-o
This isn't
o-o
the way I want
o-o
things to be.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
You are my precious
o-o
princess so I'll
o-o
continue to give
o-o
you money if
o-o
that's what it takes
o-o
to keep you happy.
sentence-next
o-o
I'll even help
o-o
support the two of you
o-o
financially
o-o
if that's necessary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
This decision
o-o
puts me in an
o-o
awkward
o-o
position.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The fact that you
o-o
have to think about
o-o
which to choose
o-o
tells me it's
o-o
me who should lose.
sentence-next
o-o
And your father's
o-o
offer of
o-o
financial
o-o
support
o-o
basically
o-o
is bribery
o-o
to distract me
o-o
from the issue
o-o
of corruption.
end-lyric

ambee sings-minister amenn
It's clear to me
o-o
that you love one
o-o
another.
sentence-next

o-o
about your love.
end-lyric

...
o-o
name-vc no-space ,
o-o
I'm not
o-o
including you.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
No offense taken.
sentence-next
o-o
And perhaps you're
o-o
a bit right.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
It's easy
o-o
to find a guy
o-o
who earns
o-o
good money
o-o
stepping on
o-o
people's toes.
sentence-next
o-o
But if he's young
o-o
he'll pick you up
o-o
in a pickup truck
o-o
double parked,
o-o
engine revving,
o-o
and honking
o-o
his horn.
sentence-next
o-o
Young mature men
o-o
are hard to find.
sentence-next
o-o
So do you want
o-o
money or maturity?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
I want both.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
Then it's clear
o-o
you value money
o-o
more than you value
o-o
who I really am.
sentence-next
o-o
I'll clear out my
o-o
things in a few days.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Can we still be friends?

Of course, provided
o-o
I can also remain
o-o
friends with name-desha no-space .
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
Since you won't become
o-o
my son hyphen-here in hyphen-here law
o-o
I won't insist
o-o
on you not being
o-o
friends with this ...
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Skank.
sentence-next
o-o
That's the word
o-o
I think you want.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Father taught me
o-o
long ago that when
o-o
someone criticizes
o-o
another it's
o-o
as if they are
o-o
pointing into
o-o
a mirror.
sentence-next
o-o
Usually
o-o
the critic
o-o
deserves their own
o-o
criticism.
end-lyric

ambee sings-vc amenn
Father, name-minister no-space ,
o-o
you've raised a great
o-o
daughter.
sentence-next
o-o
name-father-of-fiance no-space ,
o-o
after I'm recovered
o-o
we can talk more
o-o
about our project.
sentence-next
o-o
In the meantime,
o-o
I hate awkward
o-o
conversations,
o-o
and misty eyes
o-o
and tears that flow,
o-o
so it's time for
o-o
you,
o-o
name-father-of-fiance no-space ,
o-o
and your daughter
o-o
to go.
