three hyphen-here bedroom
o-o
house with a
o-o
fireplace.
sentence-next
o-o
And of course
o-o
a back yard,
o-o

o-o
for a dog.

smaller than a

comfortable car
o-o
for road trips
o-o
and errands.

I thought our plan

was to enjoy time
o-o
at home eating
o-o
healthy food,
o-o
and relaxing on
o-o
the weekend,
o-o
plus spending
o-o
time with friends.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
Of course
o-o
all of that too.
end-lyric

ambee sings-father-of-fiance amenn
And of course
o-o
your mother and I
o-o
want grandchildren.
end-lyric

If the worlds of
o-o
politics,
o-o
and business,
o-o
and the economy,
o-o
were not so
o-o
upside down,
o-o
then all of that,
o-o
plus a tiara,
o-o
would be within
o-o
our reach.
sentence-next
o-o
But now we're living
o-o
during a time
o-o
of transition.
sentence-next
o-o
I'm afraid
o-o
we could enter
o-o
a new dark age
o-o
if we stay on
o-o
the path we're on.
sentence-next
o-o
Instead I want
o-o
to help make
o-o
the world a
o-o
better place
o-o
for everyone's
o-o
grandkids,
o-o
even if that means
o-o
I, or we,

have to make
o-o
a few
o-o
sacrifices.

o-o
to keep you happy.
sentence-next
o-o
I'll even help
o-o
support the two of you
o-o
financially
o-o
if that's necessary.
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
This puts me in
o-o
an awkward place.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
The fact that you
o-o
have to think about
o-o
which to choose
o-o
tells me it's
o-o
me who should lose.
sentence-next
o-o
And your father's
o-o
offer of
o-o
financial
o-o
support
o-o
basically
o-o
is bribery
o-o
to distract me
o-o
from the issue
o-o
of corruption.
end-lyric

o-o
to find a guy
o-o
who earns
o-o
good money
o-o
stepping on
o-o
people's toes.
sentence-next
o-o
But if he's young
o-o
he'll pick you up
o-o
in a pickup truck
o-o
double parked,
o-o
engine revving,
o-o
and honking
o-o
his horn.
sentence-next
o-o
Young mature men

sentence-next
o-o
So do you want
o-o
money or maturity?
end-lyric

ambee sings-fiance amenn
I want both.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn

o-o
things in a few days.

end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
Father taught me
o-o
long ago that when
o-o
someone criticizes
o-o
another it's
o-o
as if they're
o-o
pointing into
o-o
a mirror.
sentence-next
o-o

o-o
the critic
o-o
deserves their own
o-o
criticism.

entertaining
o-o
drama I've seen
o-o
since high school
o-o
prom night.
sentence-next
o-o

o-o
you two, name-damien
o-o
and name-desha no-space ,
o-o
seem like wonderful
o-o
young people to me.
sentence-next
o-o

o-o
I could use a
o-o
few new friends.
sentence-next
o-o

o-o
or both of you
o-o
want to come and
o-o
visit me at home
o-o
after I'm out
o-o
of this place,
o-o
you're invited.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
I'm beginning
o-o
to see that not

o-o
But I've been told
o-o
I'm a bad hyphen-here ass,
o-o
and that's not going
o-o
to change.
sentence-next
o-o
So unless you like
o-o
being criticized
o-o
for your money quest,
o-o
staying away
o-o
might be best.
end-lyric

ambee sings-damien amenn
As for me,
o-o
probably I

Or handsome.
sentence-next
o-o
As you know I've
o-o
got no money I
o-o
can offer.
end-lyric

ambee sings-desha amenn
The reason Willie
o-o
and I
o-o
are single is
o-o
we don't
o-o
tolerate
o-o
jerks.
sentence-next

And most guys are
o-o
just that, jerks.
sentence-next

a great ass.

eyesight
o-o
examined.
