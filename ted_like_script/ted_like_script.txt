Prosperity Tipping Point
------------------------

When I was a kid I always sat between my sister and brother in the back seat of our family's station wagon. I was the youngest, with the shortest legs, and in that era all cars had a bump in the floor, so that bump was my footrest.

One day, at the beginning of a long road trip, it dawned on me that my legs had reached the floor. I didn't like straddling that bump, and I longed for a window seat. I wanted to look out a window without someone's head blocking my view. So I asked my mom for a window seat.

She sighed and said "OK, let's give it a try." I switched places with my brother because my sister got car sick. At long last my feet had room to move, and I happily stared out the side window with nobody's head obstructing my view.

The experience was glorious. Alas, it ending within a few minutes because my sister and brother started fighting. After my mom told them to stop, she said to me "Do you mind moving back to the middle?" I said "I don't mind now that I know WHY I'm in the middle."

That was the day it dawned on me that I had become a peacekeeper between my sister and brother.

Since then I've been a peacekeeper between housemates, between friends, among neighbors, online, and more.

Now I'm stepping forward to help serve as a peacekeeper for the biggest conflicts around the world.

Yet peace isn't the goal I seek. Peace is just the absense of conflict. I want the OPPOSITE of conflict.

One word for the opposite of conflict is cooperation. Yet even that word doesn't reveal what I really want.

For lack of a better word, I want people to build a sense of community.

I've experienced and enjoyed a sense of community in a variety of situations. In two university towns. In households where we've gone beyond just cooperating and have become friends. Among neighbors even though some combinations of neighbors don't like each other. Yet the best communities have been among social dancers.

Unlike competitive dancing, social dancing involves switching partners after every song or two. At its best, social dancing involves not only dancing with favorites, but also dancing with beginners and less favorites.

As a group we experience a sense of community. Not just cooperation. A spirit of community.

I admit that dancing is a foolish thing to do. It's illogical. We move a lot, yet we get nowhere. At least not physically.

But in spirit, we fly! Our spirits soar!

I don't just seek that joy for myself. Another source of joy comes from dancing in ways that put a smile on the face of the woman I'm dancing with.

What happens in dancing is a huge contrast to the so-call real world.

The world of work. And earning money. And competing for jobs. And businesses competing against similar businesses. And political parties competing for votes.

In this so-called real world, it makes me sad that so many people misunderstand how competition and cooperation really work.

The island of Haiti demonstrates what happens when there is no cooperation. The Haitian government is corrupt. Most citizens in Haiti live in poverty and struggle to survive. They don't volunteer to work cooperatively on worthwhile projects because they know their kindness will be exploited rather than rewarded.

Here in the United States we cooperate more than many people realize.

Within each business there is lots of cooperation. Employees cooperate with each other even when some are Republicans and others are Democrats. And even Protestants, Catholics, Jews, Muslims, Buddists, and agnostics cooperate with each other during working hours.

It's this cooperation WITHIN a business that brings economic prosperity to the business. That prosperity is passed along to employees in the form of higher salaries, to executives in the form of bigger bonuses, and to shareholders in the form of higher values for their share of business ownership.

Some people idealize a competitive spirit. They think it will lead to success. Temporarily it does, especially if they are able to hide their real priorities. Yet time eventually reveals the person's selfishness. That recognition causes people to put up barriers that limit future benefits.

To paraphrase what Abraham Lincoln said, "A business divided cannot stay in business."

A competitive spirit does MOTIVATE people to cooperate. Specifically the competition between businesses motivates an employee to cooperate with other employees in the same business.

At the national level, citizens become wealthier when the citizens cooperate with each other.

As a huge benefit, lots of problems disappear.

Consider the economic prosperity that happened during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States.

That was when our family was taking road trips in our station wagon. Back then I rarely saw homeless people. I seldom heard about drug abuse. And Wikipedia reveals that there were only a couple of school shootings during those two decades.

Instead, practically everyone who wanted a good-paying job could work in a factory or sell products and earn enough money to buy an automobiles and maybe buy a house. Income taxes gave the government plenty of money to build lots of roads and bridges. Businesses demonstrated their wealth by paying for huge elegant buildings in which their employees worked.

Since economic prosperity at the national level has so many benefits, what can be done to cause more of it?

Many people believe that the prosperity in the United States during the 50s and 60s was caused by democracy, or capitalism, or whatever. But actually it mostly arose from luck.

During the first half of the 1900's most of the nations around the world that had factories dropped bombs on each others' factories. But here in the mainland 48 States no factories were bombed. In fact just one bomb was dropped from a balloon released by Japan, and it didn't explode. So when the fighting ended in 1945, nearly everyone around the world, in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, had to buy manufactured products from the United States. Or else Canada, which also was not bombed. Or else Russia, which had most of its factories far from their borders.

So it was a temporary monopoly on working factories that gave us the widespread economic prosperity that we experienced in the United States during the 50s and 60s. That is why people around the world sent us shiploads of money and promised future payments.

By around 1970 that monopoly on factories had ended. New factories had been built. Initially they manufactured essential products needed for rebuilding. Increasingly the factories shifted to making non-essential products sold worldwide. That was when I remember Japan imports such as plastic toys, transistor radios, and eight-track tape players.

But avoiding getting hurt by fighting, and hoping that bullies will leave us alone, is not an effective strategy for reaching sustainable greatness.

A better strategy is to create processes and technologies that improve transportation, communication, and financial transactions. That's the cooperation that will yield huge gains in economic prosperity for regions that implement this strategy.

To appreciate how some seemingly small innovations can yield huge benefits, let's look at a particular tipping point in world history.

I remember learning about the Italian Renaissance. And as a fan of Leonardo da Vinci, I knew that the Medici family in Renaissance Italy earned their money from banking. But I failed to understand what was really going on.

Before big banks came along, highway robbery was a popular profession. This meant that traders had to hire armed guards to protect the gold and silver and precious gems they carried to pay for whatever they were buying. This danger of traveling, and especially trading, between cities is what limited the economic prosperity of all cities.

It's easy for us to forget why highway robbery disappeared. It's not because of highway patrol officers. It's because we now have trustworthy banks that allow us to write paper documents that transfer money in ways that highway robbers cannot exploit.

Since the growth of banks happened relatively suddenly in Italy just before the Italian Renaissance, what changed that allowed banks to grow?

An important innovation was to hire one group of accountants to keep track of debits, and hire a different group of accountants to keep track of credits. This method doubled the work of doing calculations, yet it had a big advantage. This "double-entry" bookkeeping method made it easy to detect the moment a solo employee tried to embezzle money. As a result, family-owned banks were able to hire more employees and grow much bigger.

Also this kind of bookkeeping reduced accidental mistakes, which meant that wealthy people were more likely to trust banks to protect their money. That allowed banks to become bigger.

With bigger banks it became possible to finance bigger trade deals. Remember that was when banks financed the building and sailing of big sailing ships, with the notable goal of finding ways to reach China by ship.

Christian churches in Europe also used the bigger banks to fund the building of impressive cathedrals. I recall staring at a few of those cathedral in awe when I toured Europe after graduating from high school.

Yet beneath these banking innovations, there was an even more important innovation.

Up until the middle ages, people had done counting with counting marks. In most cultures three marks were used to indicate the number three. In Italy the letter V indicated the number five, the letter X indicated ten, and the letter C indicated one hundred. You recognize this writing method as Roman numerals.

Imagine trying to divide two numbers using Roman numerals, such as to calculate interest rates. And imagine using Roman numerals to do both the debit calculations and the credit calculations. Accountants wouldn't just rebel. They would wait in long lines to jump off bridges.

That's why money lenders in Medieval Europe, and earlier, avoided doing division. Instead they used fractions. A fraction is just a way to indicate that one number needs to be divided by another number. Ancient Italians didn't know how to convert fractions into a single number. They learned some clever tricks to add and subtract some fractions. And if they were willing to endure a nightmare, they could multiply two numbers. But division using Roman numerals was literally unthinkable.

The Chinese used a better counting method. They put their counting marks inside of a square. That way an empty square represented the number zero.

The people in India partially copied the Chinese way of writing numbers. But they did not copy the Chinese practice of using the abacus to do calculations. Instead, some genius in India developed a way to do multiplication and division using a process that involved writing numbers using the digits zero through nine. And by using multiplication tables.

This was the monumental innovation that began to propel the world's economy to the prosperity we enjoy today.

Europeans named these digits Arabic numerals. That's because Europeans learned them from Muslims, who speak the Arabic language.

By the way, the reason Muslims learn Arabic is to read the Qu'aran[?], which Mohammed wrote in Arabic. Not just coincidentally, the cooperation of learning the same language was an important part of controlling trade along segments of the Silk Road to China. That's yet another example of cooperation bringing economic prosperity.

If you're thinking that this bit of history about the digits zero through nine is essoteric, then you probably struggled when you studied physics. That's because the biggest challenge in physics is understanding division. Not how to do the calculation. Schools teach that. But what does division really mean?

People who don't understand the concept of division hate physics. Ironically schools even seem to promote this confusion by failing to mention that division is disguised under special names such as ratio, proportion, rate, percent, and the word per.

Division is incredibly important in engineering, science, and especially physics. After Arabic numerals simplified division, what followed was the so-called Scientific Revolution, which happened in the late 1700s. And that was followed by the Industrial Revolution in the late 1700s and early 1800s.

Division also is at the foundation of sending people to the moon, and bringing them back, building big bridges, building ever-better automobiles, building computers and the internet, developing vaccines, calculating interest rates, and countless other miracles of our so-called "modern" age.

It was a thousand years ago that these digits entered Europe. They were being taught in an Islamic university in North Africa just across from Spain. A student there named Gerbert of Aurillac learned how to calculate using these digits. Then in the year 999 he became the Pope in Rome, where he became known as Pope Sylvestor the Second.

Pope Sylvestor could do multiplication and division much faster than the other Romans because he used Arabic numbers, and they were still using Roman numerals.

We would expect that the digits zero through nine would have been welcomed as an obvious improvement. Instead some Medieval Christian Churchs in Italy declared the use of Arabic numerals to be a sin. Some European kings and monarchs declared them illegal to use.

So imagine going back to those days and asking a Roman "Why do you object to using Arabic numerals?" Some Romans would say "We already have words and symbols for counting from zero to ten." Others would be intimidated by the hassle of learning how to use multiplication tables. And some of them basically would say "The Arabic speaking people in Africa and the Middle East are our enemy, so what they like, we don't like."

For these reasons, plus limitations on publishing non-religious books, it took two centuries -- that's 200 years -- until the first European book about Arabic numerals was published. It was written by another Leonardo, this one from Pisa. Today he is known by the name Fibonacci.

We laugh at the foolishness of Romans who dismissed the digits zero through nine for 200 years.

Yet right now we're doing something similar.

Future generations will laugh at our collective foolishness. Especially because the counting method we are failing to adopt has been known since the 1600s. And it's been explained in books that were written in the 1700s. And academic journals have described it many times in the 1900s.

Ironically it doesn't have a well-known name. That's typical for things that are new.

As an example of lacking a name for a future innovation, when I was a teenager my brother and father asked me why I didn't want to buy a camera. That was back when all cameras were film cameras. I said "I'm waiting for the electronic kind." They couldn't imagine what I was talking about. I tried to explain it in terms of black and white television cameras, which did exist, but that didn't help. If I had know their future name and said "I'm waiting for digital cameras," that would not have helped.

So, lacking an official name, I'll refer to this important counting innovation as "pairwise vote counting."

The concept of "pairwise" is already well-known in the world of team sports. Each team can only play against one other team, one pair of teams at a time. That's what the word pairwise means.

As a geek with a degree in physics I'd love to explain how pairwise vote counting works. But that's not my goal here. Anyway, you don't need to learn how to do pairwise counting. You just need to learn enough to allow computers to do pairwise counting.

Perhaps some people are thinking that the word "vote" in pairwise vote counting is too political. And that we already have enough conflict in politics.

Yes, politics involves way too much conflict, the way it's done now. Pairwise vote counting would dramatically reduce that conflict. And the resulting cooperation would dramatically increase economic prosperity.

On our election ballots, the ones we use now, we are allowed to mark just one candidate for each political position. That preference information is so limited that there is only one way to count that kind of ballot. It's called "plurality" counting. Or in some English speaking nations it's called "first past the post" counting.

Instead we as voters should be allowed to mark a ballot to indicate our first choice, our second choice, third choice, and so on. That's easy to learn to do. It's called ranking. It's like prioritizing, which every functioning adult has to learn.

Computers can do pairwise vote counting if we rank candidates on a ranked-choice ballot.

Unlike some other vote-counting methods that are more familiar, pairwise vote counting looks deeply into the preference information that's marked on a ranked-choice ballot. This deep look makes it possible to correctly identify which candidate is really most popular.

How will this simple change lead to economic prosperity?

Imagine the economy as a cherry pie. If someone cuts a big piece of that pie there is less pie avaiable for everyone else.

This is what many wealthy people do. They use money to control politicians to write laws that give big advantages to a very profitable business they own. That ownership can be either as a family business or as a shareholder who owns shares of a corporation.

Those laws increase the profit of the business. For example laws that cause healthcare to be unnecessarily expensive motivate employees to accept lower salaries because these people cannot afford to directly, as an individual, buy health insurance. And such laws can force consumers to pay higher prices for inferior products. Often these methods of force involve court cases where the side that can afford better lawyers almost always wins.

This greed would not be a big deal if it were limited to just a few businesses giving themselves a large slice of economic pie. That would still leave plenty of economic pie for the rest of us. Alas, lots and lots of businesses give themselves large slices of economic pie. That excessive greed by too many wealthy business owners is what causes the rest of us to suffer economically.

For example, when pharmacutical companies overcharge for medications, when health insurance companies overcharge for health insurance, when cable companies overcharge for entertainment, and when phone companies overcharge for cell phone service, the combined effect is dramatically less economic pie for those of us who are consumers of these products and services.

All that excessive greed drains prosperity from our economy.

In other words, we have an election system that rewards campaign contributors more than voters. That motivates politicians to pass laws that hurt consumers and help businesses, especially large businesses.

As an example, businesses that make artificial sweeteners have paid politicians to pass laws against a grocery store displaying the herb stevia near the shelves that display artificial sweeteners and sugar. And owners of sugar refineries pay politicians to make it illegal to buy sugar that's not grown and refined in the United States, which greatly increases how much US citizens pay for sugar compared to elsewhere around the world.

Why does money have more influence than votes?

Getting outvoted by money happens because we use election counting methods that are as primitive as Roman numerals.


A lack of trust arises when there is competition instead of cooperation.

Everyone, rich and poor and middle class, would benefit if we spent more of our money to pay musicians to create music, pay restaurants to cook food, and ....

Consider what now happens. Businesses fight each other in court. That's conflict. And conflicts waste valuable resources. The economy would benefit if young people who want a good-paying career choose to become software developers or engineers or scientists instead of lawyers. That's a waste of brainpower.

These fights are superimposed on the fight between political parties.

You probably recognize that both the Republican party and the Democratic party are becoming less and less appreciated by voters. That's because both parties are heavily controlled by the people who give the biggest amounts of money to their candidates.

That reveals an even bigger fight. The fight in which votes compete against money. Alas, using the current vote-counting method money wins almost every time.

A very important tactic in this fight is to exploit the fact that only one Republican candidate and only one Democratic candidate reaches the general election. Unlike those of us who must choose to cast a vote in only one party's primary election or the other party's primary election, the wealthiest people give money to candidates in both parties during the primary election. That tactic is used to block the candidates who want the reforms that most voters want.

A dramatic example of this blocking tactic happened in 2008 when wealthy people who wanted a Republican president gave money to Barak Obama to block Hillary Clinton from reaching the general election. The blocking part of their tactic worked. But they failed to understand that racism has declined and was not sufficient to cause the Republican candidate to win.

Hopefully you can see a glimmer of the future in which votes have more influence than money in politics. And hopefully you see that when we reach higher levels of democracy then laws can be passed that favor the majority of us who are not wealthy.

This change will be similar to what happened in history shortly before Arabic numerals were adopted in Europe. That was the time of the Black Death. The combination of farm workers dying and farmland becoming available caused the end of serfdom. That's because farm workers could walk down the road to a different farm where the land owner gave them better working conditions, lower taxes, and possibly better housing. Plus, the Medieval Christian church lost credibility because their priests were not able to cure the disease, and their priests died from saying last-rite prayers over the body of the deceased.

We don't yet know all the implications of the current Covid19 pandemic. Yet already it is causing lots of voters to realize that politics as usual is not yielding solutions to school shootings, and climate change.

Having written a how-to book on creative problem solving I can assure you that solutions exist for even the biggest problems we face.

Alas, I can't name those solutions. Those names don't yet exist.

As an example, when I was a teenager, my brother and father asked me why I didn't want a camera. At that time all cameras were film cameras. I said I was waiting for the electronic kind of camera. They had no clue what I was talking about. If I had known in advance that electronic cameras would become known as digital cameras, that would not have made it easier to understand.

In a similar way, perhaps what I'm calling pairwise vote counting will be named something different in the future. We can't know. We don't yet have time machines that go forward in time. We only have the time machines called history books that take us back in time.

Yet I'm certain that the economic prosperity that followed the adoption of the digits zero through nine is a pattern that will be repeated when we finally adopt better ways to count votes.

...

Just as Europeans centuries ago were slow to realize that adopting the digits zero through nine would lead to huge increases in economic prosperity, we, those of us living now, are slow to realize that adopting pairwise vote counting will lead to huge increases in economic prosperity.

...

We can fly. We can create wonderous communities. We can lead lives that are less like fighting and more like dancing.

We want to build a huge, worldwide community based on cooperation instead of fighting.

Adopting pairwise vote counting for our elections will take us to that dramatically prosperous future.

...

The wealth to pay for non-essential things like paintings, statues, and music arose because of innovations in banking, which led to bigger and more trustworthy banks.

Part of the reason you haven't heard about it is that most new knowledge about math comes from academic professors who do research that's funded by their government. But what government is going to fund research about better ways to vote?

This lack of funding to study better vote-counting methods results in very few articles in academic journals. In turn, Wikipedia does not have up-to-date information about this subject because Wikipedia editors reject math information that isn't backed up by academic journal articles.

What evidence supports the idea that elections are unfair? Most voters are frustrated by all the candidates listed on our ballot.

Through written articles, opinions voiced at political events, and sometimes in protests we express our dissatisfaction with both the Republican and Democratic parties.

This conflict between voters and the biggest campaign contributors is what I'm stepping forward to solve.

I'm not growing tired of playing the role of peacekeeper. But I am getting tired of waiting for better cooperation, and less fighting. I want a window seat.

Our current vote-counting methods are easily exploited in ways that involve money.

I want you to imagine a future in which bright young people are attracted to become technology designers instead of being attracted by money to become lawyers. We can do that by changing laws that currently tax law firms the same as software firms. And we can make lots of other changes for the better because current attitudes about conflict cause bankers to be more rewarded than public school teachers.

I want you to imagine our nation as a cooperative community, where fairer voting leads to fairer laws, and fairer laws lead to widespread economic prosperity, and widespread economic prosperity leads to another Renaissance in art, music, dance, movies with lower years-in-prison ratings, and spirited [...].

I've been blessed to get a window seat where I can see the future. We don't need to let immature impulses guide our behavior.

We are happy when people build valuable businesses and earn lots of money from that business. But we are unhappy when people overcharge and underpay and exploit our currently primitive elections to protect laws that force the opposite, low pay and high prices.

I now get a window seat every time I drive. And I get to see the road ahead. And what I see is that future generations will enjoy widespread economic prosperity, much less warfare, a huge middle class, less economic suffering, fewer lawyers, and incredibly beautiful music.

Our current voting methods in use around the world, including in Europe and Australia and New Zealand, are primitive. All of us, in at least some elections, when we vote, we can only mark a single choice from among a list of choices.

Just two or three decades ago when computers arrived we could have adopted a counting method that would increase the world's economic prosperity as dramatically as Arabic numerals increased Europe's economic prosperity.

And consider that along with more trade and commerce, less fighting results in less money being spent on healing injuries and repairing damage.

Trust is a key part of cooperating. Today we benefit from trust among strangers on the roads between cities. They are less likely to be highway robbers. Lengths of fabric and bulk foods in bags are more likely to be measured fairly. The goods sold by weight, what we now call "per pound," are more likely to be priced at the advertised price per weight.

Currently civilization is still quite primitive. I've glimpsed some future innovations that will take us from current states of homelessness, widespread poverty, mass shootings, foolish wars, and annoying ads.

Here's one future innovation. It's a way to reduce crime. Currently young people learn about crime from movies, TV shows, computer games, and [...] YouTube videos. I suggest that we add another rating to movies and computer games. The added movie and game rating would indicate how many years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown on the screen.

Employees must accept low wages to get affordable health insurance.

If politicians stop protecting these corrupt laws, wealthy business owners will stop funding their election campaigns.
