"TED" talk script for video
---------------------------

When I was a kid I always sat between my sister and brother in the back seat of our family's station wagon. Back in those days the car's floor had a bump to make room for the shaft that connected the rear wheels to the engine in the front. That bump was my footrest for my short legs.

One day, at the beginning of a long road trip, it dawned on me that my legs had reached the floor. It was a hassle to straddle that bump. And I longed for a window seat. I was tired of seeing heads between me and the view out the windows. So I asked my mom for a window seat.

She sighed and said "OK, let's give it a try." My sister got car sick, so I switched places with my brother. At long last my patience was rewarded. My feet had room to move around. And I happily stared out the window with nobody's head obstructing my view.

That lasted for a few glorious ... minutes. That's all it took for my sister and brother to start fighting. So my mom said "Do you mind moving back to the middle?" I said "I don't mind now that I know WHY I'm in the middle."

That was the day it dawned on me that I was a peacekeeper between my sister and brother. What I learned being a peacekeeper has been very useful.

Since then I've played the role of peacekeeper between college housemates, among friends, among neighbors, online, and more.

Now I'm stepping forward to serve as a peacekeeper for conflicts around the world.

Yet peace isn't the goal I seek. Peace is just the absense of conflict. I want the OPPOSITE of conflict.

The opposite of conflict is cooperation. Yet even the word cooperation doesn't reveal what I really want.

For lack of a better word, I want people to build a sense of community.

One kind of community I've experienced and enjoyed is the feeling of a university town where troublemakers and fighters are easily expelled or locked up because they so strongly contrast with academic-minded folks.

Even better has been a sense of community among a small group of people. Sometimes it's happened in a household where we go beyond just cooperating for selfish reasons. Sometimes I've experienced a sense of community among friends. Sometimes even among neighbors. Yet my fondest recollections come from the sense of community that arises among non-competitive social dancers.

Social dancers cooperate because we deeply understand that we can reach higher levels of spiritual experience.

I admit that dancing is a foolish thing to do. It's illogical. We move a lot, yet we get nowhere. At least not physically.

But in spirit, we fly! That's a most wonderful experience. Flying in spirit.

Yet I don't just seek that goal for myself. Part of the joy is dancing in ways that put a smile on the face of the woman I'm dancing with.

Dancing contrasts with the regular world. The world of work. And earning money. And competing for jobs. And businesses competing with similar businesses. And there's the world of government and politics where it's more profitable to compete than to cooperate.

Yet consider that within a business there are dramatic levels of cooperation. People with conflicting religions and conflicting political views put aside those conflicts while at work. That's what brings economic prosperity to the business. And a prosperous business pays a higher wage. And higher wages reduce suffering, and reduce anger, and reduce the urge to conflict in other areas of life.

I grew up during a time of great economic prosperity, the 1950s and 1960s. Compared to now, few people were homeless, drug use was far less common than now, and school shootings were extremely rare. Practically everyone who wanted a good-paying job working in a factory or selling products had a good-paying job. Back then, automobiles were affordable, buying a house was affordable for the middle class, and even then it was clear that gasoline was ridiculously cheap. And there was money to build roads and bridges and big buildings, which sadly are now among the ones that are long overdue for repairs.

The cause of that prosperity is easy to misunderstand. Some people claim that it arose because of democracy, or capitalism, or whatever. But actually it was just luck.

During the first half of the 1900's all the nations that had factories, except the United States and Canada, bombed the factories in nearby nations. Yet here in North America only one bomb was dropped, and it didn't explode. So when the fighting ended, people througout Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East had to buy manufactured products from the United States and Canada. Or else from Russia because they too had unbombed factories.

So that widespread economic prosperity of the 50s and 60s was a result of luck. But relying on luck, and trying to simply remain at peace, is not a wise strategy for achieving economic prosperity.

A much better strategy is to do what leads to big gains in economic prosperity for most people in a region.

To see a good example of how that works, let's look farther back into history.

A time of great prosperity was what we call the Italian Renaissance. It's obvious from the name that it was happening in Italy. That was back when Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa. And Michaelangelo sculpted the statue of David. And the violin was invented.

Just before the Italian Renaissance there was a huge surge in economic prosperity in Italy. That's why money was available to pay for non-essential things like paintings, statues, and music.

That prosperity arose because of innovations in banking.

Banking in itself reduced highway robbery. That's because travellers increasingly carried papers with writing that were worthless to anyone who stole them. That eliminated the need for travellers to carry gold and silver and precious gems to purchase things. Home burglary was another profession that dwindled as banks grew because a family's wealth could be stored at a bank.

Part of the reason banking grew beyond reliance on trustworthy single families is that double-entry bookkeeping was used. This means that some accountants kept track of debits, and other accountants kept track of credits. If the final numbers of the debits and credits didn't match, an "audit" investigation could uncover embezzlement.

(What's the big deal about double-entry bookkeeping? It makes it very difficult for employees to embezzle money. That's because the accountants who keep track of debits are different from the accountants who keep track of credits. An embezzler who is involved in only one of those kinds of accounting will cause the debits and credits to not match, and that triggers an audit.)

Bigger banks made it possible to finance bigger trade deals, bigger construction projects, and bigger [other cooperative activities]. In hindsight, of special significance was that bigger banks financed big sailing ships seeking to bypass the trade monopoly along the Silk Road to China.

Yet there was an even bigger innovation at the core of banking innovations.

Ealier in history people had done counting with counting marks. For example, three marks indicated the number three. And when you got to five marks you can summarize that with the letter V. And X means ten. And the letter C means one hundred. You remember learning those as the Roman numerals that Italy used during the Middle Ages.

The Chinese used a better method. They put counting marks inside of squares. That way they could represent the number zero as an empty square.

In nearby India they adopted that idea of having a placeholder where otherwise there would be a count. But they didn't use the abacus for calculations like the Chinese did, so some genius invented a way to multiply and divide using an early version of what we now recognize as the digits zero through nine.

Imagine trying to divide two numbers using Roman numerals. If banks hired accountants to do that kind of math there would be long lines of accountants waiting in line to jump off bridges.

Being able to do division on paper was a huge innovation. If you remember suffering through learning how to calculate using fractions, you know what I mean. A fraction is a division calculation that hasn't yet been done. During the days of Roman numerals that's how they avoided doing division.

If you wonder what's so important about division, you probably struggled when you learned physics. The biggest challenge in physics is understanding division. Not how to do the calculation, but what it means. Unfortunately schools make it even harder by disguising division using the words ratio, proportion, rate, percent, and the word per. Those are just special kinds of division.

Hopefully it's now dawning on you that sending people to the moon and getting them back, and building big bridges, and building ever-better automobiles, and developing vaccines, and much more technology relies on division.

That means that when the digits zero through nine arrived in Rome they made it possible to do double-entry bookkeeping, measurements of things both big and small, weighing and counting items being bought or sold, and so much more.

So you would expect that Rome embraced the arrival of those digits, right? Sadly, the opposite happened.

Some rulers made it illegal to use the digits zero through nine. The Christian church, which was centered in Rome under the Pope, regarded their use as a sin. And it didn't help that those digits were named Arabic numerals. And that they had arrived from the Muslim world, which earned lots of money from Europeans who bought luxury items from China and earned money by selling products that the Chinese wanted.

A key turning point for Europe was when a man named [?] learned to use the digits zero through nine while he was a student in an Islamic university that a wealthy Muslim widow had funded alongside the Islamic house of worship that she also funded. That was in North Africa, not far from Spain. In the year 999 he became the Pope in Rome. At that time Romans were still using Roman numerals. So he could do multiplication and division much faster.

You might expect that immediately the advantages of using the digits zero through nine was obvious, and that they would be quickly adopted. Not so. It took another 200 [?] years before books about the calculations were written and published. A friend of Leaonardo da Vinci was one of those authors.

It took another two centuries before Leonardo of Pisa, who is known to us as Fibonacci, published the first European book that explained how to use the digits zero through nine.

Along with the invention of printing using moveable type, that book made it possible for lots of people to learn how to do calculations using those digits. With that training wealthy families could hire accountants. That was the family business of the Medici family in Florence. They were the wealthy people who employed Leonardo da Vinci.



Banking led to more trade and commerce, which are forms of cooperation. That means there is less fighting. In turn that leads to less money wasted on repairing damage that's caused by fighting. And less money wasted on healthcare for healing injuries caused by physical fighting.

Notice that a simple innovation in counting, namely the digits zero through nine and the process of using them, led to huge increases in economic prosperity for the trading centers of Europe.

A similar pattern is going on now. But it gets so little attention.


A simple innovation called pairwise vote counting is waiting for us to adopt. That simple counting method will transform elections into the form of communication that they were intended to be.

Remember that voting is supposed to be how voters communicate their desires to leaders.

Alas, we use election counting methods that are as primitive as Roman numerals.

And just as Europeans centuries ago were slow to realize that adopting the digits zero through nine would lead to huge increases in economic prosperity, we, those of us living now, are slow to realize that adopting pairwise vote counting will lead to huge increases in economic prosperity.

What's the link between a better vote-counting method and increased economic prosperity?

Imagine changing corrupt laws that currently allow large corporations to take more money from your wallet than you would have to pay if we had fairer laws.

Imagine ....

I'm a geek, so I'd love to show you how pairwise vote counting works. Yet when I try to explain it, the typical reaction is that it's essoteric.

Yet the digits zero through nine were essoteric to Europeans who did calculations using Roman numerals. It's only in hindsight that the importance becomes clear.

So instead I'm choosing to focus on my role as a peacekeeper.

I want you to understand that way too much time and money and resources are wasted when we don't communicate clearly.

I want you to imagine a future in which bright young people are attracted to become technology designers instead of being attracted by money to become lawyers. We can do that by changing laws that currently tax law firms the same as software firms. And we can make lots of other changes for the better because current attitudes about conflict cause bankers to be more rewarded than public school teachers.

I want you to imagine our nation as a cooperative community, where fairer voting leads to fairer laws, and fairer laws lead to widespread economic prosperity, and widespread economic prosperity leads to another Renaissance in art, music, dance, movies with lower years-in-prison ratings, and spirited [...].

I've been blessed to get a window seat where I can see the future. We don't need to let immature impulses guide our behavior.

We can fly. We can create wonderous communities. We can lead lives that are less like fighting and more like dancing.

What stops us is a failure to appreciate that pairwise vote counting is already beginning to provide a bridge that will take us to that prosperous future.

That future is waiting for any region or nation that spreads the innovation of pairwise vote counting as a better way to improve what we call voting.

Voting is now primitive. Let's change it. Let's make sure that politicians hear us voters loudly and clearly.

And the message we want them to listen to is that we want laws to change from forcing us, as employees and customers, to work for cheap and buy at inflated prices.

We are happy when people build valuable businesses and earn lots of money from that business. But we are unhappy when people overcharge and underpay and exploit our currently primitive elections to protect laws that force the opposite, low pay and high prices.

We want to build a huge, worldwide community based on cooperation instead of fighting.

Adopting better vote-counting methods will get us there.

I'm not growing tired of playing the role of peacekeeper. But I am getting tired of waiting for better cooperation, less fighting, so I can get a window seat.

I now get a window seat every time I drive. And I get to see the road ahead. And what I see is that future generations will enjoy widespread economic prosperity, much less warfare, a huge middle class, less economic suffering, fewer lawyers, and incredibly beautiful music.

Extra paragraphs:

Currently civilization is still quite primitive. I've glimpsed some future innovations that will take us from current states of homelessness, widespread poverty, mass shootings, foolish wars, and annoying ads.

Politics is very unlike dancing. There is lots of conflict in the world of politics. And there is lots of corruption. 

We tend to think we are so advanced because we use voting to allow citizens to control government actions. Yet clearly money has more influence than votes.

This conflict between voters and the biggest campaign contributors is what I'm stepping forward to solve.

Here's one future innovation. It's a way to reduce crime. Currently young people learn about crime from movies, TV shows, computer games, and [...] YouTube videos. I suggest that we add another rating to movies and computer games. The added movie and game rating would indicate how many years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown on the screen.

Now that you know I'm naive, I can share an even bigger innovation that will spread peace worldwide.

Employees must accept low wages to get affordable health insurance.

If politicians stop protecting these corrupt laws, wealthy business owners will stop funding their election campaigns.
