"TED" talk script for video
---------------------------

When I was a kid I always sat between my sister and brother in the back seat of our family's station wagon. Back in those days the car's floor had a bump to make room for the shaft that connected the rear wheels to the engine in the front. I was the youngest, with the shortest legs, so that bump was my footrest.

One day, at the beginning of a long road trip, it dawned on me that my legs had reached the floor. It was a hassle to straddle that bump. Also, I longed for a window seat. I was tired of four heads blocking my view out the windows. So I asked my mom for a window seat.

She sighed and said "OK, let's give it a try." My sister got car sick, so I switched places with my brother. At long last my patience was rewarded. My feet had room to move around. And I happily stared out the window with nobody's head obstructing my view.

That lasted for a few glorious ... minutes. That's all it took for my sister and brother to start fighting. After telling them to stop, my mom said to me "Do you mind moving back to the middle?" I said "I don't mind now that I know WHY I'm in the middle."

That was the day it dawned on me that I was a peacekeeper between my sister and brother.

What I learned back then as a peacekeeper has been useful in my role as peacekeeper between college housemates, among friends, among neighbors, online, and more.

Now I'm stepping forward to help serve as a peacekeeper for the biggest conflicts around the world.

Yet peace isn't the goal I seek. Peace is just the absense of conflict. I want the OPPOSITE of conflict.

One word for the opposite of conflict is cooperation. Yet even that word doesn't reveal what I really want.

For lack of a better word, I want people to build a sense of community.

One kind of community I've experienced and enjoyed is the feeling of a university town where troublemakers and fighters are easily expelled or locked up because they so strongly contrast with academic-minded folks.

Even better has been a sense of community among a small group of people. Sometimes it's happened in a household where we become friends and go far beyond just cooperating for selfish reasons. Sometimes I've experienced a sense of community among friends who share an interest or activity. I've even helped to grow a sense of community among neighbors. Yet my fondest recollections come from the sense of community that arises among non-competitive social dancers.

Social dancers cooperate because we deeply understand that we can reach higher levels of spiritual experience.

I admit that dancing is a foolish thing to do. It's illogical. We move a lot, yet we get nowhere. At least not physically.

But in spirit, we fly! That's a most wonderful experience. Flying in spirit.

Yet I don't just seek the goal of flying in spirit for myself. Part of my joy comes from putting a smile on the face of the woman I'm dancing with. That makes my spirit soar even higher.

Dancing is a big contrast with the regular world. The world of work. And earning money. And competing for jobs. And businesses competing with similar businesses. And political parties competing for votes. In those parts of life, alas, under current conditions, many people believe that competing yields more profit than cooperating.

Yet consider that within a business there are dramatic levels of cooperation. Employees who work for the same business yet who believe in conflicting religions put aside those conflicts while at work. The most profitable businesses hire both Republicans and Democrats, and they fire employees who cannot put aside political conflicts while at work. It's that cooperation WITHIN the business that brings economic prosperity to the business.

Very significantly, that cooperation is rewarded with money. It comes in the form of higher salaries and higher stock prices.

In turn, prosperity reduces suffering, it reduces anger, and it reduces the urge to conflict in other areas of life.

To better appreciate the connection between less conflict and more prosperity, consider the time of great economic prosperity in the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. I was a youngster back then so I remember that, compared to now, fewer people were homeless, drug use was much less common, and there were only a couple of school shootings during those two decades. Back then, practically everyone who wanted a good-paying job working in a factory or selling products had a good-paying job. Back then, automobiles were affordable, buying a house was affordable for the middle class, and even then it was clear that gasoline was ridiculously cheap. And back then there was money to build lots of roads and bridges and big buildings.

The cause of that prosperity is easy to misunderstand. Some people believe the prosperity was caused by democracy, or capitalism, or whatever. But actually it arose from luck.

During the first half of the 1900's most of the nations that had factories got their factories destroyed by bombs dropped from enemy aircraft. But in the contiguous 48 States only one enemy bomb was dropped, and it didn't explode. Canada and most of Russia too were spared from getting their factories bombed. So when the fighting ended, people througout Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East had to buy manufactured products from the United States and Canada and Russia.

That temporary monopoly on working factories is what created the widespread economic prosperity for the United States and Canada during the 50s and 60s. People throughout the world were sending us boatloads of money and valuable items to pay for products manufactured in North America.

Of course that monopoly didn't last. Factories around the world now compete with US and Canadian factories.

Relying on luck is not a wise strategy for achieving economic prosperity. Or for hoping it will last.

A much better strategy is to do what leads to big gains in economic prosperity for most people in a region.

A good example of that better strategy is what happened just before the Italian Renaissance. That was a time of widespread economic prosperity for Italy. That was when wealthy business owners, including the Medici family, paid Leonardo da Vinci to paint masterpieces, the best known of which are his Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. And those wealthy patrons paid Michaelangelo to sculpt the statue of David and amazing statues for their tombs. And that was when the violin was invented and became part of symphonic music.

Why was there so much prosperity that money was available to pay for non-essential things like paintings, statues, and music?

Much of that wealth arose because of innovations in banking. Why did banking matter?

Before big banks came along, trade between cities required carrying gold and silver and precious gems to pay for whatever the traders were buying. To protect themselves on those travels, traders had to hire armed guards. When banks became big enough and trustworthy enough, only paper documents needed to be carried to record the transfers of wealth. That innovation eventually ended the profession of highway robbery.

What enabled banks to become bigger than just a single banker or a banking family?

An important innovation was double-entry bookkeeping. This sounds like it's not a big deal. Yet this change made it much more difficult for employees to embezzle money. That's because the accountants who keep track of debits were different from the accountants who kept track of credits. An embezzler working alone would cause the debits and credits to not match. That would trigger an audit to uncover either a careless accountant or an embezzler.

With bigger banks, it became practical to finance bigger trade deals, bigger construction projects, and of course the big sailing ships that searched for a way to bypass the trade monopoly along the Silk Road to China.

Yet beneath this innovation was an even more important innovation.

Ealier in history people had done counting with counting marks. For example, three marks indicated the number three. When you got to five marks you could summarize that with the letter V. And X means ten. And the letter C means one hundred. Hopefully you recognize these symbols as Roman numerals. That's what Italy was using during the Middle Ages. That was a huge barrier to the growth of banking.

The Chinese used a better counting method. They put their counting marks inside of a square. That way an empty square represented the number zero.

That innovation alone was not the big deal. Everybody who could write, could write words that meant "none," and "nobody," and even "zero."

The big innovation happened in nearby India. They didn't use the abacus for calculations like the Chinese did. Instead they did calculations by writing. So someone in India invented a way to write the digits zero through nine. And some genius in India, possibly the same person, invented ways to multiply and divide these numbers. That was the big innovation that propelled the world's economy to the prosperity we enjoy today.

To appreciate the importance of the digit zero, imagine trying to divide two numbers using Roman numerals. If accountants had to do that kind of math, there would be long lines of accountants waiting in line to jump off bridges.

To further appreciate this innovation, recall in school when you learned to add and subtract fractions. Yeah, instant headache. That's what the Romans had been doing. They left division problems unsolved, and just wrote the number as a fraction. They learned clever tricks for working with fractions, but those tricks are not useful in most people's professions today.

At this point you're probably thinking that this bit of history is essoteric.

If so, you probably struggled when you learned physics. That's because the biggest challenge in physics is understanding division. Not how to do the calculation. Schools teach that. But what does division really mean?

The people who don't understand the concept of division hate physics. Ironically schools even promote this confusion by failing to mention that division is disguised under special names such as ratio, proportion, rate, percent, and the word per.

Division is at the foundation of sending people to the moon, and bringing them back, building big bridges, building ever-better automobiles, developing vaccines, and countless other miracles of our so-called "modern" age.

Alas, when the digits zero through nine arrived in Rome they were not just thought of as essoteric. Medieval Christian Churchs declared using them a sin. And laws against their use led to people being punished for using those digits.

Even today there are people who say we should not teach "Arabic numerals" in public schools. That's the modern name for the digits zero through nine.

The name comes from the fact that Europeans learned about the digits and calculation methods from the Arabic-speaking Muslims who controlled the Silk Road that linked Europe to China. That trade benefitted Europeans who bought silks and porcelain, and it benefitted the Chinese who bought products made in Europe.

Muslims in many regions of the Middle East and North Africa were able to cooperate more easily because they learned the Arabic language so they could read the [Qu'aran?] written by Mohammed. As a result of this cooperation, the people along the Silk Road became very wealthy from this two-way trade.

A key turning point for Europe happened in North Africa, just across from Spain, where a wealthy Muslim widow had funded an Islamic university alongside the Islamic mosque that she also funded. One of the students at that university was a man named Gerbert of Aurillac. He learned to use the digits zero through nine. In the year 999 he became the Pope in Rome. He became Pope Sylvestor the Second.

At that time Romans were still using Roman numerals. So Pope Sylvestor could do multiplication and division much faster.

You might expect that the advantages of using the digits zero through nine was rather obvious. And that they would be adopted quickly. Nope.

It took another two centuries -- that's 200 years -- before Leonardo of Pisa, who is known to us as Fibonacci, published the first European book that explained how to use the digits zero through nine. Later, yet another popular book on the topic was written by a friend of Leaonardo da Vinci.

Hopefully you now appreciate that a seemingly simple innovation in counting and numbers led to bigger banks, which in turn led to more trade and commerce. Keep in mind that trade and commerce are forms of cooperation. So this is the link I want you to understand:

Cooperation brings prosperity.

Of course back then there was still some fighting, but it was less than before. There was an economic benefit from fewer assaults for the purpose of robbery, and fewer burlaries. Less money was spent on repairing damage and healing injuries caused by those crimes.

Trust also increased. There was more trust of strangers on the roads between cities. There was more trust that money transfers were fair. There was more trust that lengths of fabric were measured fairly. There was more trust that goods sold by weight, what we would call "per pound" now, were weighed accurately and priced fairly.

Now you see that a seemingly tiny change in counting can lead to a dramatically widespread increase in economic prosperity.

So now you are ready to understand the importance of a seemingly tiny change in counting that is going on now.

The next huge innovation that will lead to dramatic increases in economic prosperity is called "pairwise vote counting."

At this moment you may be thinking "That sounds essoteric." Remember that's the same reaction that greeted people who suggested using Arabic numerals a thousand years ago.

Or maybe you're thinking "We already know how to count." That would be like a Medieval Roman saying "We don't need the digit zero because we already have words for zero."

Or maybe you're thinking "We get along fine with the counting methods we already have." That would be like ancient Romans saying "What's wrong with Roman numerals? They work fine for addition and subtraction. And we get along fine using fractions instead of division."

Or maybe you're thinking "Pairwise, that sounds exotic, and difficult to learn." That would be like ancient Romans saying "If I have to read an entire book to use these new-fangled digit things, that's too much work."

Yet the concept of pairwise is simple. We already do pairwise contests in the world of team sports. Each team can only play against one other team, one pair of teams at a time. That's what the word pairwise means.

The key word in "pairwise vote counting" is the word "vote."

Our current voting methods in use around the world, including in Europe and Australia and New Zealand, are primitive. Most of us, when we vote, can only mark a single choice from among a list of choices.

That preference information is so limited that there is only one way to count those ballots.

And that counting method, which is called "plurality" counting, or sometimes "first past the post" counting, is vulnerable to being exploited in ways that involve money.

Perhaps you believe there are lots of simple-minded voters who are swayed by political ads. I won't disagree that some voters are simple-minded. Yet most of us voters are not swayed by those ads. Instead we are frustrated that we don't really like any of the candidates listed on the ballot.

That lack of politicians who are free to pass the laws we want passed happens because our current vote-counting methods are easily exploited in ways that involve money.

We tend to think we are so advanced because we use voting to allow citizens to control government actions. Yet clearly money has more influence than votes.

It happens because we use election counting methods that are as primitive as Roman numerals.

This conflict between voters and the biggest campaign contributors is what I'm stepping forward to solve.

Voting is now primitive. Let's change it in ways that ensure politicians hear us voters loudly and clearly.

Just as Europeans centuries ago were slow to realize that adopting the digits zero through nine would lead to huge increases in economic prosperity, we, those of us living now, are slow to realize that adopting pairwise vote counting will lead to huge increases in economic prosperity.

What's the link between a better vote-counting method and increased economic prosperity?

Imagine changing corrupt laws that currently allow large corporations to take more money from your wallet than you would have to pay if we had fairer laws.

I want you to imagine a future in which bright young people are attracted to become technology designers instead of being attracted by money to become lawyers. We can do that by changing laws that currently tax law firms the same as software firms. And we can make lots of other changes for the better because current attitudes about conflict cause bankers to be more rewarded than public school teachers.

I want you to imagine our nation as a cooperative community, where fairer voting leads to fairer laws, and fairer laws lead to widespread economic prosperity, and widespread economic prosperity leads to another Renaissance in art, music, dance, movies with lower years-in-prison ratings, and spirited [...].

I've been blessed to get a window seat where I can see the future. We don't need to let immature impulses guide our behavior.

We can fly. We can create wonderous communities. We can lead lives that are less like fighting and more like dancing.

What stops us is a failure to appreciate that pairwise vote counting is already beginning to provide a bridge that will take us to that prosperous future.

That future is waiting for any region or nation that spreads the innovation of pairwise vote counting as a better way to improve what we call voting.

And the message we want them to listen to is that we want laws to change from forcing us, as employees and customers, to work for cheap and buy at inflated prices.

We are happy when people build valuable businesses and earn lots of money from that business. But we are unhappy when people overcharge and underpay and exploit our currently primitive elections to protect laws that force the opposite, low pay and high prices.

We want to build a huge, worldwide community based on cooperation instead of fighting.

Adopting better vote-counting methods will get us there.

I'm not growing tired of playing the role of peacekeeper. But I am getting tired of waiting for better cooperation, less fighting, so I can get a window seat.

I now get a window seat every time I drive. And I get to see the road ahead. And what I see is that future generations will enjoy widespread economic prosperity, much less warfare, a huge middle class, less economic suffering, fewer lawyers, and incredibly beautiful music.

We have computers that can do the tedious parts of pairwise vote counting for us.

Extra paragraphs:

Currently civilization is still quite primitive. I've glimpsed some future innovations that will take us from current states of homelessness, widespread poverty, mass shootings, foolish wars, and annoying ads.

Politics is very unlike dancing. There is lots of conflict in the world of politics. And there is lots of corruption. 

Here's one future innovation. It's a way to reduce crime. Currently young people learn about crime from movies, TV shows, computer games, and [...] YouTube videos. I suggest that we add another rating to movies and computer games. The added movie and game rating would indicate how many years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown on the screen.

Now that you know I'm naive, I can share an even bigger innovation that will spread peace worldwide.

Employees must accept low wages to get affordable health insurance.

If politicians stop protecting these corrupt laws, wealthy business owners will stop funding their election campaigns.
