Prosperity Tipping Point

When I was a kid I always sat between my sister and brother in the back seat of our family's station wagon. I was the youngest, with the shortest legs, and in that era all cars had a bump in the floor, so that bump was my footrest.

One day, at the beginning of a long road trip, it dawned on me that my legs had reached the floor. I didn't like straddling that bump, and I longed for a window seat. I wanted to look out a window without someone's head blocking my view. So I asked my mom for a window seat.

She sighed and said "OK, let's give it a try." I switched places with my brother because my sister got car sick. At long last my patience was rewarded. My feet had room to move. I happily stared out the right side window with nobody's head obstructing my view.

The experience was glorious. But it lasted for just a few minutes. By then my sister and brother were fighting. My mom told them to stop, and then said to me "Do you mind moving back to the middle?" I said "I don't mind now that I know WHY I'm in the middle."

That was the day it dawned on me that I was a peacekeeper. In that case between my sister and brother.

Since then I've been a peacekeeper between housemates, between friends, among neighbors, online, and more.

Now I'm stepping forward to help serve as a peacekeeper for the biggest conflicts around the world.

Yet peace isn't the goal I seek. Peace is just the absense of conflict. I want the OPPOSITE of conflict.

One word for the opposite of conflict is cooperation. Yet even that word doesn't reveal what I really want.

For lack of a better word, I want people to build a sense of community.

I've experienced and enjoyed a sense of community in a variety of situations. In two university towns, in households where we've gone beyond just cooperating and have become friends, among neighbors who don't all like one another, and especially among non-competitive social dancers.

Social dancers cooperate because we deeply understand that we can reach higher levels of spiritual experience.

I admit that dancing is a foolish thing to do. It's illogical. We move a lot, yet we get nowhere. At least not physically.

But in spirit, we fly! Our spirits soar!

I don't just seek that goal for myself. Another source of joy comes from putting a smile on the face of the woman I'm dancing with.

What happens in dancing is a huge contrast to the so-call real world. The world of work. And earning money. And competing for jobs. And businesses competing against similar businesses. And political parties competing for votes. In that so-called real life, alas, under current conditions, many people prefer to compete rather than cooperate.

The island of Haiti demonstrates what happens when there is no cooperation, no trust, and not even a willingness to volunteer to work on even obviously worthy projects. The people who live there struggle to survive. And it's not just a coincidence that the Haitian government is very corrupt.

Here in the United States we cooperate more than many people realize. Consider that within a business the employees who believe in conflicting religions put aside their conflicts while at work. And both Republicans and Democrats work together.

Very significantly, it's that cooperation WITHIN a business that brings economic prosperity to that business. In contrast, a business that lacks cooperation among its employees earns less money. Or an otherwise normal business that offers what customers want can fail. As Abraham Lincoln said, "A house divided cannot stand."

Notice that competing against similar businesses is what MOTIVATES employees to cooperate. Money is the reward for cooperating within the business and competing against external businesses.

Successful cooperation is rewarded with money. Employees earn higher salaries. Executives earn large bonuses. And business owners can sell the company's stock at a higher price.

What happens when we extend this idea of cooperation to large numbers of citizens who live under the control of same government?

Let's consider the economic prosperity that happened during the 1950s and 1960s in the United States.

Back then, practically everyone who wanted a good-paying job could work in a factory or sell products and earn enough to buy an automobiles and maybe buy a house. And income taxes gave the government plenty of money to build lots of roads and bridges and big buildings.

That was when our family was taking road trips in our station wagon. Back then I rarely saw homeless people. I seldom heard about drug abuse. And Wikipedia reveals that there were only a couple of school shootings during those two decades.

What caused that prosperity? Some people believe the prosperity was caused by democracy, or capitalism, or whatever. But actually it arose from luck.

During the first half of the 1900's most of the nations that had factories got their factories destroyed by bombs dropped from enemy aircraft. But here in the contiguous 48 States only one enemy bomb was dropped, and it didn't explode. The factories in Canada and most of Russia also were not attacked. As a result, when the fighting ended in 1945, nearly everyone living in Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East had to buy manufactured products from the U.S., Canada, and Russia.

In other words, the widespread economic prosperity that we experienced in the United States during the 50s and 60s was caused by having a temporary monopoly on working factories. That is why people in other nations sent us shiploads of money, plus valuable items we accepted in exchange for our manufactured products.

That monopoly ended around 1970 when new factories in those bombed nations transitioned from making essential products needed for rebuilding, to making non-essential products like plastic toys, transistor radios, and the eight-track tape player for cars.

But avoiding fights and hoping that bullies will leave us alone is not a strategy for greatness. It's much better to improve technologies in transportation, communication, and financial transactions. These are the kinds of innovations that bring widespread economic prosperity.

Improving financial transactions was an important part of the prosperity that produced the Italian Renaissance. Recall that the Renaissance in Italy happened because wealthy business owners, including the Medici family, had surplus money to pay Leonardo da Vinci to paint masterpieces, the best known of which are his Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. And wealthy patrons paid Michaelangelo to sculpt the statue of David and amazing statues for their tombs. Also that was when the violin was invented and became part of symphonic music.

The wealth to pay for non-essential things like paintings, statues, and music arose because of innovations in banking, which led to bigger and more trustworthy banks.

Before big banks came along, highway robbery was a popular profession. This meant that traders had to hire armed guards to protect the gold and silver and precious gems they carried to pay for whatever they were buying. The danger of trading between cities limited the economic prosperity of cities.

It's easy for us to forget that we no longer have to worry about highway robbery because trustworthy banks allow us to write paper documents that transfer money in ways that highway robbers cannot exploit.

How did banks grow beyond just single bankers and small family banks?

An important innovation was to hire one group of accountants to keep track of debits and hire a different group of accountants to keep track of credits. This method doubled the work of doing calculations, yet it had a big advantage. This approach made it easy to detect the moment an employee tried to embezzle money.

With bigger banks it became possible to finance bigger trade deals. Notably that included loaning money to pay the expenses of sending big sailing ships to bypass the trade monopoly that Muslims had on land transportation along the Silk Road to China. And bigger banks made it possible for wealthy churches to build impressive cathedrals.

Yet beneath these banking innovations, there was an even more important innovation.

Up until the middle ages people had done counting with counting marks. In Italy the convention was that three marks indicated the number three, the letter V indicated the number five, the letter X indicated ten, and the letter C indicated one hundred. You recognize this writing method as Roman numerals.

Imagine trying to divide two numbers using Roman numerals. If bank accountants had to do that kind of math, they wouldn't just rebel against doing the same calculations twice, once for debits and a second time for credits. Accountants would wait in long lines to jump off bridges.

That's why money lenders back then avoided doing division. Instead they used fractions. A fraction is just a way to indicate that one number needs to be divided by another number. Ancient Italians didn't have a way to convert fractions into a single number. They used some clever tricks for adding and subtracting fractions, but multiplying was a nightmare, and division was literally unthinkable.

The Chinese used a better counting method. They put their counting marks inside of a square. That way an empty square represented the number zero.

The people in India partially copied that way of writing numbers. But they did not copy the Chinese practice of using the abacus to do calculations. Instead, some genius in India developed a way to do multiplication and division using a process that involved writing numbers. That was when the digits zero through nine were invented. And that's multiplication tables were invented.

Doing calculations with the digits zero through nine was the big innovation that propelled the world's economy to the prosperity we enjoy today.

Europeans named those digits Arabic numerals. That's because Europeans learned them from Muslims, who learn the Arabic language because Mohammed wrote the Qu'aran[?] in Arabic.

By the way, using the same language was an important part of controlling trade along segments of the Silk Road to China, so it's another example of cooperation leading to economic prosperity.

If you're thinking that this bit of history about the digits zero through nine is essoteric, then you probably struggled when you studied physics. That's because the biggest challenge in physics is understanding division. Not how to do the calculation. Schools teach that. But what does division really mean?

People who don't understand the concept of division hate physics. Ironically schools even promote this confusion by failing to mention that division is disguised under special names such as ratio, proportion, rate, percent, and the word per.

Yet division is incredibly important, especially in engineering and physics. It's at the foundation of sending people to the moon, and bringing them back, building big bridges, building ever-better automobiles, building computers and the internet, developing vaccines, calculating interest rates, and countless other miracles of our so-called "modern" age.

It was a thousand years ago that these digits entered Europe. They were being taught in an Islamic university in North Africa just across from Spain. A student named Gerbert of Aurillac learned how to calculate using these digits. Then in the year 999 he became the Pope in Rome, where he became known as Pope Sylvestor the Second.

Pope Sylvestor could do multiplication and division much faster than other Romans because he used Arabic numbers. They were still using Roman numerals.

You might expect that the digits zero through nine would have been welcomed as an obvious improvement. Instead some Medieval Christian Churchs elsewhere in Italy declared the use of Arabic numerals to be a sin.

Imagine asking a Roman of that time why they objected to using Arabic numerals.

They would say they already had words for counting from zero to ten.

They would say that learning how to use multiplication tables was too complex, or time-consuming.

And they would dismiss them because they were used by their enemy, Arabic speaking people in Africa and the Middle East.

It took two centuries -- that's 200 years -- until the first European book about them was published. It was written by another Leonardo, this one from Pisa. Today he is known by the name Fibonacci.

We laugh at the foolishness of Romans who dismissed the digits zero through nine.

Yet right now we are in a similar situation. And we are saying the same kinds of things about another innovation. Future generations will be laughing at our foolishness. Especially because it was known back in xxx. And books that use it have been published since .... [Condorcet].

This simple innovation is another kind of counting.

It's called "pairwise vote counting."

We dismiss pairwise vote counting with the same kinds of responses that ancient Romans used to dismiss Arabic numerals.

Many people today say things like "This new-fangled idea sounds essoteric."

And "We get along fine with the counting methods we already have."

Maybe you're thinking the word "pairwise" involves something that's difficult to learn. Yet we already do pairwise contests in the world of team sports. Each team can only play against one other team, one pair of teams at a time. That's what the word pairwise means.

Maybe you're thinking that the word "vote" in pairwise vote counting is too political. And we already have enough conflict in politics.

As a geek with a degree in physics I'd love to explain how pairwise vote counting works. But that's not what I'm here to do. Anyway, computers can do pairwise counting faster than we humans can.

What I want to explain is how pairwise vote counting will lead to higher levels of democracy. And how that will be followed by higher levels of economic prosperity.

Imagine the economy as a cherry pie. If someone cuts a big piece of that pie there is less pie avaiable for everyone else. Yet this is what many large corporations are doing. They are using money to control politicians to write laws that create virtual monopolies and legal ways to force employees and consumers to earn less money and pay higher prices.

If just a couple of businesses give themselves a large slice of economic pie, that still leaves plenty of economic pie for the rest of us. But when lots and lots of businesses give themselves large slices of economic pie, the rest of us suffer, at least economically.

For example, if pharmacutical companies overcharge for medications, and health insurance companies overcharge for health insurance, and cable companies overcharge for entertainment, and governments impose high taxes and fees, then the combined effect is dramatically less economic pie for those of us who are employees and consumers.

And that drains prosperity from our economy. Especially if we could instead be spending our money to pay musicians for music, pay for more take-out food cooked for us, and ....

We tend to think we are so advanced because we use voting to allow citizens to control government actions. Yet clearly money has more influence than votes.

It happens because we use election counting methods that are as primitive as Roman numerals.

On an election ballot we are allowed to mark just one candidate for each political position. That preference information is so limited that there is only one way to count that kind of ballot. It's called "plurality" counting. Or in some English speaking nations it's called "first past the post" counting.

Instead we as voters should be allowed to mark a ballot to indicate our first choice, our second choice, third choice, and so on.

That preference information can be counted using pairwise vote counting. Computers can do the counting.

What's important for voters to understand is that pairwise vote counting looks deeply into those ranked choice ballots to identify which candidate is really most popular.

How will this lead to economic prosperity?

I wish I could share with you the solutions to big problems that are waiting to be adopted when politicians are controlled by votes instead of money. Alas, those solutions don't have names.

When I've tried to name the future innovations, I've failed to convey what I see. For example, when I was a teenager and my brother and father asked me why I didn't want a camera, I said I was waiting for the electronic kind of camera. They had no clue what I was talking about. If I had known that they would become known as digital cameras, using that name wouldn't have helped them understand.

Just as Europeans centuries ago were slow to realize that adopting the digits zero through nine would lead to huge increases in economic prosperity, we, those of us living now, are slow to realize that adopting pairwise vote counting will lead to huge increases in economic prosperity.


We can fly. We can create wonderous communities. We can lead lives that are less like fighting and more like dancing.

We want to build a huge, worldwide community based on cooperation instead of fighting.

Adopting pairwise vote counting for our elections will take us to that dramatically prosperous future.


Extra paragraphs:

Part of the reason you haven't heard about it is that most new knowledge about math comes from academic professors who do research that's funded by their government. But what government is going to fund research about better ways to vote?

This lack of funding to study better vote-counting methods results in very few articles in academic journals. In turn, Wikipedia does not have up-to-date information about this subject because Wikipedia editors reject math information that isn't backed up by academic journal articles.

What evidence supports the idea that elections are unfair? Most voters are frustrated by all the candidates listed on our ballot.

Through written articles, opinions voiced at political events, and sometimes in protests we express our dissatisfaction with both the Republican and Democratic parties.

This conflict between voters and the biggest campaign contributors is what I'm stepping forward to solve.

I'm not growing tired of playing the role of peacekeeper. But I am getting tired of waiting for better cooperation, and less fighting. I want a window seat.

Our current vote-counting methods are easily exploited in ways that involve money.

I want you to imagine a future in which bright young people are attracted to become technology designers instead of being attracted by money to become lawyers. We can do that by changing laws that currently tax law firms the same as software firms. And we can make lots of other changes for the better because current attitudes about conflict cause bankers to be more rewarded than public school teachers.

I want you to imagine our nation as a cooperative community, where fairer voting leads to fairer laws, and fairer laws lead to widespread economic prosperity, and widespread economic prosperity leads to another Renaissance in art, music, dance, movies with lower years-in-prison ratings, and spirited [...].

I've been blessed to get a window seat where I can see the future. We don't need to let immature impulses guide our behavior.

We are happy when people build valuable businesses and earn lots of money from that business. But we are unhappy when people overcharge and underpay and exploit our currently primitive elections to protect laws that force the opposite, low pay and high prices.

I now get a window seat every time I drive. And I get to see the road ahead. And what I see is that future generations will enjoy widespread economic prosperity, much less warfare, a huge middle class, less economic suffering, fewer lawyers, and incredibly beautiful music.

Our current voting methods in use around the world, including in Europe and Australia and New Zealand, are primitive. All of us, in at least some elections, when we vote, we can only mark a single choice from among a list of choices.

Just two or three decades ago when computers arrived we could have adopted a counting method that would increase the world's economic prosperity as dramatically as Arabic numerals increased Europe's economic prosperity.

And consider that along with more trade and commerce, less fighting results in less money being spent on healing injuries and repairing damage.

Trust is a key part of cooperating. Today we benefit from trust among strangers on the roads between cities. They are less likely to be highway robbers. Lengths of fabric and bulk foods in bags are more likely to be measured fairly. The goods sold by weight, what we now call "per pound," are more likely to be priced at the advertised price per weight.

Currently civilization is still quite primitive. I've glimpsed some future innovations that will take us from current states of homelessness, widespread poverty, mass shootings, foolish wars, and annoying ads.

Here's one future innovation. It's a way to reduce crime. Currently young people learn about crime from movies, TV shows, computer games, and [...] YouTube videos. I suggest that we add another rating to movies and computer games. The added movie and game rating would indicate how many years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown on the screen.

Employees must accept low wages to get affordable health insurance.

If politicians stop protecting these corrupt laws, wealthy business owners will stop funding their election campaigns.
