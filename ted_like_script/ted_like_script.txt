When I was a kid I always sat between my sister and brother in the back seat of our family's station wagon. Back in those days the floor had a bump to make room for the shaft that connected the rear wheels to the engine in the front. That was my footrest for my short legs. Until one day it dawned on me that my legs had reached the floor and it was a hassle to straddle that bump. And I longed for a window seat.

So I asked my mother if I could sit by the window. She sighed and said "OK, let's give it a try." My sister got car sick so I switched places with my brother. At long last my patience was rewarded. My feet had room to move around, and I stared out the unobstructed window for a few glorious minutes.

Yup, within minutes my sister and brother had started fighting. My mother said "Do you mind moving back to the middle?" I said "I don't mind now that I know WHY I'm in the middle." It was then that I realized I was a peacekeeper between my sister and brother.

Since then, as an adult, I have often played the role of peacekeeper. Between housemates. Among friends. Among neighbors. As the de-facto leader of a dance performance group. And now I'm stepping forward to serve as a peacekeeper for conflicts around the world.

It would be trite to say that the key to resolving conflicts is better communication. Duh!

Yet there are many kinds of communication. It's not done just with words.

And it would be trite to say that the key to doing what's never been done before is to think creatively.

Yet civilization is still quite primitive. I've glimpsed some future innovations that will take us from current states of homelessness, widespread poverty, mass shootings, foolish wars, and annoying ads.

I now get a window seat every time I drive. And I get to see the road ahead. And what I see is a future in future generations will enjoy widespread economic prosperity, much less warfare, a huge middle class, less economic suffering, fewer lawyers, and incredibly beautiful music.

Here's one future innovation. It's a way to reduce crime. Currently young people learn about crime from movies, TV shows, computer games, and [...] YouTube videos. I suggest that we add another rating to movies and computer games. The added movie and game rating would indicate how many years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown on the screen.

Now that you know I'm naive, I can share an even bigger innovation that will spread peace worldwide.

Yet peace isn't the goal I seek. Peace is just the absense of conflict. I want the OPPOSITE of conflict.

The opposite of conflict is cooperation. Yet that word doesn't reveal what I really want.

For lack of a better word, I want people to build a sense of community.

I've been blessed to be a part of groups of people who get along because we deeply understand that we can reach higher levels of spiritual experience.

Lots of those experiences have been among dancers.

Dancing is a foolish thing to do. It's illogical. We move a lot yet, get we get nowhere. At least not physically. But in spirit, we fly. And it's a kind of flying that's even better than flying physically. As a bonus, it saves a lot of gas.

So let's look back in history to times when spirits soared.

When I was young I was very fortunate to grow up during a time of great economic prosperity, the 1950s and 1960s. Compared to now, few people were homeless. Practically everyone who wanted a job working in a factory got one. Automobiles were affordable. Buying a house was affordable for the middle class. And even then I knew that gasoline was ridiculously cheap.

What caused this prosperity? Some people would say it's about democracy, or capitalism, or whatever. Yet actually it was just luck.

It was preceded by world wars one and two. The industrialized nations, that is the ones that had factories, were fighting each other and bombing each other's factories. In Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. But the factories in the United States and Canada were not bombed. So when the wars ended the entire world had to buy manufactured products from the United States and Canada. That's the real reason I was growing up at a place, and in a time, when there was widespread economic prosperity.

We already know that conflict causes suffering. That suffering included economic hardships. And economic good times if a nation could somehow avoid getting bombed.

Yet we're looking for the opposite of conflict. Not just the absence of conflict, but it's opposite. So let's look farther back into history.

A time of great prosperity was what we call the Italian Renaissance. It's obvious from the name that it was happening in Italy. That was back when Leonardo da Vinci painted the Mona Lisa. And Michaelangelo sculpted the statue of David. And the violin was invented.

But those times of great culture arose out of a time of great prosperity. Just before the Italian Renaissance, Italy and Europe were experiencing a huge surge in economic prosperity. That's why money was available to pay for non-essential things like paintings, statues, and music.

What gets overlooked is that that prosperity arose because of innovations in banking.

And a big part of those banking innovations was something we tend to forget. Or underestimate. It was an innovation that began centuries earlier.

Long before Rome rose to wealth, and then power, the world wrote numbers using counting marks. The version used in Rome was called Roman numerals. Those are the primitive counting marks where the letter V means 5, X means 10, and C means one hundred.

Imagine trying to divide two numbers using Roman numerals. If modern-day banks calculated percent interest that way we would have long lines of accountants waiting in line to jump off bridges.

A key turning point for Europe was when a man named [?] was a student in a university created by a wealthy Muslim widow. He learned to use the digits zero through nine.

That innovation started in India. Probably because they saw that the Chinese wrote numbers using counting marks inside a square. That means that when there was no mark in the square, there was still a square. It served as a placeholder. The Chinese used the abacus for their calculations so they didn't need to invent the digits zero through nine.

Another leap forward happened when a wise Muslim leader, ..., spent money gathering books and wise scholars from around the known world and paying them to develop even more innovations. That was centered in the middle East, in the area of what we now know as Bagdad. That was one of those communities. Where spirits soared because people could spend less time, and less money, protecting themselves from crimes that were commonplace in other times and places.

The spread of Islam was fueled by fighting and conquering. Yet as a byproduct that spread the Arabic language in which Mohammed had written the Koran.

That's what spread the digits zero through nine to north Africa. And the desire of a wealthy Arabic woman to use her fortune to not just build a mosque, but to build what became one of the world's first universities.

A university is another wonderous community. I still have fond experiences of living in that world. I fact I lingered living in university towns because of that sense of community. A university throws together strangers from far and wide. Yet the conflicts are subdued because students who fight physically, or rape, or steal are expelled.

Those turning points in the middle east and north Africa made a difference because the student I mentioned returned to Rome and later became Pope [...]. He could do multiplication and division much faster than the other Romans, who were still using Roman numerals. This story of communication about those digits is why Europeans called them Arabic numerals.

It took another century [?] before Leonardo da Pisa published the first European book about how to use the digits zero through nine. Do you remember that I said that innovations in communication are important? The innovation of printing using moveable type was what made it possible for lots of people to learn how to do calculations using those digits. With that training financiers could hire accountants. And those businesses grew into banks. That was the family business of the Medici family in Florence. They were the wealthy people who employed Leonardo da Vinci.

What's the big deal about banking? Highway robbers were put out of business. That's because traders didn't need to carry gold and silver. Instead they carried what amounts to identification papers that were worthless to anyone who stole them.

Notice that banking is yet another form of communication. And it led to more trade and commerce. And less fighting. Which led to less money wasted on repairing damage caused by fighting. And less money wasted on healthcare for healing injuries caused by physical fighting.

Before this banking revolution in Italy there was another source of great wealth. The people in the Middle East were prosperous because they controlled trade along the silk road to China. Gold and silver flowed to China in return for silk and porcelain.

Now you recognize that a simple innovation in counting was at the foundation of great economic prosperity in Europe. In turn it provided funding for the ships and adventurers who explored ways to bypass the Silk Road and directly trade with China.

Notice that a simple innovation in counting, namely the digits zero through nine and the process of using them, led to huge increases in economic prosperity for the trading centers of Europe.

There is yet another simple innovation in counting that will lead to huge increases in economic prosperity to whichever regions adopt that counting innovation.

Here in the United States we tend to think that we are so advanced because we use voting to allow citizens to control government actions.

Yet we know that Washington DC is full of conflict and corruption. Not in the form of physical fighting. Or outright stealing. But because wealthy business owners are able to use money,  in the form of campaign contributions, to control election results. And politicians, the ones who win elections, know they must protect the laws that unfairly force employees and customers to pay inflated prices to the businesses owned by those biggest campaign contributors. If they don't, wealthy business owners will stop funding their election campaigns.

[need better transition here]

A simple innovation called pairwise vote counting is waiting for us to adopt. That simple counting method will transform elections into the form of communication that they were intended to be.

Remember that voting is supposed to be how voters communicate their desires to leaders.

Alas, we use election counting methods that are as primitive as Roman numerals.

And just as Europeans centuries ago were slow to realize that adopting the digits zero through nine would lead to huge increases in economic prosperity, we, those of us living now, are slow to realize that adopting pairwise vote counting will lead to huge increases in economic prosperity.

What's the link between a better vote-counting method and increased economic prosperity?

Imagine changing corrupt laws that currently allow large corporations to take more money from your wallet than you would have to pay if we had fairer laws.

Imagine ....

I'm a geek, so I'd love to show you how pairwise vote counting works. Yet when I try to explain it, the typical reaction is that it's essoteric.

Yet the digits zero through nine were essoteric to Europeans who did calculations using Roman numerals. It's only in hindsight that the importance becomes clear.

So instead I'm choosing to focus on my role as a peacekeeper.

I want you to understand that way too much time and money and resources are wasted when we don't communicate clearly.

I want you to imagine a future in which bright young people are attracted to become technology designers instead of being attracted by money to become lawyers. We can do that by changing laws that currently tax law firms the same as software firms. And we can make lots of other changes for the better because current attitudes about conflict cause bankers to be more rewarded than public school teachers.

I want you to imagine our nation as a cooperative community, where fairer voting leads to fairer laws, and fairer laws lead to widespread economic prosperity, and widespread economic prosperity leads to another Renaissance in art, music, dance, movies with lower years-in-prison ratings, and spirited [...].

I've been blessed to get a window seat where I can see the future. We don't need to let immature impulses guide our behavior.

We can fly. We can create wonderous communities. We can lead lives that are less like fighting and more like dancing.

What stops us is a failure to appreciate that innovations in counting provides the bridge that will take us to that prosperous future.

In the meantime we count votes so crudely that money tactics easily exploit this form of communication in ways that cause politicians to believe they need to do what their biggest campaign contributors want. 

That future is waiting for any region or nation that spreads the innovation of pairwise vote counting as a better way to improve what we call voting.

Voting is primitive. Let's change it so that politicians hear us voters loudly and clearly.
