"TED" talk script for video
---------------------------

When I was a kid I always sat between my sister and brother in the back seat of our family's station wagon. Back in those days the car's floor had a bump to make room for the shaft that connected the rear wheels to the engine in the front. That bump was my footrest for my short legs.

One day, at the beginning of a long road trip, it dawned on me that my legs had reached the floor. It was a hassle to straddle that bump. And I longed for a window seat. I was tired of seeing heads between me and the view out the windows. So I asked my mom for a window seat.

She sighed and said "OK, let's give it a try." My sister got car sick, so I switched places with my brother. At long last my patience was rewarded. My feet had room to move around. And I happily stared out the window with nobody's head obstructing my view.

That lasted for a few glorious ... minutes. That's all it took for my sister and brother to start fighting. So my mom said "Do you mind moving back to the middle?" I said "I don't mind now that I know WHY I'm in the middle."

That was the day it dawned on me that I was a peacekeeper between my sister and brother. What I learned being a peacekeeper has been very useful.

Since then I've played the role of peacekeeper between college housemates, among friends, among neighbors, online, and more.

Now I'm stepping forward to serve as a peacekeeper for conflicts around the world.

Yet peace isn't the goal I seek. Peace is just the absense of conflict. I want the OPPOSITE of conflict.

The opposite of conflict is cooperation. Yet even the word cooperation doesn't reveal what I really want.

For lack of a better word, I want people to build a sense of community.

One kind of community I've experienced and enjoyed is the feeling of a university town where troublemakers and fighters are easily expelled or locked up because they so strongly contrast with academic-minded folks.

Even better has been a sense of community among a small group of people. Sometimes it's happened in a household where we go beyond just cooperating for selfish reasons. Sometimes I've experienced a sense of community among friends. Sometimes even among neighbors. Yet my fondest recollections come from the sense of community that arises among non-competitive social dancers.

Social dancers cooperate because we deeply understand that we can reach higher levels of spiritual experience.

I admit that dancing is a foolish thing to do. It's illogical. We move a lot, yet we get nowhere. At least not physically.

But in spirit, we fly! That's a most wonderful experience. Flying in spirit.

Yet I don't just seek the goal of flying in spirit for myself. Part of my joy comes from putting a smile on the face of the woman I'm dancing with. That's the best reward for dancing in ways that make the spirit soar.

Dancing is a big contrast with the regular world. The world of work. And earning money. And competing for jobs. And businesses competing with similar businesses. And political parties competing for votes. In those parts of life, alas, under current conditions, many people believe that competing yields more profit than cooperating.

Yet consider that within a business there are dramatic levels of cooperation. Employees who work for the same business yet who believe in conflicting religions put aside those conflicts while at work. And the most profitable businesses hire both Republicans and Democrats and fire employees who are unable to work with people who have conflicting political views. It's that cooperation within the business that brings economic prosperity to the business.

That cooperation is rewarded with money, in the form of higher wages.

In turn, higher wages reduce suffering, and anger, and reduce the urge to conflict in other areas of life.

I grew up during a time of great economic prosperity, the 1950s and 1960s. Compared to now, few people were homeless, drug use was far less common than now, and school shootings were extremely rare. Practically everyone who wanted a good-paying job working in a factory or selling products had a good-paying job. Back then, automobiles were affordable, buying a house was affordable for the middle class, and even then it was clear that gasoline was ridiculously cheap. And there was money to build roads and bridges and big buildings, which sadly are now among the ones that are long overdue for repairs.

The cause of that prosperity is easy to misunderstand. Some people claim the prosperity was caused by democracy, or capitalism, or whatever. But actually it arose from luck.

During the first half of the 1900's most of the nations that had factories got their factories destroyed by bombs dropped from enemy aircraft. Yet except for the attack on Hawaii, only one bomb was dropped on the United States, and it didn't explode. Canada and most of Russia were also spared from getting their factories bombed. So when the fighting ended, people througout Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Middle East had to buy manufactured products from the United States and Canada and Russia.

That is what created the widespread economic prosperity of the United States during the 50s and 60s. People throughout the world were sending us money and valuable items to pay for US-manufactured products.

But relying on luck is not a wise strategy for achieving economic prosperity.

A much better strategy is to do what leads to big gains in economic prosperity for most people in a region.

A good example of that better strategy is what happened in history just before the Italian Renaissance. That was a time of widespread economic prosperity for Italy. That was when wealthy business owners, most notably the Medici family, paid Leonardo da Vinci to paint masterpieces, the best known of which are the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. And those wealthy patrons paid Michaelangelo to sculpt the statue of David and statues for their tombs. And that was when the violin was invented.

Why was there so much prosperity that money was available to pay for non-essential things like paintings, statues, and music?

Much of that wealth arose because of innovations in banking. Why did banking matter?

Before big banks came along, trade between cities required carrying  gold and silver and precious gems to pay for whatever they were buying. To protect themselves, those traders had to hire armed guards when they travelled. When banks became big enough and trustworthy enough, only paper documents needed to be carried to record the transfers of wealth.

What enabled banks to become bigger than just a single banker or a banking family?

One innovation was double-entry bookkeeping. This method makes it very difficult for employees to embezzle money. That's because the accountants who keep track of debits are different from the accountants who keep track of credits. An embezzler working alone will cause the debits and credits to not match, and that triggers an audit to uncover the embezzler.

With bigger banks, it became practical to finance bigger trade deals, bigger construction projects, and of course the big sailing ships that searched for a way to bypass the trade monopoly along the Silk Road to China.

Yet beneath this innovation was an even more important innovation.

Ealier in history people had done counting with counting marks. For example, three marks indicated the number three. And when you got to five marks you can summarize that with the letter V. And X means ten. And the letter C means one hundred. You remember learning those as the Roman numerals. That's what Italy was using during the Middle Ages.

The Chinese used a better method. They put their counting marks inside of a square. That way an empty square represented the number zero. Everywhere already had words such as "none," and "nobody," and "zero." But this innovation allowed a big number to have something that today we would reconize as the digit zero.

That innovation alone was not the big deal.

In nearby India they didn't use the abacus for calculations like the Chinese did, so some genius in India invented a way to multiply and divide using an early version of what we now recognize as the digits zero through nine.

To appreciate it's importance, imagine trying to divide two numbers using Roman numerals. If accountants had to do that kind of math, there would be long lines of accountants waiting in line to jump off bridges.

Being able to do division on paper was a huge innovation. If you remember suffering when you learned how to add and subtract fractions, you know what I mean. A fraction is just a division calculation that hasn't yet been done. During the days of Roman numerals they avoided doing division by using fractions.

Perhaps you are wondering what's so important about division. If so, you probably struggled when you learned physics. That's because the biggest challenge in physics is understanding division. Not how to do the calculation. Schools teach that. But what does division really mean?

The people who don't understand the concept of division hate physics. Ironically schools increase confusion by failing to mention that division is disguised under special names such as ratio, proportion, rate, percent, and the word per.

The technology we rely on today heavily depends on both understanding division and knowing how to do it. In other words, division is at the foundation of sending people to the moon, and bringing them back, building big bridges, building ever-better automobiles, developing vaccines, and countless other miracles of our so-called "modern" age.

Yet when the digits zero through nine arrived in Rome they were not just unappreciated. The Medieval Christian Church declared using them a sin. And using those digits was declared illegal.

Even today there are people who say we should not teach "Arabic numerals" in public schools. Yet that's the name for the digits zero through nine.

Ironically back in Medieval times probably lots of Europeans failed to realize that they were benefiting from the use of Arabic numerals. That's because the Muslims who controlled European access to trade with China used those digits, plus learning the shared language of Arabic, which is the language of the [Qu'aran?] written by Mohammed.

It's ironic because lots of Europeans earned lots of money selling products that the Chinese wanted. And they spent lots of money buying luxury items from China. And that trade with China along the Silk Road was partly possible because of double-entry bookkeeping. And because of weighing what was bought and sold, without using fractions.

A key turning point for Europe happened in North Africa, just across from Spain, where a wealthy Muslim widow had funded an Islamic university alongside the Islamic house of worship that she also funded. One of the students there was a man named [?]. He learned to use the digits zero through nine. In the year 999 he became the Pope in Rome.

At that time Romans were still using Roman numerals. So he could do multiplication and division much faster.

You might expect that the advantages of using the digits zero through nine was rather obvious. And that they would be adopted quickly. Nope.

It took another two centuries -- that's 200 years -- before Leonardo of Pisa, who is known to us as Fibonacci, published the first European book that explained how to use the digits zero through nine. Another popular book on the topic was written by a friend of Leaonardo da Vinci.

Bigger banking led to more trade and commerce, which are forms of cooperation. There was still some fighting going on. But there was less fighting. Less highway robbery. Less burglary. Less assault. That lead to less money wasted on repairing damage and healthcare.

And especially important were higher levels of trust. Trust of travelling, trust of trade deals being fair, and ....

Why have I spent time explaining that a simple innovation in counting, namely the digits zero through nine and the process of using them, led to huge increases in economic prosperity throughout Europe?

Because a similar pattern is going on now. A highly valuable innovation is waiting to be appreciated. Yet currently it gets little attention.

The innovation is called "pairwise vote counting."

At this point you may be thinking "That sounds essoteric." That's the same kind of reaction that probably greeted people who promoted the idea of using Arabic numerals.

Or maybe you're thinking "We already know how to count." That would be like a Medieval Roman saying "We don't need the digit zero because we already have words for zero."

Or maybe you're thinking "Pairwise, that sounds obscure, or unuseful, or even complex." That would be like ancient Romans saying "What's wrong with Roman numerals? They work fine for addition and subtraction. And we get along fine with using fractions instead of division."

The digits zero through nine were essoteric to Europeans who did calculations using Roman numerals. It's only in hindsight that the importance becomes clear.

In a similar way, hindsight will clearly reveal the powerful changes that await civilization when we adopt pairwise vote counting.

So I'm going to try to give you that hindsight, in advance.

Do you remember learning that voting is supposed to be how voters communicate their desires to leaders? 

Alas, we use election counting methods that are as primitive as Roman numerals.


 is waiting for us to adopt. That simple counting method will transform elections into the form of communication that they were intended to be.


Voting is now primitive. Let's change it. Let's make sure that politicians hear us voters loudly and clearly.

And just as Europeans centuries ago were slow to realize that adopting the digits zero through nine would lead to huge increases in economic prosperity, we, those of us living now, are slow to realize that adopting pairwise vote counting will lead to huge increases in economic prosperity.

What's the link between a better vote-counting method and increased economic prosperity?

Imagine changing corrupt laws that currently allow large corporations to take more money from your wallet than you would have to pay if we had fairer laws.


I want you to imagine a future in which bright young people are attracted to become technology designers instead of being attracted by money to become lawyers. We can do that by changing laws that currently tax law firms the same as software firms. And we can make lots of other changes for the better because current attitudes about conflict cause bankers to be more rewarded than public school teachers.

I want you to imagine our nation as a cooperative community, where fairer voting leads to fairer laws, and fairer laws lead to widespread economic prosperity, and widespread economic prosperity leads to another Renaissance in art, music, dance, movies with lower years-in-prison ratings, and spirited [...].

I've been blessed to get a window seat where I can see the future. We don't need to let immature impulses guide our behavior.

We can fly. We can create wonderous communities. We can lead lives that are less like fighting and more like dancing.

What stops us is a failure to appreciate that pairwise vote counting is already beginning to provide a bridge that will take us to that prosperous future.

That future is waiting for any region or nation that spreads the innovation of pairwise vote counting as a better way to improve what we call voting.


And the message we want them to listen to is that we want laws to change from forcing us, as employees and customers, to work for cheap and buy at inflated prices.

We are happy when people build valuable businesses and earn lots of money from that business. But we are unhappy when people overcharge and underpay and exploit our currently primitive elections to protect laws that force the opposite, low pay and high prices.

We want to build a huge, worldwide community based on cooperation instead of fighting.

Adopting better vote-counting methods will get us there.

I'm not growing tired of playing the role of peacekeeper. But I am getting tired of waiting for better cooperation, less fighting, so I can get a window seat.

I now get a window seat every time I drive. And I get to see the road ahead. And what I see is that future generations will enjoy widespread economic prosperity, much less warfare, a huge middle class, less economic suffering, fewer lawyers, and incredibly beautiful music.

Extra paragraphs:

Currently civilization is still quite primitive. I've glimpsed some future innovations that will take us from current states of homelessness, widespread poverty, mass shootings, foolish wars, and annoying ads.

Politics is very unlike dancing. There is lots of conflict in the world of politics. And there is lots of corruption. 

We tend to think we are so advanced because we use voting to allow citizens to control government actions. Yet clearly money has more influence than votes.

This conflict between voters and the biggest campaign contributors is what I'm stepping forward to solve.

Here's one future innovation. It's a way to reduce crime. Currently young people learn about crime from movies, TV shows, computer games, and [...] YouTube videos. I suggest that we add another rating to movies and computer games. The added movie and game rating would indicate how many years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown on the screen.

Now that you know I'm naive, I can share an even bigger innovation that will spread peace worldwide.

Employees must accept low wages to get affordable health insurance.

If politicians stop protecting these corrupt laws, wealthy business owners will stop funding their election campaigns.
