Script for video for LWV-OR Election-Method Informational Update

My name is Richard Fobes. I'm the author of this how-to book on creative problem solving. I'm proud to say that it has been published around the world in ten languages.

While writing this book I realized that most of the world's biggest problems have remained unsolved for so long because we use very primitive vote-counting methods.

In that book I included a one-paragraph description of a vote-counting method I created that would elect the correct candidate. Later I found out that a professor named John Kemeny had created a mathematically equivalent method. His method counts voter opposition, whereas my version counts voter support. To make a long story short, my version is now known as the Condorcet-Kemeny method.

Later, after writing a short book entitled "Hope For The Future," I wrote this book titled "Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections."

When I published this book about twelve years ago there were no names for the different kinds of ballots. Back then, academic articles just named the vote-counting methods. The verbs "rank" and "rate" and "vote" were used to refer to the process of collecting voter preferences. Or else the words "ordinal ballots" and "cardinal ballots" were used with the expectation that readers would know that ordinal refers to ranking and cardinal refers to rating.

Back then the name "ranked choice ballot" didn't exist, so in the printed edition I used the name "order-of-preference ballot." Later, in the ebook edition, I used the name "1-2-3 ballot." Now I use the name ranked choice ballot.

I also needed a name for the kind of ballot we use now, so I created the name "single-mark ballot." That name now appears in Wikipedia and other places. Currently I prefer the name "single-choice ballot." A few election-method experts prefer the name "choose-one ballot."

Ranked choice ballots can be counted in many ways, yet all the counting methods seem to agree that the preference levels can be named starting with "first choice" for the voter's favorite candidate, and second choice for the next-preferred candidate and so on.

In contrast there is disagreement about the best way to label the preference levels for rating ballots, which includes Score ballots. Some election-method experts prefer names such as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Acceptable, Poor, and Reject. Most other election-method experts prefer numbers for rating ballots, but there is not much aggreement about which numbers to use.

This issue becomes important regarding STAR voting. The number six on a STAR ballot indicates the voter's first choice, and the number zero indicates the voter's last choice, so STAR voting reverses the numbers regarding which is best and which is worst. The fans of STAR voting hope to resolve this incompatability by ending the use of ranked choice ballots. Of course that would be unreasonable because there are so many good ways to count ranked choice ballots but only one reasonable way to count STAR ballots.

Getting back to the topic of giving names to the elements of election methods, a big advantage of naming elements such as ballot type is that it becomes possible to use names to identify useful elements of otherwise flawed election methods.

The naming of elements is important because all the election methods used for government elections around the world are flawed. Yet within those methods there are useful elements.

A good example is that a region within Germany uses a voting method named Zweitmandat, which translates into English as "second mandate." The full Zweitmandat method is flawed because it does not collect enough information on the ballot. Yet the method includes a useful element that I described a dozen years ago in my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book. I did not give a name to that element. Only within the last year did I see that the element finally has a name. I don't know the German name, but apparently the English translation is "best loser" or "best near-winner."

Another important example of naming elements is the concept that I refer to as "pairwise vote counting."

Unfortunately pairwise vote counting is easily confused with the category name "Condorcet method." That's because most, but not all, Condorcet methods use pairwise vote counting. Conversely, some methods that use pairwise vote counting are not Condorcet methods because they do not always elect the Condorcet winner. Here's a diagram that clarifies this categorization.

With that background info, now you're ready to understand my favorite election method. I designed it and I call it VoteFair Ranking. It has many elements. Some of its elements have names, yet other elements remain unnamed.

The details of VoteFair Ranking are explained in my book, but I wrote that book for beginners, so here I'll attempt to summarize VoteFair Ranking by listing some of its notable elements.

* It uses ranked choice ballots.
* It uses pairwise vote counting.
* Nearly any way of marking a ranked choice paper ballot is countable.
* The Condorcet-Kemeny method is used for single-winner elections and as the basis for other calculations. In my book I refer to this part of VoteFair Ranking as VoteFair popularity ranking.
* The two biggest political parties, which can change over time, use primary elections to nominate two candidates each. This change defeats the money-based tactics that I'll explain soon.
* Each district is doubled in size and each such larger district elects two legislators.
* The two legislators are elected using VoteFair representation ranking, which functions similarly to the single transferable vote, but it's much fairer, and it defeats virtually all attempts to use tactical voting.
* The districts are enlarged a bit further to allow some seats to be reserved as statewide seats.
* Voters are asked to rank the political parties, or at least indicate their favorite party.
* As done in many European nations, party-based proportional representation calculations are done to identify how many statewide seats each party earns.
* The candidates who fill the statewide seats are determined using the "best loser" method.
* The elements I've just listed make use of both party-based and party-agnostic kinds of proportional representation.
* The voting methods used within parliaments and state legislatures also need to be dramatically improved. For this purpose I created something called VoteFair negotiation ranking. To test the method and demonstrate it I created the interactive website at NegotiationTool dot com. So far this method has not yet been used for any real-life negotiations.
* US presidential elections can use pairwise vote counting. State-by-state differences in weather and voter access can be handled using electoral votes to scale each state's pairwise vote count. For better fairness, ideally each state should get one fewer electoral vote compared to now. Obviously the people who now get assigned to cast electoral votes are not needed. The resulting pairwise counts from the 50 states are simply added together to create the nationwide pairwise vote count. Those pairwise vote counts easily reveal which presidential candidate is really most popular.

While I was designing VoteFair popularity ranking and VoteFair representation ranking I wrote software to do those calculations.

The first public use of that software was for a poll among students at what at that time was called the National College of Natuopathic Medicine.

(The students were told to assign numbers to six ways in which student-body fees could be used. Not surprisingly some students tried to assign numbers as if the numbers would be used as ratings on a score ballot, instead of as rankings on a ranked choice ballot. It was easy to convert those numbers to ranking preference levels. Since the Condorcet-Kemeny method calculates the full range of popularities from most popular to least popular, the results revealled the overall order of preference for the six kinds of student activities.)

Later I created the free survey service that still runs at VoteFair dot org. During the last fifteen years it has been used by many hundreds of clubs, school classes, business departments, and other groups of people around the world to elect or rank many kinds of choices.

An early user of that VoteFair service was the San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club. They used it to elect officers for their organization. The administrator of that election wrote these words: "Our organization has had several successful elections of club officers in the past few years, including an annual election a couple of weeks ago with the most candidates ever, and all the results have been recognized as very fair." The club also used it to select a new team name.

Starting in the second year of the TV show American Idol I hosted VoteFair American Idol polls. Each week typically hundreds of American Idol fans ranked the remaining contestants. At it's peak there were two thousand unique voters. The results were widely recognized to be much fairer than the official voting in which the contestant with the fewest votes was eliminated.

The testimonial page at the VoteFair website contains testimonials from user of that VoteFair Ranking software. My favorite testimonial says: "What you have created is very impressive and I believe has potential to revolutionize US voting and ultimately US and world history."

Of course the full VoteFair Ranking system is too advanced to be adopted all at once for use in governmental elections. Instead it needs to be adopted one or two elements at a time.

The first element that's needed is to adopt ranked choice ballots in general elections in a single state. Of course the counting method must be reasonably fair.

The second element that's needed is for the Republican party and the Democratic party to each nominate a second candidate who moves on to the general election. This change will defeat the money-based tactics now being used to corrupt election results.

My Ending The Hidden Unfairness book describes these money-based tactics. However in the book I did not name them. Lately I've been calling them blocking, concentration, and splitting.

A clear example of the blocking tactic arose in 2008, after I wrote that book. Many business owners who profit in ways that most voters dislike gave money to political action committees devoted to electing a Republican president. The election-method experts working for those political action committees apparently advised channeling lots of money to Barack Obama for the purpose of blocking Hillary Clinton from reaching the general election. That part of their tactic was successful. However, those experts, and the Republicans who perhaps unknowingly supplied that tactical money, were shocked to discover that their racism was not shared by the majority of voters. That was a clear example of the blocking tactic.

Vote splitting, of course, occurs when two or more similar candidates are liked by the majority of voters, but all of those similar candidates lose because voters have split their votes among those candidates. The money tactic that exploits this weakness is to give campaign contributions to the less-popular of the similar candidates. This tactic reduces the number of votes going to the most popular of the similar candidates, which reduces the number of votes needed for the money-backed candidate to win. The biggest campaign contributors use this vote-splitting tactic in the primary elections of both political parties. This tactic can be defeated by adopting ranked choice ballots and a good vote-counting method.

The money-based tactic named "concentration" is the opposite of splitting. Money is concentrated on a single candidate who has demonstrated a willingness to oppose the reforms that the majority of voters want. This concentration of money is arranged privately, not publicly. If there are extra candidates who also have demonstrated a willingness to ignore what the voters want, then money is withdrawn from the ones who have less chance of winning. This concentration of money allows the anti-reform candidate to win with less than 50 percent of the votes. As with vote splitting, this concentration tactic is used in the primary elections of both parties.

I have not seen any academic journal articles that research these money-based tactics. That's not surprising because university professors get most of their funding from government sources, and governments do not fund research that reveals the secret ways in which wealthy business owners control the government. As a result, few professors are actively researching better vote-counting methods.

This lack of academic journal articles also causes Wikipedia to lack coverage of better vote-counting methods. That's because the method either must be mentioned in a few academic journal articles or the method must be used in a significant governmental election.

To partially compensate for Wikipedia's limited coverage, a separate wiki at Electowiki dot org is where election-method experts maintain encyclopedic articles about election methods and election elements that do not yet qualify for appearance in Wikipedia.

Money is used to promote some vote-counting methods. Specifically the money behind the Center for Election Science is funding the promotion of Approval voting. And a wealthy person in Eugene is funding the promotion of STAR voting. And many people provide financial backing for the FairVote organization, which promotes instant-runoff voting, although under names that attempt to hide the fact that there are better ways to count ranked choice ballots.

Alas, those of us who best understand the mathematics behind vote-counting methods do not have financial backing to promote the best election methods.

These and related barriers account for why it's difficult to learn about the best vote-counting methods. Instead, money is available to block meaningful election-method reforms.

This blocking happened in the province of Ontario, in Canada, when the Ontario government created a citizens assembly to study election methods. The members of this assembly were randomly chosen from among a list of interested citizens. They were taught by a professor. But the professor was not neutral in what he taught. Apparently the professor steered them to favor a party list method. When the professor explained the difference between the closed party list and the open party list he used a slide that pointed out that closed party list systems are more common than open party lists. And it pointed out the closed party list ballot is simpler. What the professor failed to explain is that closed party list methods are common throughout Europe because the method increases the control of party insiders, so of course MPs (members of parliament) are given permission to vote in favor of adopting that method. The open party list gives more control to the voters, so of course party insiders tell their MPs to vote against adopting the open-list method.

Hopefully this example also helps to clarify why European nations and Australia and New Zealand are not the best models for election-method reform. They use vote-counting methods that were adopted for reasons that are not in the best interests of the voters. 

The case of Australia is important to consider. Decades ago it adopted ranked choice ballots and instant-runoff voting, although under the name "the alternative vote." Yet the results in Australia fail to demonstrate dramatic benefits because Australia also uses two other vote-counting methods. One of them is plurality voting, the one we use. The other is "the single transferable vote," which is a party-agnostic kind of proportional representation.

When their "alternative vote" ballots were adopted, Australian voters marked them according to which candidate they thought was best. But the results interacted with the results of also using plurality voting, and also using the single transferable vote. Problems arose because their political parties could not define their agendas in ways that made sense for all three kinds of ballots. So eventually the voters learned to favor candidates from the two biggest political parties, even in situations where they would actually prefer a candidate from one of the smaller parties.

Australia does offer evidence that the use of ranked choice ballots is reasonable. And that instant-runoff voting does not produce wildly bad results. But it does not offer evidence of what would happen if ranked choice ballots and instant-runoff voting were used for all elections.

Few other places around the world use ranked choice ballots and instant-runoff voting.

Scotland (?, look up) and Ireland (?) use the single transferable vote, which in the United States is promoted by the FairVote organization under the name "proportional ranked choice voting." This party-agnostic kind of proportional representation intentionally makes it easier for smaller political parties to win seats in the legislature.

Some people in the US, especially the FairVote organization, promote this method. But the evidence in Australia suggests that it would interact badly with the two-party system that has arisen from our use of single-choice ballots.

In my opinion it makes sense to first adopt election reforms that force both the Republican and Democratic parties to come under the control of the voters. This would be a dramatic change from the current arrangement where both parties are controlled by the biggest campaign contributors.

As an example, a majority of voters favor reducing mass school shootings even though the people who own businesses that sell guns and ammunition will earn less income. To oppose such reforms, those business owners donate huge amounts of money to candidates in both political parties. Of course those contributions are conditional on not voting in favor of laws that would reduce mass school shootings.

Elsewhere around the world ballot simplicity has been a high priority, so most governments use either single-choice ballots or something like Approval ballots where more than one choice can be marked. In some cases the choices are political parties. In other cases the choices are candidates and the party of the winning candidate is taken into account. In yet other cases the voters can vote for a party and also vote for candidates, which is the combination I recommend because that's what VoteFair Ranking does.

My point is that there are no governments anywhere in the world that demonstrate election methods that take control away from wealthy business owners and give full control to the voters.

The best election-method reforms would dramatically increase economic prosperity for the region that adopts such reforms. The last chapter of my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book explains this cause-and-effect link in detail. Specifically:

* Election-method reforms would reduce corruption, and corruption pulls down the overall economy.
* Fairer laws would increase optimism, which economists measure as consumer confidence, and that change increases consumer spending, and increases the motivation to earn more money.
* ...

History of digits zero through nine leading to dramatic gains in economic prosperity ....

Obviously the components of VoteFair Ranking cannot be adopted all at once. The components must be adopted one or two at a time.

The first step toward election-method reform that I recommend is to reform general elections in any state by adopting the election method named Ranked Choice Including Pairwise Elimination. This method, which is abbreviated as RCIPE and pronounced "recipe," has these characteristics:

* It uses ranked choice ballots.
* It eliminates candidates one at a time, in elimination rounds.
* In most cases the eliminated candidate is the one who is highest-ranked on the fewest ballots.
* If the elimination round includes a "pairwise losing candidate" and that candidate is different from the candidate who is highest-ranked on the fewest ballots, then the pairwise losing candidate is eliminated instead.
* The pairwise losing candidate is the candidate who would lose every one-on-one match against every not-yet-eliminated candidate.
* Nearly any way of marking a ranked choice paper ballot is countable.

Essentially the RCIPE method is the instant-runoff voting method with the addition of a safety net. This safety net prevents mistakes that can occur using traditional instant-runoff voting. The most notable such mistake happened in the 2009 mayoral election in Burlington Vermont.

I've written software that does RCIPE calculations and I've confirmed that under challenging combinations of ballots it yields results that bring it closer to better vote-counting methods such as the Condorcet-Kemeny method and Instant Pairwise Elimination, which estimates Condorcet-Kemeny results using an approach that eliminates one candidate at a time.

In other words, the RCIPE method compensates for the failure of instant-runoff voting to look deeply into all the preference information on all the ballots.

Those of us who are math-savvy election-method experts have known that ranked choice ballots and pairwise vote counting are needed to get the fairest election results. Lately many of us agree that the "margins" version of the Minimax method provides something close to ideal results. Lately this has become the default method used at the .... vote-counting service where users can choose from among different vote-counting methods.

I would gladly support the use of "Minimax with margins" or the "Minimax with winning votes" for use in governmental elections. For this purpose it would virtually always yield the same result as the Condorcet-Kemeny method, which looks into ballot data more deeply than any other method, which is why the method can require huge amounts of computation time when there are more than about twelve candidates.

write more later, and bring to close
