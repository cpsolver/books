Script for video for LWV-OR Election-Method Informational Update

My name is Richard Fobes. I'm the author of this how-to book on creative problem solving. I'm proud to say it's been published around the world in ten languages.

While writing this book I realized that most of the world's biggest problems have remained unsolved for so long because we use very primitive vote-counting methods.

Using my understanding of mathematics, which I learned while getting a bachelor of science degree in physics, I created a vote-counting method that I named VoteFair popularity ranking. It looks very deeply into the preference information on what are now called ranked choice ballots. I included a one-paragraph description of the method in that book.

Later I found out that a professor named John Kemeny had created a mathematically equivalent method. But his method counts voter opposition, whereas my version counts voter support. To make a long story short, my version is now known as the Condorcet-Kemeny method.

Later, after writing a short second book, I wrote this third book titled "Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections."

When I published this book about twelve years ago there were no names for the different kinds of ballots. Instead, back then, academic journal articles used verbs like "rank" and "rate," and adjectives like "ordinal" and "cardinal," but there were no self-descriptive names for the different kinds of ballots.

So I created the name "single-mark ballot" for the kind of ballot we use now. That name now appears in Wikipedia and other places. Currently I prefer the name "single-choice ballot."

I also created the name "order-of-preference ballot" because the name "ranked choice ballot" did not yet exist. However, in the second edition, I replaced that name with the name "1-2-3 ballot," which was suggested by another election-reform advocate.

This fact that election-method terminology is still evolving is very important. That's because some of the best ways to reform elections do not yet have names, or else have names are very new and unfamiliar.

In contrast, the best-known election systems used in Europe and Australia have familiar names. But all of those well-known election systems are flawed.

Yet within those election systems there are elements that are well-designed.

For example, a region within Germany uses a voting method named Zweitmandat, which translates into English as "second mandate." It's flawed because it does not collect enough information on the ballot. However, part of this method consists of a well-designed element. I described that element a dozen years ago in my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book, but I did not name that element. Within the last year I've learned that the element has a name, the English version of which is "best loser."

There's another element that I described in my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book without naming it. Now I use the self-descriptive name "pairwise vote counting." It consists of counting ranked choice ballots by focusing on one pair of candidates at a time.

Unfortunately pairwise vote counting is easily confused with the category name "Condorcet method." That's because most, but not all, Condorcet methods use pairwise vote counting, and most, but not all, methods that use pairwise vote counting are Condorcet methods. Here's a Venn diagram that shows how these terms are related, yet different.

My book describes an especially important element without naming it, and so far I haven't seen it used anywhere. In an upcoming list I'll refer to it as "two nominees each." This refers to a reform where the two biggest political parties, which currently are the Republican and Democratic parties, will nominate a second candidate to run in the general election. This means that a typical general election will include two Republicans, two Democrats, one candidate from each third party, plus any independent candidates who qualify.

Now you're ready to understand my favorite election method. I designed it, and I call it VoteFair Ranking. It has many elements. Some of its elements are still beginning to have names.

The details of VoteFair Ranking are explained in my book, but that book is 340 pages long. So here I'll just list some of its notable elements and categorizations.

* VoteFair Ranking uses ranked choice ballots.

* It uses pairwise vote counting.

* If a ranked choice paper ballot is marked in a way that's legible, then it's countable.

* For single-winner elections it uses what has become known as the Condorcet-Kemeny method.

* Primary elections will yield "two nominees each" from the two biggest political parties.

* It will use "dual-member districts." This means that each current district is doubled in size, and the enlarged district elects two legislators, instead of just one legislator.

* The second of these two legislators is elected using VoteFair representation ranking. This kind of ranking ensures that the second-seat winner represents the voters who are not well-represented by the first-seat winner.

* As a clarification, VoteFair representation ranking is a party-agnostic method that's similar to the single transferable vote in terms of what it accomplishes.

* The term party-agnostic means the method ignores political parties. This party-agnostic kind of proportional representation is different from another kind of proportional representation I'm about to explain.

* The districts are enlarged a bit further to allow some seats to be reserved as statewide seats.

* Voters are asked to rank the political parties, or at least indicate their favorite party.

* As done in many European nations, party-based proportional representation calculations are done to identify how many statewide seats each party earns.

* The candidates who fill the statewide seats are determined using the "best loser" method.

That list summarizes how VoteFair Ranking will elect mayors, governors, state legislators, and members of Congress.

Of course electing US presidents requires special consideration. State-by-state differences in weather and voter access will continue to be balanced using the numbers that are named electoral votes, although one fewer electoral vote per state will be fairer. The voters in most states will mark ranked choice ballots. These ballots will be counted using pairwise vote counting, with each state announcing its own pairwise vote counts. These counts will be scaled using the adjusted electoral votes, then these counts are simply added across all 50 states, and any good vote-counting method identifies the winner.

That's an extremely brief summary of VoteFair Ranking as I described it in my book.

Later I developed something called VoteFair negotiation ranking. I designed it for use by members of a legislature or parliament or Congress when they vote on proposed laws. I created the interactive website at NegotiationTool dot com to demonstrate how this method works.

When I was developing the VoteFair Ranking system, I wrote and debugged software to make sure that both the method and the software worked the way I expected. The latest open-source versions of this software I now keep available on Github in the CPSolver account, where CPSolver stands for creative problem solver (and not crossword puzzle solver).

The first public use of the early VoteFair Ranking software was for a poll among students at a school that was, at that time, named the National College of Natuopathic Medicine. The students wrote ranking numbers next to six spending categories for student-body funds. My software calculated the popularity of the categories from most popular to least popular. The published results were regarded as meaningful and useful.

Here I'll point out that unlike other methods, the Condorcet-Kemeny method always identifies the full popularity of all the candidates -- or choices of any kind -- from first-most popular, and second-most popular, and third-most popular, all the way down to least-popular. This full ranking reveals that it really does look deeply into all the preference information on the ballots.

After that first public use I created the vote-counting service that still runs at VoteFair dot org. That software runs automatically, for free, with no signup required. About 12,000 admin IDs have been issued. Occassionally I take a peek and see that it's been used by many clubs, student councils, and other organizations around the world to rank many kind of choices, including for electing officers.

An early user of that VoteFair service was the San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club. The admin for their elections wrote these words about using VoteFair Ranking: quote -- Our organization has had several successful elections of club officers in the past few years, including an annual election a couple of weeks ago with the most candidates ever, and all the results have been recognized as very fair -- unquote. In another message he said the club also used the service to select a new team name.

Starting in the second year of the TV show American Idol, I hosted VoteFair American Idol polls. At the poll's peak there were two thousand American Idol fans voting each week.

During the twelve years I hosted these polls, I gained many insights.

I learned that voter turnout increases when voters believe their vote can make a difference. In contrast, voter turnout decreases when non-voters don't expect to be able to outvote the other voters, or when non-voters regard the expected winner to be almost as good as their favorite.

Also I learned that some voters start out marking just one or two favorite contestants. But after seeing the weekly results, along with the pairwise vote counts, they realize that this attempt to vote tactically isn't giving them any extra influence.

And I learned that most voters quickly become comfortable ranking more and more of the contestants.

Of course there were other American Idol polls in which more fans voted. But those polls basically just asked "Who's your favorite?" It turns out that ranking the contestants yields much richer data, and that produces more meaningful results, even with fewer voters. In fact, a website named Idol Analytics stated that my VoteFair poll results were -- quote -- better than any other single index that I assessed -- unquote. FYI, the word "index" covered the temporarily useful tactic of measuring busy signals on the official voting phone lines.

A big advantage of pairwise vote counting is that anyone can look at the pairwise numbers and verify that their favorite was preferred by fewer voters than the winner.

This pairwise comparison was especially insightful during the third season of American Idol when Jennifer Hudson was eliminated way too early. As I explained in that week's commentary, her premature departure was caused by vote splitting and tactical voting. The vote splitting happened because in that season there were two other amazing singers who also were black and female. The tactical voting happened because the show had been announcing that these three singers had been getting the top number of votes, so that week lots of fans switched to voting for their second-favorite singer. After that week the show stopped announcing which singers were getting the most votes, and they focused attention on which singers were getting the fewest votes. Alas, news reports did not mention these kinds of insights. Instead they reported accusations of racism.

Hopefully you recognize that the same voting weaknesses that can undermine public opinion polls also undermine the fairness of governmental elections.

Naturally many people ask the question "How would election results change if we switched to a specific better vote-counting method?" Alas, we don't have access to the needed governmental election data.

In Australia where ranked choice ballots are widely used, the official election counts are only reported in the way that's needed for doing instant-runoff voting and the single transferable vote. Neither of these counting methods use pairwise vote counts. Yet the best vote-counting methods use pairwise vote counts, which means comparisons cannot be calculated.

Fortunately the software running at my VoteFair website has access to all the raw ballot data. It uses this data to also calculate who would win according to instant-runoff voting. These comparisons reveal that instant-runoff voting frequently fails to correctly identify the most popular contestant.

Of course the free voting service at VoteFair dot org is not the only such service. A professor at Cornell University maintains such a service under the name Condorcet Internet Voting Service. That service has handled thirty thousand polls over two decades. Those polls also include elections of officers in non-governmental organizations. That service allows the poll administrator to choose from several different kinds of Condorcet methods, with the current default being the Condorcet-Minimax method. Speaking of which, lately the Minimax method has been emerging as the most popular single-winner method among election-method experts.

These other ranking services, plus the wide availablity of open-source software running on countless servers for private use, means that better vote-counting methods are widely used. It just isn't yet happening in governmental elections.

As a clarification, I'm aware that the full Condorcet-Kemeny method is not yet a viable choice for governmental elections. That's because it looks so deeply into the ballot preference information that its computation time quickly increases as the number of candidates increases.

And I'll acknowledge that the full VoteFair Ranking system is too advanced to be adopted all at once. Instead it needs to be adopted one or two steps at a time.

The first step is to use ranked choice ballots in general elections, and count them with a method that's better than instant-runoff voting.

The second step is to adopt the "two nominees each" element. As a reminder this means that a typical general election will include two Republicans and two Democrats, plus third-party and independent candidates.

This simple change will defeat the most significant money-based tactics now being used to corrupt election results. My book describes these money-based tactics without naming them. Lately I've been calling them blocking, concentration, and splitting.

A clear example of the blocking tactic occurred in 2008, after I wrote that book. The election-method experts working for big-business-oriented political action committees steered lots of money to Barack Obama for the purpose of blocking Hillary Clinton from reaching the general election. That part of their tactic was successful. However, the experts and big-business donors were shocked to discover that their racism was not shared by the majority of voters. That was a clear example of the blocking tactic.

Vote splitting, of course, occurs when two or more similar candidates are liked by the majority of voters. The money tactic is to give campaign contributions to one or two of the least-popular of the reform-minded candidates, to keep them from dropping out of the race, which means these so-called "spoiler" candidates attract votes away from the most popular reform-minded candidate. This tactic reduces how many votes the money-backed candidate needs to win.

The money-based tactic named "concentration" is the inverse of splitting. Money is concentrated on a single puppet-like candidate who has demonstrated a willingness to oppose the reforms that the majority of voters want. This funding is arranged privately, not publicly. The tactic includes withdrawing money from any additional puppet-like candidates who have less chance of winning. So when you see a puppet-like candidate dropping out of a race, usually this is why it's happening.

The combined tactics of splitting, concentration, and blocking accounts for why both of the main candidates in general elections almost never include the reform-minded candidates that most voters would prefer.

I have not seen any academic journal articles that explain these money-based tactics. Nor have I seen any articles that research how well the various vote-counting methods defeat these tactics.

This isn't surprising. After all, university professors get most of their funding from government sources. The wealthy business owners who control governments around the world do not knowingly fund that kind of research. And tenure is unlikely to be given to a professor who wants to focus on such research. The result is a scarcity of academic journal articles about better vote-counting methods, and almost no research about which methods can best defeat money-based tactics.

As yet another barrier, these missing topics in academic journal articles causes a similar lack of knowledge on Wikipedia. Remember that vote-counting methods are mathematical, and Wikipedia editors are very vigilent about requiring references to peer-reviewed sources of information for mathematical articles.

To partially compensate for this limitation in Wikipedia coverage, a separate wiki is maintained at Electowiki dot org. Most of its articles are written and edited by election-method experts around the world who communicate through shared email messages.

Another issue regarding Wikipedia is that some of the election-method articles are a mess. For example, currently there's an article about plurality voting and a separate article about first-past-the-post voting, yet these are just two different names for the same vote-counting method.

When money is available, an organization can promote a specific method in ways that overcome some of these barriers. In the United States there are three organizations that have this level of funding. The Center for Election Science promotes Approval voting. The Equal Vote Coalition promotes STAR voting. The biggest one is the FairVote organization. That's FairVote, not VoteFair. They promote a specific version of instant-runoff voting, and they promote the method known in academic literature as the single transferable vote.

All three of these organizations try to hide the fact that there are yet better ways to count ranked choice ballots. This is partly why methods such as the Condorcet-Minimax method and the Condorcet-Kemeny method are not as widely known, even though they yield much fairer results. Hopefully I've made it clear that they are widely used, but just not in governmental elections.

Now I'll explain yet another way in which knowledge about the best vote-counting methods is blocked.

In Canada, the Ontario government created a citizens assembly to study election methods. The professor who taught the citizens about election methods steered them to favor a party list method. When he explained the difference between the closed party list method and the open party list method, he used a slide that pointed out that closed party lists are more common than open party lists. The slide also pointed out that the closed-list method is simpler for voters than the open-list method. Not surprisingly the citizens chose the closed party list to appear on the ballot initiative that was presented to Ontario voters. I helped some Canadians to defeat that seriously flawed ballot initiative.

Why is the closed party list method so popular? Because it increases the control of party insiders. So of course MPs (that's members of parliament) are given permission to vote in favor of adopting that method. In contrast, when a parliament is presented with the option of adopting the open party list, the party leaders tell their MPs to vote against it. That's because the open version shifts control away from party insiders toward voters.

So it's important to remember that when a government switches to a different vote-counting method, typically the newly adopted method simply does a better job of hiding its unfairness. Especially if the new method does not ask voters to rank candidates on ranked choice ballots.

In fact, most democracies around the world use the most primitive kinds of ballots. Either they use single-choice ballots or voters are allowed to mark more than one choice, but without being allowed to indicate which of their marked choices they like better.

Of course the situation in Australia is different. I mentioned that they use two different vote-counting methods that use ranked choice ballots. They also use plurality voting for some of their elections. Unfortunately Australian political parties are unable to shift their identities to fit these three different election methods. So although Australian voters initially marked their ranked choice ballots sincerely, after getting odd results they learned they need to vote tactically. Specifically they most often give the highest ranks to the candidates from the two or three biggest political parties.

This example demonstrates that in addition to adopting better ballots it's also essential to count these better ballots in ways that are compatible with other election methods still being used elsewhere in the state or nation.

When looking at the election systems of other nations, it's important not to assume that there is fairness just because there are fewer symptoms of unfairness. Specifically, it's easy to make the problem of gerrymandered districts disappear. And it's easy for political parties to add rules that increase the percentage of female politicians who get elected. Yet that doesn't mean that the majority of MPs better represent the voters.

As a more familiar example of this concept about symptoms of unfairness, the United States adopted primary elections to solve the obvious problem of vote splitting that was happening in what we now call general elections. Now the vote splitting happens in primary elections where it's more difficult to measure because the winner is always from the correct political party.

In the future, when general elections are using ranked choice ballots, and when they are counted in ways that prevent vote splitting, then political parties can go back to each party offering more than one candidate. This single change will defeat all three of the money-based tactics, namely blocking, splitting, and concentration.

Many election-method reformers assume that the Republican and Democratic parties cannot be forced into offering better candidates, so they promote election methods that make it easier for third-party candidates to get elected. Although such reforms can change who wins the elections for mayors and governors, those reforms would not change who wins the majority of legislative seats. In order to change which laws get passed in Congress, as well as in state legislatures, we need to end the money-based tactics of blocking, splitting, and concentration.

Now I'll shift to explaining yet another barrier that blocks better vote-counting methods.

Many election-method experts criticize their non-favorite methods by pointing to fairness criteria that the method [airquotes] "fails." These fairness criteria have names such as monotonicity, no favorite betrayal, and cloneproof. But the word "fails" just means that the method has a non-zero failure rate.

About five years ago I began pointing out the need to MEASURE the failure rates. In other words we need to know HOW OFTEN the method fails each fairness criterion. About a year ago I saw an academic journal article that acknowledges the need for this measurement approach. It calculated failure rates for a few methods, although not for the well-known fairness criteria because these are more challenging to measure.

About two years ago I began to write software that measures the failure rates for clone independence and independence of irrelevant alternatives for several single-winner election methods. I chose these two fairness criteria because they are the easiest to exploit using the money-based tactics of splitting and concentration.

Here's a scatter plot from the calculations. It shows that the RCIPE method I'll be talking about soon has smaller failure rates than instant-runoff voting and, of course, smaller failure rates than plurality voting. The plot shows that the Condorcet-Kemeny method has a very favorable balance between these two criteria. The data for STAR voting looks nice but that method would have higher failure rates in real elections because it's much more vulnerable to tactical voting. These calculations only simulate sincere voting.

These kinds of measurements are beginning to replace the excessive focus on whether a method has a zero failure rate or a non-zero failure rate for each fairness criterion. Instead we can identify which methods offer the lowest failure rates for the most important criteria.

I predict that when these better comparisons become possible, then the Condorcet-Kemeny method, compared to other single-winner methods, will become recognized as having the best balance of low and zero failure rates for the most important criteria.

In the meantime, the first step toward election-method reform that I recommend is to adopt, for use in general elections, the election method named Ranked Choice Including Pairwise Elimination. This method's name is abbreviated as R-C-I-P-E and pronounced "recipe."

This is the election method currently specified for the Ranked Choice Oregon ballot initiative.

The RCIPE method has these characteristics:

* It uses ranked choice ballots.

* It eliminates candidates one at a time, in elimination rounds.

* In most cases the eliminated candidate is the one who's highest-ranked on the fewest ballots.

* If the elimination round includes a "pairwise losing candidate" and that candidate is not the same as the candidate who is highest-ranked on the fewest ballots, then the pairwise losing candidate is eliminated instead.

* The pairwise losing candidate is the candidate who would lose every one-on-one match against every not-yet-eliminated candidate.

* Most importantly, nearly any way of marking a ranked choice paper ballot is countable. This includes marking two or more candidates at the same preference level.

Essentially the RCIPE method is the instant-runoff voting method with the addition of a safety net. This safety net prevents serious mistakes such as the one that happened in the 2009 mayoral election in Burlington Vermont.

In other words, the RCIPE method compensates for the failure of instant-runoff voting to look deeply into all the preference information on all the ballots.

Looking ahead farther into the future, the method known as the Minimax method would also work well. This election method has three variations, any one of which would be a good choice.

So in one sense the RCIPE method provides a stepping stone to the Minimax, Kemeny, and other better vote-counting methods, including proportional representation methods.

Now I'm going to shift to a broader perspective.

When the topic of election-method reform comes up, most people regard the topic as esoteric. Yet a big reason we, as humans, now have less warfare is that voting has replaced small-scale warfare. In fact voting arose from warfare. When two armies with the same weapons faced each other, both sides counted the number of enemy soldiers. Then the smaller army usually agreed to concede some of what it was fighting for.

Now, instead of soldiers fighting with weapons:

* courtroom lawyers fight with documents,

* Wall Street traders fight with buy and sell orders,

* politicians fight with words,

* citizens fight with marked ballots,

* and campaign contributors fight against voters using money-based tactics.

In most of these fights, the biggest conflicts are about money.

Yet when election-method reforms are promoted, some people say or think "let's not complicate how we vote" and "we already know how to count votes" and "if it were such a big advantage it would already have happened" and "I don't want to bother learning something new" and "we don't know what might go wrong if we change."

These are similar to the kinds of reactions that greeted Arabic numerals when they first arrived in Europe around the year 999, which is when Pope Sylvestor the Second was elected to become Pope. As a student he had learned how to use Arabic numerals so he could do math calculations incredibly fast compared to other Romans, who were still using Roman numerals.

Back then people fought against using multiplication tables and the digits zero through nine. They argued that "we already know how to count" and "we don't want to bother learning something new" and "that change isn't going to affect much" and Christian church leaders said "those Arabic numerals come from the enemy of our religion."

There are many parallels between that historical tipping point in Europe and what's happening today in the United States regarding pairwise vote counting. So here's a quick, admittedly incomplete, reminder of why adopting the digits zero through nine dramatically improved daily life for most citizens in Europe within a relatively short time.

During Medieval times European banking families basically couldn't hire non-family employees to do their accounting because that too easily led to embezzlement or accounting mistakes, or both. When Arabic numerals arrived it became practical for a bank to hire some accountants to track credits and hire other accountants to track debits. That became practical because calculations were done much faster than with Roman numerals. When the credits and debits did not match, the mistake was tracked to an accidental mistake or an attempt to embezzle. The result was less stealing and fewer accounting errors.

As a further advantage, calculating interest rates became practical. Keep in mind that multiplication or division using Roman numerals is almost impossible.

This change in banking, which first happened in Italy, increased the trustworthiness of the bigger banks. In turn, Italian merchants and traders were able to carry written documents instead of always carrying gold, silver, coins, and other valuables for payment. These written documents were useless to highway robbers, so highway robbery decreased. In turn, this increased the safety of travel between cities, which increased commerce. And it increased the sharing of knowledge between cities. This faster spread of products and knowledge led to the Scientific Revolution, which led to the Industrial Revolution, which eventually led to the modern technology we take for granted today.

Today we are at a similarly huge tipping point. Adopting pairwise vote counting will enable voters to elect the reform-minded politicians we want. In turn, those politicians will reform laws that, in turn, will dramatically increase widespread economic prosperity. And that prosperity increase will be as dramatic as what civilization experienced coming out of Medieval times.

The last chapter of my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book explains some reasons that fairer elections will increase economic prosperity. Here are a few reasons:

* Trust in government will increase because there will be fewer laws that favor aggressive big businesses who fight against consumers. Trust will lead to optimism, which economists measure as consumer confidence, and that change in attitude is known to boost the economy.

* More effort will be put into creating and growing the kinds of businesses that strengthen the overall economy, such as manufacturing and software development and product-design businesses, because these businesses will have lower tax rates. These kinds of businesses attract more money from other nations because they do work that's challenging for other nations to duplicate.

* Less effort will be wasted growing the kinds of businesses that undermine the overall economy, such as law firms and financial institutions on Wall Street, because these businesses will have higher tax rates. These kinds of businesses drain resources doing work that produces nothing that other nations want to buy.

* Consumers will not have to spend as much money buying products sold by businesses that currently overcharge their customers, such as pharmacutical companies, health insurance companies, and the sugar and artificial sweetener industries. With less money stolen from their wallets, consumers will buy other products and services they currently cannot afford to buy.

* Of particular interest to me is that patent laws will change to make it possible for individual inventors to make a living by inventing. This is the unfairness that shifted my path from becoming an inventor to becoming an internationally known creative problem solver, and then to become an advocate for election-method reform.

In other words, more college students will become inventors, entrepreneurs, and movie-makers instead of lawyers and bankers.

I find it ironic that the owners of big businesses don't yet realize that many of their biggest competitors are the owners of other big businesses who also give big campaign contributions to politicians. Each business owner who uses campaign contributions to get a law that favors their business is like a person cutting too big of a slice of economic pie. They neglect to notice that many other business owners are also cutting oversized slices of economic pie for their businesses. That leaves consumers with fewer dollars to spend on what those businesses sell.

From history we know that not fighting with physical weapons has left civilized people with more time and more resources. Peeking into the future, when businesses in different industries stop fighting each other for low tax rates and effective monopolies, less resources will be wasted on businesses that currently pay politicians to protect their excessive levels of income. With less waste, there will be increased widespread economic prosperity.

These future economic gains will be as dramatic as the gains that took Europe out of Medieval times. Alas, only in hindsight will it become clear that election-method reform was the tipping point.

Now that you better appreciate the importance of election-method reform, it's tempting to think there's no big hurry to adopt these reforms.

Alas, the longer we wait, the more suffering occurs. This isn't just an issue of economic suffering. And it's not just an issue about suffering here in the United States. In Afganistan, North Korea, Russia, and China there are countless children, women, and non-wealthy people who are suffering terrible oppression.

Recall that the Cold War with Russia ended because oppressed Eastern Europeans revolted because they saw dramatic economic prosperity in North America and Western Europe, and wherever else citizens were allowed to elect their leaders through voting.

In a similar way, the higher levels of widespread economic prosperity that will arise from adopting higher levels of democracy will inspire citizens in oppressed nations to demand higher levels of democracy in their nations.

Civilization has advanced dramatically by adopting the rule of law, where fighting is done using laws and legal documents, instead of fighting on battlefields with physical weapons. And civilization advanced dramatically by allowing citizens to vote for their leaders.

To reach even higher levels of civilization we need to remove the golden handcuffs from the hands of elected politicians so that they can pass the laws that a majority of voters want.

The first steps to make this happen are to adopt ranked choice ballots, to count them using pairwise vote counting, and to open up general elections to a second candidate each from the Republican and Democratic parties. This will be the tipping point that will dramatically increase a region's economic prosperity.

As I said at the beginning, most of the world's biggest problems have remained unsolved because currently we use very primitive vote-counting methods. 

Let's move beyond our primitive level of partial democracy to reach full democracy. The widespread economic rewards will be beyond what most people living today can imagine.

..............................

wording to use elsewhere:

Ranked choice ballots can be counted in many, many ways. Yet nearly always a paper version of a ranked choice ballot uses the familiar column labels "first choice," "second choice," and so on.

In contrast, rating ballots do not have a standard way to name the columns. Some election-method experts prefer names such as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Acceptable, Poor, and Reject. Most other election-method experts prefer numbers, but there is not much aggreement about which numbers to use.

This difference between ballot conventions would become important if STAR voting were to become widely adopted. That's because there are many good ways to count ranked choice ballots, but STAR ballots are incompatible with other rating methods. The promoters of STAR voting avoid mentioning this incompatability, and they hope that ranked choice ballots will stop getting used. Of course that's unreasonable.
