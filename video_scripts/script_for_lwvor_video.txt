Script for video for LWV-OR Election-Method Informational Update

My name is Richard Fobes. I'm the author of this how-to book on creative problem solving. I'm proud to say that it has been published around the world in ten languages.

While writing this book I realized that most of the world's biggest problems remain unsolved for so long because we use very primitive vote-counting methods.

So in that book I included a one-paragraph description of a vote-counting method I created that would elect the correct candidate. Later I found out that a professor named John Kemeny had created a mathematically equivalent method. His method counts voter opposition, whereas my version counts voter support. To make a long story short, my version is now known as the Condorcet-Kemeny method.

Later, after writing a short book entitled "Hope For The Future," I wrote this book titled "Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections."

When I published this book about twelve years ago there were no names for the different kinds of ballots. Back then, academic articles just named the vote-counting methods. The verbs "rank" and "rate" and "vote" were used to refer to the process of collecting voter preferences. Or else they refer to "ordinal" ballots and "cardinal" ballots and expect readers to know that ordinal refers to ranking and cardinal refers to rating.

So I needed a name for the kind of ballot we use now. I created the name "single-mark ballot." That name has been adopted in some places. But now I prefer the name "single-choice ballot." A few people prefer the name "choose-one ballot."

Back then the name "ranked-choice ballot" didn't exist, so in the printed edition I used the name "order-of-preference ballot." Later, in the ebook edition, I used the name "1-2-3 ballot." Now I use the name ranked-choice ballot.

Notice that the terminology for vote-counting methods is still evolving. The vote-counting methods have always had names. But now names also are being given to categories that span multiple vote-counting methods.

This simplifies discussing election-method reforms. Instead of needing to remember the characteristics of many dozens of election methods, we can refer to categories, such as which kind of ballot the method uses and the category of vote counting it uses.

As an analogy, consider that when lumber is fitted together with nails it becomes objects that have names, such as "doghouse" or "shed." But imagine if each piece of lumber, such as a two-by-four or a one-by-eight could not be named.

This concept of giving names to categories is important because the best combinations of vote-counting components have not yet been used in governmental elections.

For example, a region within Germany uses a voting method named Zweitmandat, which translates into English as "second mandate." The method is flawed because it does not collect enough information on the ballot. Yet the method includes a component that I described a dozen years ago in my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book. I did not give a name to that component. Only within the last year did I see the component finally has a name. That name translates into English as "best loser."

A more important component of better vote-counting methods is named "pairwise vote counting."

Alas, this pairwise counting method is easily confused with the category name "Condorcet method." That's because most, but not all, Condorcet methods use pairwise vote counting. Here's a diagram that clarifies that not all Condorcet methods use pairwise counting method, and that not all methods that use pairwise vote counting are Condorcet methods.

As a point of clarification the term "Condorcet method" refers to any method that always elects the Condorcet winner, if there is one. The Condorcet winner is a candidate who would win every one-on-one match against every other candidate.

With that background info, now you're ready to understand what my favorite election method is. I designed it and I call it VoteFair Ranking. It has many components. Some of its components have names, but other components don't yet have names.

The details of VoteFair Ranking are explained in my book, but I wrote that book for beginners, so here I'll attempt to summarize VoteFair Ranking by listing some of its notable components.

* It uses ranked choice ballots.
* It uses pairwise vote counting.
* Nearly any way of marking a ranked-choice paper ballot is countable.
* The Condorcet-Kemeny method is used for single-winner elections and as the basis for other calculations. That part I named VoteFair popularity ranking, before I found out about its equivalence to the method John Kemeny created.
* The two biggest political parties, which can change over time, use primary elections to nominate two candidates each. This change defeats the money-based tactics that I'll explain soon.
* Each double-sized district elects two legislators using VoteFair representation ranking. VoteFair representation ranking is better than, yet analogous to, the single transferable vote.
* Enlarging district sizes a bit further allows some seats to be reserved as statewide seats.
* Voters are asked to rank the political parties, or at least indicate their favorite party.
* As done in many European nations, party-based proportional representation calculations are done to identify how many statewide seats each party earns.
* The candidates who fill the statewide seats are determined using the "best loser" method.
* The components I've just listed make use of both party-based and party-agnostic kinds of proportional representation.
* The voting methods used in state legislatures and parliaments also need to be dramatically improved. For this purpose I created an interactive website at NegotiationTool dot com that demonstrates what I'm calling VoteFair negotiation ranking.
* US presidential elections can use pairwise vote counting. State-by-state differences in weather and voter access can by handled by using electoral votes to scale each state's pairwise vote counts. Those counts are simply added together to create the nationwide pairwise vote count. That reveals which candidate is really most popular.

Obviously these changes must be adopted one or two at a time, not all at once.

The first step toward election-method reform that I suggest, is to adopt the election method named Ranked Choice Including Pairwise Elimination, which is abbreviated as RCIPE, pronounced "recipe."

The RCIPE method has these characteristics:

* It uses ranked choice ballots.
* It eliminates candidates one at a time, in elimination rounds.
* In most cases the eliminated candidate is the one who is highest-ranked on the fewest ballots.
* If the elimination round includes a "pairwise losing candidate" and that candidate is different from the candidate who is highest-ranked on the fewest ballots, then the pairwise losing candidate is eliminated instead.
* The pairwise losing candidate is the candidate who would lose every one-on-one match against every not-yet-eliminated candidate.
* Nearly any way of marking a ranked-choice paper ballot is countable.

Essentially the RCIPE method is the instant-runoff voting method with the addition of a safety net. This safety net prevents mistakes that can occur using traditional instant-runoff voting. The most notable such mistake happened in the 2009 mayoral election in Burlington Vermont.

Australia has used instant-runoff voting, under the name "the alternative vote," for many decades. This long-term usage in governmental elections gives us evidence that the method does not often yield crazy or unfair results. Yet we can do better.

Instant-runoff voting fails to look deeply into all the preference information that voters mark on their ballots.

The next important concept is that all the vote-counting methods currently used by all the governments around the world are flawed.

That's because the members of parliament only vote in favor of a new election method if the leaders of their political party give them permission to adopt the change. Yet

the new law. In the case of school shootings, these people own businesses that sell guns and ammunition.

My Ending The Hidden Unfairness book describes these money-based tactics, but I did not name the tactics. Lately I've been calling them blocking, concentration, and splitting.

A clear example of the blocking tactic arose in 2008, after I wrote that book. Many business owners who profit in ways that most voters dislike gave money to political action committees devoted to electing a Republican president. The election-method experts working for those political action committees apparently advised channeling lots of money to Barack Obama for the purpose of blocking Hillary Clinton from reaching the general election. That part of their tactic was successful. However, those experts, and the Republicans who supplied that tactical money, were shocked to discover that their racism was not shared by the majority of voters. That was a clear example of the blocking tactic.

Vote splitting, of course, occurs when two or more similar candidates are liked by the same voters, and those voters split their votes among the similar candidates. The money tactic is to give campaign contributions to the less-populare of the similar candidates. That splits votes away from the more popular reform-minded candidate. This happens in the primary elections of both political parties. The reason this tactic works is that each voter can only mark the name of one candidate. This tactic can be defeated by adopting ranked-choice ballots and a good vote-counting method.

Concentration is the opposite of splitting. Money is concentrated on a single candidate, specifically someone who will oppose reforms after getting elected. This concentration of money is arranged privately, not publicly. If there is a second candidate who will oppose reforms, money is withdrawn from one of these two special-interest puppets. The result is a concentration of votes on the one candidate who will oppose what the majority of voters want, and that candidate will win. This tactic is used in the primary elections of both parties.
