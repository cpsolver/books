Script for video for LWV-OR Election-Method Informational Update

My name is Richard Fobes. I'm the author of this how-to book on creative problem solving. I'm proud to say that it has been published around the world in ten languages.

While writing this book I realized that most of the world's biggest problems have remained unsolved for so long because we use very primitive vote-counting methods.

Using my understanding of mathematics, which I developed while getting a bachelor of science degree in physics, I created a vote-counting method that looks very deeply into the preference information on ranked choice ballots. I included a one-paragraph description of the method in this book.

Later I found out that a professor named John Kemeny had created a mathematically equivalent method. His method counts voter opposition, whereas my version counts voter support. To make a long story short, my version is now known as the Condorcet-Kemeny method.

Later, after writing a short second book, I wrote this third book titled "Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections."

When I published this book about twelve years ago there were no names for the different kinds of ballots. Back then, academic articles used the verbs "rank" and "rate" and "vote" and sometimes they used the words "ordinal ballots" and "cardinal ballots."

In other words, back then the name "ranked choice ballot" didn't exist. So in the printed edition of my book I used the name "order-of-preference ballot." Later, in the ebook edition, I used the name "1-2-3 ballot." Now I use the name ranked choice ballot.

I also needed a name for the kind of ballot we use now. None existed. So I created the name "single-mark ballot." That name now appears in Wikipedia and other places. Currently I prefer the name "single-choice ballot."

Naming the few kinds of ballots is part of a bigger pattern of naming election-method elements. It's useful because those elemets can be fitted together in different ways, similar to the way Lego blocks can be fitted together to form different named objects.

Naming the best elements is important because so far all the governments in all the nations around the world use election systems that are flawed. Yet some elements within those voting systems can be fitted together to create great election systems.

As an example, consider the voting method named Zweitmandat, which translates into English as "second mandate." It's used in a region of Germany. It's flawed because it does not collect enough information on the ballot. Yet part of the method consists of a useful element that I described a dozen years ago in my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book. I did not give a name to that element. Only within the last year did I see that the element has a name. I don't know the German name, but apparently the English translation is "best loser" or "best near-winner."

Another important element is another concept I described in my book without giving it a name. Now I refer to it as "pairwise vote counting."

Unfortunately pairwise vote counting is easily confused with the category name "Condorcet method." That's because most, but not all, Condorcet methods use pairwise vote counting, and most, but not all, methods that use pairwise vote counting are Condorcet methods. Here's a Venn diagram that clarifies this categorization.

Now you're ready to understand my favorite election method. I designed it, and I call it VoteFair Ranking. It has many elements. Some of its elements have names, yet other elements remain unnamed.

The details of VoteFair Ranking are explained in my third book, but I wrote that book for beginners, and it's 340 pages long, so here I'll attempt to summarize VoteFair Ranking by listing some of its notable elements and categorizations.

* It uses ranked choice ballots.
* It uses pairwise vote counting.
* Nearly any way of marking a ranked choice paper ballot is countable.
* The Condorcet-Kemeny method is used for single-winner elections, and as the basis for proportional representation calculations.
* In my book I refer to this single-winner element within VoteFair Ranking as VoteFair popularity ranking.
* The two biggest political parties, whichever they are, will nominate the second-ranked candidate as their second candidate in the general election. Under current conditions this means there will be two Republicans and two Democrats in the general election. This change defeats the money-based tactics that I'll explain soon. I don't know of any other election method that includes this important characteristic.
* Yet another element is now named "dual-member" districts. This means that each current district is doubled in size, and each district elects two legislators who together represent the district.
* The second of these two legislators is elected using VoteFair representation ranking, which ensures the second-seat winner represents the voters who are not well-represented by the first-seat winner.
* VoteFair representation ranking is a party-agnostic method that's similar to the single transferable vote in terms of what it accomplishes.
* Party-agnostic means it ignores political parties, which is a different kind of proportional representation compared to what I'm about to explain.
* The districts are enlarged a bit further to allow some seats to be reserved as statewide seats.
* Voters are asked to rank the political parties, or at least indicate their favorite party.
* As done in many European nations, party-based proportional representation calculations are done to identify how many statewide seats each party earns.
* The candidates who fill the statewide seats are determined using the "best loser" method.
* Special considerations are needed for US presidential elections. State-by-state differences in weather and voter access can continue to be balanced using the numbers named electoral votes, although one fewer electoral vote per state would be fairer. Ranked choice ballots need to be used in most states. The resulting pairwise counts in each state will be scaled using the adjusted electoral votes. Then those pairwise counts are simply added across all 50 states. That approach easily and fairly reveals which presidential candidate is really the most popular.

That's an extremely brief summary of VoteFair Ranking as I describe it in my book.

Later I developed something called VoteFair negotiation ranking. I designed it for use by members of a legislature or parliament or Congress when they vote on bills. I created the interactive website at NegotiationTool dot com to test the method while I was developing it. Now that website serves to demonstrate how this method works.

That's a brief description of VoteFair Ranking.

I wrote software to do the calculations for VoteFair popularity ranking and VoteFair representation ranking. Most of the other calculations can be done using spreadsheets.

The first public use of the VoteFair software was for a poll among students at what at that time was called the National College of Natuopathic Medicine. The students wrote ranking numbers next to six spending categories for student-body funds, and my software calculated the popularity of those categories from most popular to least popular. Interestingly the Condorcet-Kemeny method always reveals this full sequence, unlike all other methods that by default just calculate a single winner. The ranking of those budget categories was regarded as meaningful and useful.

Later I created the free survey service that still runs at VoteFair dot org. During the last fifteen years it has been used by many hundreds of clubs, school classes, business departments, and other groups of people around the world to elect or rank many kinds of choices. I don't bother to monitor those uses, but when I take a peek at the ballot choices I do see that some are in foreign languages I don't understand. When the person who sets up the election, survey, or poll contacts me directly I get to find out about how they're using the VoteFair Ranking service.

An early user was the San Francisco Bay Area Curling Club. The admin for those elections wrote these words: "Our organization has had several successful elections of club officers in the past few years, including an annual election a couple of weeks ago with the most candidates ever, and all the results have been recognized as very fair." The club also used my online service to select a new team name.

Starting in the second year of the TV show American Idol I hosted VoteFair American Idol polls. Each week typically hundreds of American Idol fans ranked the not-yet-eliminated contestants. At its peak there were two thousand unique voters each week. The poll results were viewed by even more people. Testimonials about the results are posted on the VoteFair website.

My experience working with all this real-world data provides me with a deep understanding that goes beyond just focusing on mathematical characteristics. This data becomes even more valuable when you consider that the data from governmental elections using instant-runoff voting does not include pairwise vote counts. This limitation blocks us from meaningfully analyzing governmental election data.

I'm aware that the full VoteFair Ranking system is too advanced to be adopted all at once. Instead it needs to be adopted one or two elements at a time.

The first element that needs to be adopted within a state is to use ranked choice ballots in general elections and count them with a method that's better than instant-runoff voting.

The second element that's needed is for that state's Republican party and Democratic party to each nominate a second candidate who moves on to the general election. This change will defeat the money-based tactics now being used to corrupt election results.

My Ending The Hidden Unfairness book describes these money-based tactics. However in the book I did not name them. Lately I've been calling them blocking, concentration, and splitting.

A clear example of the blocking tactic occurred in 2008, after I wrote that book. The election-method experts working for big-business-oriented political action committees steered lots of money to Barack Obama for the purpose of blocking Hillary Clinton from reaching the general election. That part of their tactic was successful. However, the experts and big-business donors were shocked to discover that their racism was not shared by the majority of voters. That was a clear example of the blocking tactic.

Vote splitting, of course, occurs when two or more similar candidates are liked by the majority of voters. The money tactic is to give campaign contributions to the least-popular of the similar candidates. This tactic reduces the number of votes going to the most popular of the similar candidates, which also reduces how many votes the money-backed candidate needs to win.

The money-based tactic named "concentration" is the inverse of splitting. Money is concentrated on a single candidate who has demonstrated a willingness to oppose the reforms that the majority of voters want. This funding is arranged privately, not publicly. It includes withdrawing money from any additional puppet-like candidates who have less chance of winning.

The combined tactics of splitting and concentration in primary elections accounts for why both the main candidates in general elections almost never include the reform-minded candidates that most voters would prefer.

I have not seen any academic journal articles that explain these money-based tactics and which vote-counting methods are best for defeating these tactics. This isn't surprising because university professors get most of their funding from government sources, and the wealthy business owners who control the government do not knowingly fund that kind of research. The result is a scarcity of academic journal articles about this important topic, and about better vote-counting methods that can defeat the money-based tactics.

In turn, this lack of academic journal articles causes Wikipedia to lack coverage of these topics. That's because Wikipedia's rules about mathematical articles require references to peer-reviewed sources of knowledge.

As a result, non-professorial election-method experts write and maintain encyclopedic election-method articles at a separate wiki at Electowiki dot org.

The barrier against getting new vote-counting methods into Wikipedia has been overcome when a method's supporters get funding to promote the method. This situation applies to The Center for Election Science which promotes Approval voting, the FairVote organization which promotes a specific version of instant-runoff voting and the method known in academic literature as the single transferable vote, and the Equal Vote Coalition which promotes STAR voting.

Importantly, all three of these organizations try to hide the fact that there are yet better ways to count ranked choice ballots.

Those of us who best understand the mathematics behind vote-counting methods lack the funding to pay for any marketing or networking.

Hopefully you now better understand why it's difficult to learn about the best vote-counting methods.

Yet there is another way in which knowledge about the best vote-counting methods is blocked.

In Canada, the Ontario government created a citizens assembly to study election methods. The professor who taught the citizens about election methods steered them to favor a party list method. When he explained the difference between the methods known as the closed party list and the open party list, he used a slide that pointed out that closed party lists are more common than open party lists. Not surprisingly the citizens chose the closed party list to appear on the ballot initiative that was presented to Ontario voters. I helped some Canadians defeat the ballot initiative.

Why is the closed party list method so popular? Because it increases the control of party insiders. So of course MPs (that's members of parliament) are given permission to vote in favor of adopting that method. In contrast, when a parliament is presented with the option of adopting the open party list, the party leaders tell their MPs to vote against it because it shifts control from party insiders to the voters.

The important point is that vote-counting methods get adopted for reasons that are not in the best interests of the voters. This is part of why there is no nation that uses a great election system.

In fact, most nations use single-choice ballots or ballots that are marked similar to Approval ballots. This means that when voters can mark more than one choice they cannot indicate which of the marked choices they like better.

This brings us to the situation in Australia. They use three different kinds of vote-counting methods. Some of their elections use plurality voting, also called single-choice voting, which is what we use here in the US. Other elections use ranked choice ballots with instant-runoff voting, which they call "the alternative vote." Yet other elections use the multi-winner method that academic literature calls "the single transferable vote." The interactions between the three voting methods has led to some disappointing results because their political parties cannot align themselves with the three different election methods. So over time, Australians have learned not to mark their ballot sincerely, and instead they rank as highest the candidates from the two biggest political parties.

Australia offers evidence that if we adopt the single transferable vote here in the United States, it would become difficult for the Republican and Democratic parties to have identities that work for both kinds of voting.

Instead of trying to abandon the Republican and Democratic parties we should adopt election reforms that force both parties to come under the control of voters. This reform would reduce the influence of the biggest campaign contributors.

A clear example of the currently excessive influence of the biggest campaign contributors is that the people who own businesses that sell guns and ammunition are able to block laws that a majority of voters want for the purpose of reducing the frequency of mass school shootings.

The goal of election-method reform is to transform the United States, or any one of its states, from a partial democracy to a full democracy. No nation has yet made this transition because all nations use flawed election systems.

Some nations exhibit improvements such as not having gerrymandered districts and electing a higher percentage of women politicians. But these improvements occur because the unfairnesses are hidden or because some political parties have adopted rules that favor female candidates. They have not reached full democracy because money has more influence than votes.

Now I'll shift to understanding another barrier that blocks better vote-counting methods.

Many election-method experts criticize their non-favorite methods by pointing to fairness criteria that the method "fails." These fairness criteria have names such as monotonicity, no favorite betrayal, and cloneproof. But the word "failure" just indicates that the method has a non-zero failure rate.

About five years ago I began pointing out the need to MEASURE the failure rates. In other words we need to know HOW OFTEN the method fails each fairness criterion. About a year ago I saw an academic journal article that acknowledges the need for this measurement approach. It calculated failure rates for a few methods, although not for the well-known fairness criteria because they are more challenging to measure.

About two years ago I began to write software that measures the failure rates for clone independence and independence of irrelevant alternatives for a variety of methods being considered for use in Oregon. I chose these two fairness criteria because in my opinion they are the easiest to exploit using money-based tactics.

Here's a scatter plot from those calculations. It shows that the method I'll be talking about soon has smaller failure rates than instant-runoff voting and, of course, smaller failure rates than plurality voting. It shows that the Condorcet-Kemeny method has a very favorable balance between these two criteria. The data for STAR voting looks nice but that method would have higher failure rates in real elections because it's vulnerable to tactical voting.

These measurements are beginning to replace the excessive focus on whether a method has a zero failure rate or a non-zero failure rate for each fairness criterion. Many years ago mathematicians proved that it's impossible for any vote-counting method to have zero failure rates for all the criteria, so these measurements will provide a way to determine which methods offer the best balance between the various fairness rates.

I predict that when these better comparisons become possible, then the elements of VoteFair Ranking are likely to become recognized as having the best balance of low and zero failure rates for the criteria that are most important for both fairness and resistance to money-based tactics.

In the meantime, the first step toward election-method reform that I recommend is to adopt, for use in general elections, the election method named Ranked Choice Including Pairwise Elimination. This method's name is abbreviated as RCIPE and pronounced "recipe."

This is the election method currently specified for the Ranked Choice Oregon ballot initiative.

The RCIPE method has these characteristics:

* It uses ranked choice ballots.
* It eliminates candidates one at a time, in elimination rounds.
* In most cases the eliminated candidate is the one who is highest-ranked on the fewest ballots.
* If the elimination round includes a "pairwise losing candidate" and that candidate is not the same as the candidate who is highest-ranked on the fewest ballots, then the pairwise losing candidate is eliminated instead.
* The pairwise losing candidate is the candidate who would lose every one-on-one match against every not-yet-eliminated candidate.
* Nearly any way of marking a ranked choice paper ballot is countable. This includes marking two or more candidates at the same preference level.

Essentially the RCIPE method is the instant-runoff voting method with the addition of a safety net. This safety net prevents serious mistakes such as the one that happened in the 2009 mayoral election in Burlington Vermont.

In other words, the RCIPE method compensates for the failure of instant-runoff voting to look deeply into all the preference information on all the ballots.

Looking ahead farther into the future, the method known as the Minimax method would also work well. This method has three variations, any one of which would be a good choice.

So in one sense the RCIPE method provides a stepping stone to the Minimax and other better vote-counting methods.

Now I'm going to shift to a broader perspective.

Although I and other election-method experts talk about the importance of fairness, fairness is not the real issue. The real issue is money.

There will be huge gains in economic prosperity to any state or nation that adopts full democracy. The last chapter of my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book explains this cause-and-effect link in detail. Here are some highlights.

* Election-method reforms would reduce corruption, and corruption pulls down the overall economy.
* Fairer laws would increase optimism, which economists measure as consumer confidence, and that change increases consumer spending, and increases the motivation to earn more money.
* ... [finish writing]

Most people seem to assume that the link between economic prosperity and vote counting is esoteric. When pairwise vote counting is presented as a better way to count ballots, some people say "let's not complicate how we vote" and "we don't know what might go wrong if we change" and "let's try this new method that another place just adopted" and "we already know how to count votes" and "if it were such a big advantage it would already have happened" and "I don't want to bother learning something new."

These are similar to the kinds of reactions that greeted Arabic numerals when they first arrived in Europe around the year 999, which is when Pope Sylvestor the Second was elected to become Pope. As a student he had learned how to use Arabic numerals so he could do math calculations incredibly fast compared to other Romans. That's because at that time most Romans were still using Roman numerals.

The seemingly small innovation of using the digits zero through nine, plus multiplication tables, had huge unexpected benefits. In particular, Italian banking families were able to hire non-family employees to do their accounting. That's because the faster calculations allowed a bank to hire some accountants who tracked credits and hire other accountants who tracked debits. When the credits and debits did not match, the mistake was tracked to an accidental mistake or an attempt to embezzle. The result was less stealing and fewer accounting errors, which increased the trust in banks. In turn, increased trust led to dramatically increased travel between cities because traders and wealthy individuals were able to trust written documents instead of having to carry gold, silver, coins, and other valuables for payment. The documents were useless to highway robbers, which made travel between cities safer.

The resulting wealth from banking fueled the creation of art during the Italian Renaissance. The increased travel led to inventions that fueled knowledge that led to the Scientific Revolution, which in turn led to the Industrial Revolution, which eventually led to the modern technology we take for granted today.

So now we are at a similarly huge tipping point. Adopting pairwise vote counting will enable voters to elect the reform-minded politicians we want. In turn, those politicians will reform laws that, in turn, will dramatically increase widespread economic prosperity. And that prosperity will be as dramatic as what civilization experienced coming out of Medieval times, and before that when civilization adopted the idea of fair laws and court trials.

Specifically here are some reasons that fairer elections will increase economic prosperity:

* It will reduce corrupt laws, which basically steal money from our wallets.

* Business tax rates will increase for businesses that are not difficult to do yet are burdens on the economy, such as the financial institutions on Wall Street.

* Business tax rates will decrease for businesses that are challenging to do and attract income from outside the region, such as manufacturing and software development and product-design businesses.

* Trust in government will increase, which will increase consumer confidence, which economists measure because of it's known to increase economic prosperity.

Other reasons are explained in the last chapter of my Ending The Hidden Unfairness book.

It's tempting to think that election reform can wait a bit longer. Alas, the longer we wait, the more suffering occurs. Not only in the US economy. Countless children, women, and non-wealthy people living outside the US are suffering in worse ways. Recall that the Cold War with Russia ended because their oppressed citizens revolted after seeing evidence of the prosperity in North America. In a similar way, full democracy in the US will lead to widespread economic prosperity that inspires people living in other nations to reach higher levels of democracy. This becomes especially powerful as a way to defeat the oppression going on in Afganistan, North Korea, Russia, and China.

As I said at the beginning, most of the world's biggest problems have remained unsolved because currently we use very primitive vote-counting methods. Humans have become much more civilized by fighting in courts instead of on battlefields. But wealthy business owners too easily control which laws are passed, and which laws are blocked. They accomplish that control by exploiting our planet's primitive methods of voting.

Let's move beyond our primitive level of democracy to full democracy. The rewards will be beyond what most people can imagine.

..............................

wording to use elsewhere:

Ranked choice ballots can be counted in many, many ways. Yet nearly always a paper version of a ranked choice ballot uses the familiar column labels "first choice," "second choice," and so on.

In contrast, rating ballots do not have a standard way to name the columns. Some election-method experts prefer names such as Excellent, Very Good, Good, Acceptable, Poor, and Reject. Most other election-method experts prefer numbers, but there is not much aggreement about which numbers to use.

This difference between ballot conventions would become important if STAR voting were to become widely adopted. That's because there are many good ways to count ranked choice ballots, but STAR ballots are incompatible with other rating methods. The promoters of STAR voting avoid mentioning this incompatability, and they hope that ranked choice ballots will stop getting used. Of course that's unreasonable.
