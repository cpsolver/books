<h1><font size="+4">I</font>ntroduction</h1>

<p>We are living in challenging times, full of problems.  Each day in the news we hear the latest information about scandals, murders, bombings, mass shootings, terrorism, ethnic wars, epidemic diseases, radioactive contamination, malnutrition, pollution, poverty, homelessness, inflation, layoffs, corporation bailouts, government insolvencies, global warming, and overpopulation.  It's not surprising that countless people are pessimistic about the future.</p>

<p>In contrast, as the author of <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>, I'm optimistic about the future.  Using my skills of creative problem solving I can see solutions to the problems we face.  It's as though I find myself standing at the top of a hill where I can see both the past and the future.  On the future side I see specific solutions to the problems we face.  In the following pages I'm sharing a few of the solutions I see.</p>

<p>What credibility do I have for forecasting the future?  I began designing and building a personal computer starting in 1974, before the first Apple computer was sold, and even before the first 8-bit microprocessor became available.  I wrote the second screen-oriented text editor, and later published that software in BYTE magazine.  I anticipated <i>electronic cameras</i>, now known as digital cameras, in the late 1960's.  And there are other examples that are not as easy to describe.</p>

<p>In the following pages I am sharing three innovations that eventually will be adopted to solve, or partially solve, the following three challenging problems:</p>

<ul>

<li>Crime</li>

<li>Economic recession</li>

<li>Warfare</li>

</ul>

<p>My purpose in sharing these solutions is to convince you that even the most challenging problems can be solved using the skills of creative problem solving.  Then you will recognize that the skills of creative problem solving also can be used to create solutions to whatever problems you want to solve, whether at work or at home.</p>

<p>Learning the skills of creative problem solving requires effort, just as climbing a hill requires effort.  Yet the effort brings worthwhile rewards, namely solutions to the problems you face.  Also, if your job is to solve problems&mdash;which applies to most professionals&mdash;then the skills also will bring you financial rewards.  Plus, you can enjoy the splendid view of the future that awaits you at the top of the hill.

<h1><font size="+4">C</font>hapter 1: Reducing Crime by Adding a Years-In-Prison Movie Rating</h1>

As a partial solution to the problem of crime, I propose adding a Years-In-Prison (YIP) rating to theater and TV movies.  The YIP rating would roughly indicate the number of years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown in the movie.</p>

<p>The YIP rating would help teenagers, young adults, and high-school dropouts learn the relative level of acceptance of so-called &ldquo;adult&rdquo; behaviors.  Consider that young people now get confused messages such as these:</p>

<ul>

<li>Teenagers notice that some R-rated activities&mdash;such as the use of profane language&mdash;are done by many adults.  This can lead to the impression that other R-rated activities&mdash;such as sex outside of marriage and blood-and-guts violence&mdash;are also somewhat acceptable when done by adults.</li>

<li>Legal behaviors such as profanity in private, and healthy behaviors such as nudity when taking a shower, are limited to &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; movies, while illegal and unacceptable behaviors such as murder, assault, corruption, and theft are frequently shown in family television programs.</li>

<li>The existing rating systems group rape, marital sex, and prostitution into the same &ldquo;restricted&rdquo; category.  This makes the violent crime of rape seem more acceptable than it is, and fails to convey that sex between a husband and wife is legal and healthy while prostitution is illegal and unhealthy.</li>

</ul>

<p>Very importantly the YIP rating is in addition to&mdash;not a substitute for&mdash;existing movie ratings (G, PG, R, TVMA, V, S, L, etc.).  The existing ratings are still needed to help keep children from seeing activities they aren't yet ready to learn about.</p>

<p>Notice that the YIP rating conveys the content of movies in a useful and meaningful way.  And it avoids the complications (and hazards) of censorship.</p>

<p>Of course existing laws are not always the best indication of what people should and shouldn't do.  For example, it is illegal for an automobile driver to drive with their seat belt unbuckled and toss trash out the car's window, yet utility companies can operate nuclear power plants in spite of safety violations and can accumulate radioactive waste without any safe place to put that waste.  YIP ratings would focus more attention on these gaps between laws and ethics, and that would lead lawmakers to bring laws into closer alignment with the principles of ethics.  The resulting increased respect for laws would undermine any respect that some criminals now get for violating unfair laws.</p>

<p>Potential disadvantages in the Years-In-Prison movie-rating idea can be avoided by designing it wisely.  For example, the rating can convey uncertainty by using ranges of numbers, such as conveyed in the following sample rating: YIP 130-280.  Acts of warfare are not illegal, so they could be kept separate, such as: YIP 130-280 +WAR 4K-7K (where K indicates thousands).  For use in advertisements an abbreviated form such as YIP 800 could be derived from the full rating.</p>

<p>The YIP rating does have the disadvantage of being an extra rating to include in movie reviews and advertisements, but aren't inexpensive ways of preventing crime worth considering?</p>

<h1><font size="+4">C</font>hapter 2: Increasing Economic Prosperity by Adding a Second Kind of Patent</h1>

<p>As a partial solution to the problem of the global economy not being as strong as it could be, I recommend adding a second kind of patent, perhaps called the &ldquo;open patent&rdquo;.  It would be designed for individual inventors who want to share, instead of monopolize, their inventions.  The conventional &ldquo;monopoly patent&rdquo; would continue to be available to individual inventors who want to monopolize their ideas.</p>

<p>The existing patent system acts as an unintended barrier to the flow of ideas from individual inventors' minds to marketplace products.  Consider the case of a woman who came up with an idea for a simple invention and called a large manufacturing corporation, described the idea, and asked if they were interested in manufacturing the invention.  They said they would consider buying the rights to her idea if she were to get a patent.  But the cost of getting a patent is more than a thousand dollars.  As a professional singer she can't afford that cost.  A different woman did successfully obtain a patent, but she had to mortgage her family's house to afford to do so.  When she said she was getting an idea for another invention her husband said, &ldquo;Get it out of your mind!  I don't want to deal with another one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>How would increasing the number of inventions improve the economy?  Each new invention offers the potential of a new product in the marketplace, adds jobs for manufacturing and marketing the product, and provides lucrative new investment opportunities.</p>

<p>More broadly, inventing is a wealth-creating activity and an economy prospers more from wealth-creating activities than from wealth-shifting and resource-maintenance activities.  Besides inventing, other wealth-creating activities include manufacturing, product design, farming, film making, music composing, software development, and book writing.  Examples of wealth-shifting activities include the work done by bankers, insurance professionals, lawyers, and real estate investors.  Examples of resource-maintenance activities include the work done by doctors, police officers, and wastewater treatment employees.  Notice that only wealth-creating activities produce what can be sold or exported, so they contribute the most to the economy.</p>

<p>Why would an inventor choose to share his or her invention instead of monopolizing it?  The inventor could gain access to higher-paying jobs by listing the patent on his or her resume.  Also, inventors who share their ideas would become eligible to win monetary awards given for the best open-patented inventions.  Furthermore, many inventors would rather continue using their creativity to create more inventions instead of dealing with the challenges of manufacturing and marketing the new product, and suing infringers.</p>

<p>Adding this second kind of patent would significantly increase the burden on the patent office.  Yet this burden can be financed by requiring a small royalty from businesses that manufacture open-patented products.  To reduce the number of inappropriate open-patent applications, a small registration fee of about $150 would be required.  Also required would be a refundable deposit of about $400.  The refundable deposit would be kept only if the inventor failed to recognize that the idea is unpatentable or to discover that it has already been patented.</p>

<p>The biggest disadvantage of adding a second kind of patent is that it complicates international patent law.  Yet the effort to revise international patent law would lead to such a dramatic improvement in the worldwide economy that the efforts would be very worthwhile.</p>

<h1><font size="+4">C</font>hapter 3: Reducing Warfare by Adopting Advanced Methods of Voting</h1>

<p>Eventually civil warfare will be eliminated, and warfare between countries will be reduced, by adopting methods of voting that are more advanced than the primitive voting methods now in use around the globe.</p>

<p>Current voting methods allow 51 percent of a population to tell the other 49 percent what they can and cannot do.  (Through media ownership, control of voting laws, and financial backing of candidates, less than 50 percent of a population can control the population.)  A government based on this traditional voting method works fine if there are no strong cultural differences such as differences in race, religion, or language.  And such a government can appear to work fine if all the minorities are small enough to be suppressed through laws and physical force.  But internal conflicts arise if the majority oppresses a minority that is large enough to pose a physical threat to the majority.  The result can be rebellion that can escalate into civil warfare.</p>

<p>Civil warfare also can erupt when none of the cultural groups constitutes a clear majority or when two groups are nearly equal in number.  In these cases attempts to vote on controversial issues either result in deadlocks or result in clearly unrepresentative results.  As an example, if a Northern Ireland parliament were to vote on whether to allow or disallow divorce, the result would be unrepresentative regardless of the outcome.  A decision to outlaw divorce would anger Protestants and a decision to allow divorce would anger Catholics.</p>

<p>Yet civil warfare&mdash;and the oppression that ignites it&mdash;can be avoided.  Doing so requires methods of voting that produce compromises that accommodate the needs&mdash;but not necessarily the preferences&mdash;of the diverse cultures.  Traditional methods of voting do not produce such results.</p>

<p>Improvements in voting would arise from using the voting method called <i>VoteFair ranking</i>.  In this method, a voter indicates not only his/her first choice, but also indicates his/her second choice, third choice, and so on.  (The last choice is the candidate left over.)  Using a tallying process explained in <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i> (pages 222-227) (and in the recently published <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i>) an overall order of preference is determined.  The candidate in first place wins the election.  The results would be much fairer than current voting methods, which often fail to correctly identify the most popular candidate.</p>

<p>Yet another voting method called <i>priority voting</i> could be used in legislatures (such as parliaments, congresses, etc.) to improve voting on issues.  Each representative would indicate for each issue, out of a number of issues, whether he/she favors or opposes the suggested change, and would indicate how strongly he/she supports that position.  A wisely designed tallying process (such as the one at <a href="http://www.NegotiationTool.com">www.NegotiationTool.com</a>) can consolidate such votes into a single overall indication of which issues are resolved in which ways.</p>

<p>Using priority voting to vote on issues would produce outcomes that are more representative than what current voting methods now produce.  Specifically, deadlocks are currently avoided by using awkward&mdash;and easily manipulated&mdash;techniques such as &ldquo;trading of votes&rdquo; and &ldquo;log rolling&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Priority voting requires multiple rounds of voting.  This allows the representatives to adjust their votes in an attempt to make the outcome more representative.  Between rounds of voting some of the issues could be subdivided.  As an example of subdividing an issue, again consider the divorce issue in Northern Ireland.  Instead of only considering whether to allow or disallow divorce, the issue could be subdivided into separate issues such as prohibiting divorce in some situations (such as when the wife is pregnant or has very young children, or if the wedding ceremony was performed in a church that does not recognize divorce) and allowing divorce in other situations.</p>

<p>Initially, advanced methods of voting could resolve civil wars such as the conflict in Northern Ireland.  Voting advances also can resolve the conflict between French-speaking Quebec and the rest of Canada, which speaks English.  Within the United States advanced methods of voting could prevent violence in the state of California where the previously dominant race&mdash;white people&mdash;will soon become a minority.</p>

<p>Further advances in voting methods, beyond the ones described above, would increase the ability of the United Nations to promote peace.  Although warfare between countries will not fully disappear within the next two centuries, continued voting innovations, if wisely implemented, can reduce warfare throughout the globe.  Perhaps eventually, after historic angers have been forgotten, even the conflict between Arabs, Jews, and Christians over the tri-holy city of Jerusalem might be resolved using extremely fair methods of voting.</p>

<p>[The book <i>Ending The Hidden Unfairness In U.S. Elections</i> contains detailed explanations about the advanced voting methods that will increase fairness and resolve long-lasting conflicts around the globe.]</p>

<h1><font size="+4">C</font>onclusion:<br />Seeing Solutions</h1>

<p>Here is a summary of the three solutions explained in this book:</p>

<li>Crime can be reduced by adding a Years-In-Prison movie rating.  The rating would indicate the number of years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown in the movie.</li>

<li>Global economic prosperity can be increased by adding a second kind of patent that meets the needs of creative individuals who want to share, instead of monopolize, their inventions.</li>

<li>Civil warfare can be eliminated, and warfare between nations can be reduced, by adopting voting methods that are more advanced than the primitive methods now in use around the globe.</li>

</ul>

<p>These glimpses of solutions to seemingly insolvable problems gives us confidence that solutions also exist for solving other difficult problems.  This knowledge that solutions exist gives us hope for the distant future.</p>

<p>The existence of solutions for especially challenging problems also implies that surely solutions exist for whatever problems you want to solve.  Solutions are waiting for you on the other side of the hill that separates your past from your future.  Hopefully this awareness of waiting solutions will now motivate you to invest the effort needed to climb the hill.  You can climb this hill by learning the skills of creative problem solving.  The view of the future from the top of the hill is delightful!</p>
