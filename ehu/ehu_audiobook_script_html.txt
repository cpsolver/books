<h1>Part One:&#160; Getting Oriented</h1> 

<h1>Chapter 1:&#160; The Slime:&#160; Following The Political Money Trail</h1> 
<p>In this chapter let's follow the trail of money in politics to see where it leads.&#160; As you will soon see, the trail leads into backroom meetings of committee members who are chosen by political-party leaders who, in turn, are heavily influenced by campaign contributions.</p> 
<h1>Disease Of Cashus Influentious</h1> 
<p>A disease called <i><b>cashus influentious</b></i> has quietly infected U.S. politics, and it now clogs the workings of democracy in the United States.&#160; To learn more about this disease, let's take a journey into the back rooms of politics.</p> 
<p>It is in these back rooms that money is used to choose which people appear on the ballot.&#160; As a result, the people you would really like to vote for don't even appear on the ballot.&#160; Whoever you vote for has already been approved by the people who use money to control politics.&#160; This is why the actions of Governors, state legislatures, Congress, and the U.S. President are heavily influenced by people and corporations with lots of money.</p> 
<p>The result is a big focus on passing laws that increase corporate income through tax breaks, government subsidies, and monopolies.&#160; These unethical ways of increasing corporate income are not appreciated by a majority of voters.&#160; Why?&#160; Because those voters are the taxpayers and consumers who pay for these tax breaks, government subsidies, and monopolies.</p> 
<p>Voters watch in frustration at the effects of cashus influentious.&#160; Voter frustration increases while politicians fail to restore the former high quality of U.S. public education, fail to dramatically reduce crime, fail to make health care affordable, fail to protect the environment, and continue to behave in ways that are frequently unethical.</p> 
<p>When voters finally succeed in getting Congress to pass a new law that sets limits on financial contributions, the law fails to reduce the influence of money in elections.&#160; Alas, as time passes it becomes clear that powerful politicians figured out ways to get around the new law before it was even passed.</p> 
<p>As we investigate the dark side of elections, let's not forget the ideal of democracy; the one we learned about in school.&#160; In an ideal democracy, elections provide a fair process in which citizens, in their role as voters, can select government officials who are motivated to do what the voters want.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately the United States uses primitive voting methods that make it easy for cashus influentious to thrive.&#160; Fortunately there is a cure for cashus influentious.&#160; The cure involves adopting fairer voting methods.&#160; You'll learn about these voting methods in Part Three.</p> 
<p>To better appreciate the cure for cashus influentious, let's first understand the symptoms of the disease.</p> 
<h1>Paying For Access</h1> 
<p>Suppose there is a politician named Clif Clifford.</p> 
<p>Clif lives in Ohio and is finishing his second term as a state representative in the Ohio legislature.&#160; Now he wants to go to Washington DC as his district's Representative in the U.S. House of Representatives.&#160; Clif is a Democrat, so his first challenge is to win the Democratic primary election for that seat in Congress.</p> 
<p>At a fund-raising event, Clif is introduced to Lester Seedum.</p> 
<p>Lester says &#8220;I'm from an organization named Citizens for Superior Foods, and the members of our organization would like to donate a total of &#36;5,000 to your election campaign.&#8221; Clif is delighted and says he is certainly in favor of food improvements.</p> 
<p>Lester continues by saying &#8220;Our organization is opposed to the recently proposed requirement for indicating whether food ingredients are from genetically engineered plants.&#8221; When Clif noncommittally says &#8220;I see,&#8221; Lester explains &#8220;Using produce from genetically engineered plants results in lower food prices.&#160; But the stricter labeling requirements will increase the price of all labeled food.&#8221; To the question &#8220;What is your organization's position regarding the safety and nutritional concerns that many consumers have?,&#8221; Lester replies &#8220;Those claims are not supported by any research results, and, in fact, research shows that genetically modified plants provide food that is completely safe, without any loss of nutritional value.&#8221;</p> 
<p>Clif knows there is no need to make any decision at this time about how he will vote on this issue.&#160; At this point both men know that Lester is simply ensuring that if Clif wins, Clif will be more receptive to meeting and talking with Lester when he calls Clif's office.</p> 
<h1>Funding Both Sides For Guaranteed Access</h1> 
<p>What Lester doesn't mention to Clif is that Citizens for Superior Foods has donated even more money &#8212; &#36;10,000 &#8212; to one of Clif's opponents in the other political party.&#160; Why donate money to candidates in both political parties?</p> 
<p>Let's suppose that Clif's Congressional district has somewhat of a balance between Republican and Democratic voters.&#160; This balance makes it difficult for campaign contributors, such as Citizens for Superior Foods, to predict whether the general election will be won by a Republican or a Democrat.&#160; <b>Donating money to one candidate in each of the two primaries helps to defeat the other, less-liked, primary candidates</b>.&#160; In this example, Citizens for Superior Foods prefers that the Republican recipient of their money wins the Congressional seat, but they are giving money to Clif for the purpose of defeating his Democratic rivals.&#160; This decision is based on the knowledge that one of Clif's strongest Democratic competitors is in favor of the food-labeling law they oppose.</p> 
<p>An added bonus of contributing money to candidates in both political parties is that, regardless of the outcome, the organization gets better access to whichever politician wins.</p> 

<p>Up until the mid-1900s business owners and wealthy individuals tended to support Republican candidates more heavily than Democratic candidates because the Republican candidates shared more of the goals of the wealthy.&#160; In contrast, Democratic candidates heavily depended on contributions from labor unions and less-wealthy individuals.&#160; But voters tended to elect Democrats more often than wealthy contributors could accept.&#160; After awhile, wealthy people realized that it was in their best interests to also give financial support to Democratic candidates.&#160; This way, regardless of which candidate won, wealthy contributors could go to the elected official and say &#8220;I contributed lots of money to your election campaign; could we talk for a few minutes?&#8221;</p> 
<p>In case you need an actual example to latch your mind onto, consider the case of one company, Archer Daniels Midland, that, during a single election, gave more than &#36;480,000 to the Democrats and more than &#36;345,000 to the Republicans.&#160; What were the benefits?&#160; This company has most of the market for a particular manufactured substance (ethanol) and receives enormous tax subsidies that, over a five-year period, cost taxpayers about &#36;3,600,000,000 (more than three billion dollars)!</p> 
<p><b>Campaign contributions to candidates of both the Republican and Democratic parties are quite affordable because there are only two political parties to which donations need to be made</b>.&#160; Major contributors seldom donate money to third-party candidates because those candidates rarely win elections.</p> 
<h1>Senators Are Even More Expensive</h1> 
<p>How much money in campaign contributions does it take to get elected to the U.S. House of Representatives?&#160; It costs about one million dollars.</p> 
<p>Compared to members of the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senators are even more influenced by money.&#160; The average amount of money a Senator receives in contributions during an election cycle is about five million dollars.&#160; (The details are available at OpenSecrets.org.)&#160; This cost for a Senate seat is five times the cost of a Representative seat.&#160; There are several reasons Senators are more expensive than Representatives.</p> 
<p>Congress consists of 435 Representatives and 100 Senators.&#160; There are more than four times as many Representatives as Senators, so one Senator can be thought of as having more than four times as much power as one Representative.&#160; For this reason it makes sense that a Senator would receive at least four times as much money as a Representative.</p> 
<p>Another reason Senators are more expensive than Representatives is that Senators have powers that Representatives don't have.&#160; Specifically Senators vote on treaties with foreign countries and participate in choosing ambassadors to foreign countries, judges for the U.S. Supreme Court, and some other officials.&#160; Choosing judges for the Supreme Court is especially important politically.&#160; These extra powers are worth extra money for organizations that buy influence.</p> 
<p>Yet another reason Senators are more expensive than Representatives is that it is unusual for someone to become a Senator without first serving as a U.S. Representative or state Governor.&#160; Therefore, <b>Senators have already repeatedly demonstrated a willingness to be a puppet, er..., to go along with many of the desires of campaign contributors</b>.&#160; That willingness attracts extra financial support.</p> 
<h1>Why Committee Chairmen Are The Most Expensive</h1> 
<p>Let's suppose that Clif has noble goals and intends to keep his promise of voting for laws that are in the best interests of a majority of voters, and voting against proposed laws that would not be in their best interests.&#160; Can he keep his promise?&#160; Unfortunately, no.&#160; Virtually every vote in Congress, whether it is in favor or against a proposed law, involves compromises.</p> 
<p>The proposed laws &#8212; which are called bills &#8212; that U.S. Representatives and Senators get to vote on are created in Congressional committees.&#160; These committees virtually always put into the bills some features that are favored by the organizations who contribute large campaign contributions.&#160; Sometimes campaign contributors have so much influence that a bill appears to have been written by these contributors.</p> 
<p>The result is that every bill contains some features that benefit many voters and some features that benefit campaign contributors.&#160; This combination makes it impossible for a Senator or Representative to always vote against bills that contain laws that most voters disapprove of, and only vote in favor of bills that only contain what most voters would approve of.&#160; This concept is so important it's worth repeating.&#160; The bills from Congressional committees always contain what most voters would consider to be both good and bad features, so it is impossible to vote in ways that only support good laws and never support what most voters would regard as bad laws.</p> 
<p>As you can see, <b>the power of Congress is in the hands of Congressional committees where the bills are written</b>.&#160; Campaign contributors know this, so they funnel more of their campaign contributions to Congressmen who have the most influence in the most important committees.</p> 
<p>Big campaign contributors also channel more money to members of the committees that write laws having the most influence on the contributor's kind of business.&#160; For example, agribusiness corporations give more money to Representatives who are members of the House Agriculture committee and to Senators who are members of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry committee.&#160; Similarly, banks and credit unions give more money to members of the House Financial Services committee and the Senate Finance committee.&#160; Many kinds of corporations give money to members of the House Energy and Commerce committee and the Senate Commerce, Science, and Transportation committee because these powerful committees write laws that regulate many kinds of businesses.&#160; Clearly the amount of money given to each Congressman is heavily dependent on which committees he or she is on.</p> 
<p>Each committee is headed by a chairman.&#160; These <b>committee chairmen have tremendous amounts of control over the bills written in that committee</b>.&#160; As a result, committee chairmen receive much more money in campaign contributions compared to other members of the same committee, and especially compared to average Congressmen.&#160; How much more?&#160; In the 2004 election cycle the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce committee, Representative Joe Barton, received about four times as much money as each of the other members on the same committee (excluding the second-ranked member).&#160; In specific numbers, just counting the money received from Barton's top five industry categories (as reported at the OpenSecrets.org website), Barton received &#36;896,775 &#8212; close to one million dollars.</p> 
<p>The influence of campaign contributions occurs most significantly in committees.&#160; By comparison, the voting that takes place in the Senate chamber and the chamber of the House of Representatives basically just blocks the most offensive and unpopular bills.&#160; The other bills, which contain a combination of benefits for both voters and campaign contributors, get passed and, if they are signed by the President, become laws.</p> 
<h1>Where Does The Money Go?&#160; Advertising!</h1> 
<p>Why is it so important for politicians to raise so much money?&#160; The most expensive aspect of a political campaign is advertising.&#160; The purpose of this advertising is to convince voters to vote for a specific candidate.&#160; Does advertising work?&#160; Definitely! Paid political advertisements are especially effective when they are designed by knowledgeable media consultants.</p> 
<p><b>Advertising is especially influential in primary elections</b>.&#160; Consider that in a general election relatively few people are undecided about choosing between a Republican candidate and a Democratic candidate.&#160; But in a primary election a Republican voter can more easily be persuaded to switch allegiance from one Republican candidate to another Republican candidate.&#160; Similarly, a Democratic voter can more easily be persuaded to switch allegiance from one Democratic candidate to another Democratic candidate.&#160; In other words, voters are less biased and more vulnerable to the influence of political advertisements when their choices are all from their preferred political party.</p> 
<p>An interesting example of advertising influencing a primary election occurred when a Democratic governor in California was running for reelection.&#160; As usually occurs for incumbents, he had no real competition in the Democratic primary.&#160; His biggest concern was the possibility of competing against a strong Republican candidate in the general election.&#160; To prevent this situation the Governor's campaign team paid for political advertisements that criticized the strongest candidates in the Republican primary.&#160; The result was that a weaker candidate won the Republican primary, and this made it easier for the Governor to win the general election.&#160; This example demonstrates that advertising strategies can be complex.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately for voters, <b>advertising intentionally avoids revealing a candidate's position on the issues that voters care about the most</b>.&#160; Political advertisements in favor of a candidate usually focus on conveying generalized positive characteristics such as leadership, decisiveness, popularity, and effectiveness.&#160; Expressing the candidate's position on a controversial issue is avoided because that tends to alienate more voters than it attracts.&#160; The most effective political advertisements focus on criticizing opposing candidates in terms of character flaws and past voting records, both of which are easy to distort.&#160; Why is negative advertising so effective?&#160; Because there is a basic human tendency for people to be slow and cautious about increasing their regard for someone based on positive information, whereas people are quick to lose their regard for someone based on negative information.</p> 
<p>On a small scale, political advertising takes the form of lawn signs, billboards, newspaper advertisements, and printed material delivered by mail.&#160; This kind of advertising is especially appropriate for politicians running for a local office, such as a seat on the city council or the job of county Sheriff.&#160; Politicians who run for Governor, U.S. Senator, or U.S. President must reach many more voters, so they heavily depend on television advertising.</p> 
<p>Television advertisements are especially effective because people react more strongly to visual images than to words, either spoken or printed.&#160; Unfortunately for candidates, television advertising is tremendously expensive.&#160; In fact, most of the money raised for Congressional and Presidential elections is used to pay for television advertising.</p> 
<p>Another form of advertising occurs as a result of politicians holding rallies.&#160; Although part of the purpose of a rally is to increase the enthusiasm of supporters, <b>the more important purpose of a public rally is to get free media attention</b>.&#160; In other words, money is used to promote the rally and make it look impressive so that television and newspaper reporters will report on the rally as a news event.&#160; Although the news coverage is free, lots of money has to be spent to get that free coverage.</p> 
<p>Some people complain that third-party candidates don't receive adequate television news and newspaper attention.&#160; For example, in the year 2000 Presidential election, news media had relatively few reports about third-party candidate Ralph Nader.&#160; One of the reasons for this neglect is that third-party candidates don't spend much money buying time for television advertisements and space for newspaper advertisements.&#160; Naturally television networks and newspaper businesses prefer to give free advertising &#8212; in the form of news coverage &#8212; to Republican and Democratic candidates because these are the candidates who buy the most advertising.</p> 
<p>The cost of paid political advertisements is often the biggest expense in an election campaign.&#160; This expense can't be avoided because political advertisements are so effective.&#160; To put it bluntly, a politician who runs for an important office such as Governor, Congressman, or President cannot win without lots of paid political advertisements, especially on television.</p> 
<h1>Biased News</h1> 
<p>Can money be used to bias the news?&#160; Yes.</p> 
<p>The most direct approach for influencing news media is for corporations and wealthy individuals to buy television stations or networks, radio stations or networks, newspapers, and magazines.&#160; This approach allows the media owners to bias the news in whatever way they wish.</p> 
<p>As examples of media ownership, <b>the ABC television network is owned by Disney Corporation, NBC television is owned by General Electric Corporation, and CBS is owned by Viacom</b>.&#160; How does this ownership bias the news?&#160; ABC news reporters never produce investigative reports about the Disney Corporation, NBC news reporters would never say anything negative about General Electric, and CBS news reporters would never be critical of activities by Viacom's other businesses, which include Blockbuster and Paramount Pictures.&#160; In addition, each television network also avoids saying anything negative about the parent corporation of another network.&#160; Why?&#160; So the corporate owner of a competing network won't use the same tactic to get revenge.</p> 
<p>Some news media are owned by people who strongly favor one political party or the other, and it's normal for the owners to use their political influence.&#160; Here is an example.&#160; A few weeks before a major election, <i>The Oregonian</i> newspaper in Oregon received statements from several women claiming that a married U.S. Senator from Oregon, Bob Packwood, had sexual relations with them when they were under the influence of alcohol.&#160; The newspaper owners favored the Republican party and the Senator was a Republican, so the newspaper delayed publishing an article on the subject until the day after the Senator was reelected.&#160; Although accusations do not by themselves imply guilt, the accusations in this case were well-founded, the Senator was disgraced, and at the end of his six-year term he chose not to run for reelection.</p> 
<p>As this example shows, <b>a favorite tactic for biasing news sources is to adjust the timing of a news story</b>.&#160; This tactic includes reporting a story on the same day that lots of other newsworthy events occur so that the story fails to appear on the front page of a newspaper.</p> 
<p>A more obvious tactic for biasing the news is to fail to report a story at all.&#160; Surprisingly this happens for even some important news.&#160; To call attention to this tactic and call attention to under-reported stories, a professor and students at Sonoma State University in California created Project Censored which each year announces what they regard as the 25 most under-reported stories of the year.&#160; Since then, other groups and individuals have created their own versions of under-reported stories.&#160; Of course the choice of stories tends to reflect the political bias of the people choosing the stories.</p> 
<p>Some people claim that there is competition in the news-media business and this competition ensures that news media remains unbiased.&#160; If this perspective were correct, there would be diversity in who owns various television and radio stations.&#160; However, five years after antitrust regulations removed restrictions about the ownership of radio stations, two companies owned 1,400 radio stations, whereas previously these stations had been owned by 115 companies.&#160; The resulting <b>absence of diversity in the ownership of news sources results in less competition and greater control over what citizens hear about current events</b>.</p> 
<p>Part of the reason for the lack of diversity in news-media ownership is that radio stations, newspapers, and book-publishing businesses are not very profitable.&#160; This minimal profitability is passed on to employees working in these businesses.&#160; The appeal of getting to talk on the radio, pursuing breaking news, and being surrounded by books is what attracts employees to media businesses in spite of the relatively low income.&#160; In a similar way, <b>wealthy individuals and corporations often choose to buy radio stations, newspapers, and book-publishing businesses for reasons of influencing citizens and consumers rather than for being profitable investments.</b></p> 

<p>Most of the funding for television, radio, and newspaper news comes from paid advertisements.&#160; Therefore news editors try to avoid presenting news in ways that would have a negative impact on the businesses that heavily advertise in that media.&#160; As a result there is a slight news bias in favor of whichever businesses provide the most advertising income.&#160; Examples of this influence include newspapers avoiding stories that seriously criticize grocery stores, radio stations avoiding scandalous stories about automobile dealers, and television stations avoiding stories that negatively reflect on automobile manufacturers.</p> 
<p>Even when there is no financial relationship between media and a business, influences still occur.&#160; Consider the pharmaceutical industry.&#160; Pharmaceutical corporations often provide funding for non-profit research organizations to do research regarding medications that are manufactured by these corporations.&#160; Typically the people in the research organizations are at least slightly biased in favor of the usefulness of the medications.&#160; Even if they aren't, the corporation usually chooses which other drugs to use in the comparison, and perhaps the dosage amounts.&#160; If the preliminary research results are not favorable, the corporation abandons the study.&#160; When the research results are favorable, the organization creates a press release for the news media and the result becomes a news story.&#160; The consequence is that <b>the effectiveness or safety of a product or technology is essentially promoted through a news story</b>.&#160; The biased information receives extra credibility because viewers, listeners, and readers trust news stories far more than paid advertisements.&#160; Notice that with this approach <b>the news reporting is not biased, yet the news is biased</b>.</p> 
<p>A related approach is to provide funding for think tanks.&#160; The stated goal of a think tank is to provide an environment in which clear, independent thinking can be done about a particular subject.&#160; However, think tanks are usually supported by funds from sources that have a specific political agenda.&#160; For example, coal and oil companies and automobile manufacturers fund think tanks that &#8212; surprise! &#8212; produce supposedly scientific studies that claim that increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere do not cause global warming.&#160; What makes the studies sound less biased is that the <b>think tanks are often given misleading names</b>, such as the Greening Earth Society in the case of a think tank funded by the coal, oil, and auto industry.</p> 
<p>Another variation of this general approach is for an industry or large corporation to provide financial support for a citizens group that favors a particular government decision.&#160; The hypothetical organization named Citizens for Superior Foods that was introduced earlier in this chapter is an example of this kind of organization.&#160; Such an organization pretends &#8212; especially in its name &#8212; to be a grassroots organization, which means it is supposedly citizen-supported.</p> 
<p>A well-known example of a citizens group is the National Rifle Association, which is better known as the NRA.&#160; This organization is heavily funded by businesses that manufacture and sell firearms.&#160; However, the NRA portrays itself in terms of its members who are gun and rifle owners.&#160; These non-business members do contribute money to the NRA, but in amounts that pale in comparison to contributions from members who are also owners or employees of firearms-based businesses.&#160; Collaborations between average citizens and businesses, such as the NRA, are not illegal or even unethical or unfair.&#160; However, <b>the funding sources are seldom mentioned by the media when the organization is mentioned</b>.&#160; The result is that when a business-supported citizens group favors a political issue, the popularity of the issue is distorted by the extra funding.</p> 
<p>News editors have learned various techniques for subtly biasing viewers and readers.&#160; In defense, politicians have learned how to avoid being a victim of the techniques.&#160; For example, politicians no longer bend down to shake hands with a child because photographs looking down at a candidate make the candidate seem weaker.&#160; As another example, <b>successful politicians learn to speak in entertaining sound bites, and avoid long sentences that could be taken out of context, because concise statements are the ones that make it into the news</b>.</p> 
<p>The ways in which news media can influence voters are endless.&#160; Also they are extremely effective because <b>viewers and readers forget that broadcast and published news can be true and yet also biased</b>.</p> 
<h1>Do Campaign Contributions Really Change Politician's Decisions?</h1> 
<p>It is rare for a politician to be elected to a high-level office without first passing through lower-level offices.&#160; By the time a politician rises through the ranks from city councilor to city Mayor to state representative to U.S. Representative to the Chairman of a powerful Congressional committee, and becomes a Senator or even a President, campaign contributors have carefully monitored the politician's biases and agendas.&#160; Based on this information, major campaign contributors focus their contributions on politicians who share their agendas, or on politicians who at least are receptive to their agendas.&#160; In contrast, politicians who are not receptive to the agendas of at least some big campaign contributors cannot reach high-level offices.&#160; Clearly <b>the politicians who get elected are the ones whose voting record the biggest campaign contributors like</b>.</p> 
<p>As a result of this selection process <b>many Congressmen and Presidents can honestly claim they are not changing their mind about political matters based on campaign contributions</b>.&#160; Their opinions were established many years earlier.&#160; They are rewarded for these opinions.</p> 
<h1>&#8220;Thanks For The Money, But I'm Not Changing My Decision&#8221;</h1> 
<p>Let's get back to following Clif Clifford.&#160; Suppose he wins the seat in the U.S. House of Representatives, and Lester Seedum visits him.&#160; If Clif says, &#8220;Thanks for the money, but I think consumers should be allowed to know whether they are buying genetically modified food, so I won't vote for the exclusion you want,&#8221; what would happen?</p> 
<p>For one thing, Lester would ask other members of the House of Representatives &#8212; who Lester has also given money to &#8212; not to invite Clif to become a member of any key committee.&#160; <b>Without participation in key committees, a Congressman can only vote yes or no on important bills that already have been heavily influenced by the people on the committees</b>.&#160; This filtering ensures that powerful committee members are fully infected with cashus influentious.</p> 
<p><b>Another consequence of a politician thumbing their nose at a lobbyist is that the organizations behind the lobbyist won't contribute as much money to the politician's reelection campaign</b>.&#160; In the meantime, a Representative in Congress cannot accomplish much during only two years in office &#8212; especially when they have no influence in important committees.&#160; Joining a committee, not to mention rising to power within the committee, requires many years of being reelected.&#160; In other words, independent thinking leads to political suicide.</p> 
<p>If an issue is a significant part of the agenda of the politician's political party, there is another consequence of betrayal.&#160; Party leaders will learn of the party betrayal through Congressional voting records or reports to the party by the betrayed lobbyist.&#160; There are even Congressional members who are, appropriately, named Whips whose job it is to make sure that Congressmen in their political party vote in the ways the party wants them to vote.&#160; For the remainder of the politician's term, the Whip and other Congressmen are likely to use peer pressure to get the politician to conform to the party's agenda &#8212; as determined by party leaders, who are under the influence of campaign contributions.</p> 
<p>The final consequence of not cooperating with a lobbyist or party leader occurs at the next election.&#160; The lobbyist is likely to give financial support to the politician's opponents &#8212; in both the primary and general elections.&#160; If the politician votes against party leaders, the party leaders will choose not to give money to reelect that politician, and they will give financial support to a more party-minded candidate in the primary election.&#160; <b>Party funds are such a big share of funding that the loss of party funds commonly leads to losing the next election</b>.</p> 
<p>Suppose that somehow voters were able to get a pro-voter politician into a position of power, such as becoming chairman of an important committee, so that the politician could write a bill that would accomplish what most voters would like.&#160; <b>Such a bill would be defeated by the majority of Congressmen who are under the influence of campaign contributors</b>.</p> 
<p>Even a U.S. President cannot succeed in passing legislation that a majority of voters want if it conflicts with the desires of the biggest campaign contributors.&#160; Such legislation would be blocked by Congressmen responding to the wishes of rich special interests.</p> 
<p>As an example of such an effort, President Bill Clinton attempted to implement a reform of health-care laws that was favored by a majority of voters.&#160; The financial influence of health insurance companies, doctors represented by the American Medical Association, pharmaceutical companies, and other health-related professionals and businesses, succeeded in convincing members of Congress to water down the laws in ways that were acceptable to the health-care industry.&#160; The result did not accomplish as much as the President and voters had hoped for.&#160; In particular, there continue to be many people who can't obtain health insurance, even when they are willing to pay higher insurance premiums.&#160; Alas, bold desires for reform typically dwindle to nothing.&#160; (Update: A recently passed law is reforming health insurance, but in ways that force healthy individuals to pay extra money that covers the unhealthy individuals who previously could not get insurance.)</p> 
<p>Most politicians in Congress become infected with cashus influentious long before they even run for election to Congress.&#160; At best, <b>un</b>infected politicians keep a low profile and look for opportunities to champion one or two carefully chosen, voter-supported causes.</p> 
<h1>More Ethical Politicians Would Be Nice, But Not Sufficient</h1> 
<p>Voters are often inspired when a politician seems to have the voter's best interests at heart, and then later the voters are disillusioned when the politician is found to have lied, been involved in a sexual scandal, or been involved in corruption.&#160; Unfortunately this desire for a high standard of ethics in politicians conflicts with the motivations of a politician.</p> 
<p>What motivates a politician?&#160; The primary goal of a politician is to get elected.&#160; A politician does have other goals &#8212; some of which may be noble and some of which may be selfish &#8212; but those other goals are not as important as getting elected.&#160; The reason this goal is so important is that lots of sacrifices have to be made to get elected.</p> 
<p>The few people who are willing to make the sacrifices are the people who, for whatever reason, have an incredibly strong desire to get elected.</p> 
<p>In order to get elected, a politician has two secondary goals.&#160; One of the secondary goals is to get voters to believe he or she is trying to solve the problems the voters want solved.&#160; The other secondary goal is to avoid offending his or her campaign contributors.&#160; The fact that voters and campaign contributors typically have conflicting agendas leads to the tendency of a politician to lie to both voters and campaign contributors.&#160; <b>The only way to avoid lying to both voters and campaign contributors is to avoid making any statements about the politician's actual priorities</b>.&#160; Giving speeches without saying much about political priorities is a necessary skill for every successful politician.</p> 
<p>Notice that behaving ethically is not a top motivation for most politicians.&#160; In fact, the requirement that a politician must lie to voters and campaign contributors tends to discourage ethical people from becoming politicians.&#160; As a result, <b>increased ethical behavior by politicians won't happen until lying is no longer required for getting elected</b>.</p> 
<p>Although corruption in government continues, the good news is that corruption isn't as bad as it used to be.&#160; Corruption in cities such as New York City, Chicago, St.&#160; Louis, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia has diminished.&#160; Police officers no longer routinely receive payoffs from illegal gambling establishments to leave them alone, on election day ballot boxes are no longer filled with lots of illegal votes, and government contracts are much less often given to the businesses of friends and relatives.</p> 
<p>The bad news is that, although it has diminished, <b>corruption is now more subtle, less blatant, and frequently even legal</b>.&#160; And it usually involves campaign contributions.&#160; For example, instead of police officers receiving payoffs from illegal gambling establishments, large campaign contributions have created legal versions of gambling in the form of state lotteries and casinos on Indian reservations.&#160; Instead of ballot boxes getting stuffed with illegal votes, shortened voter-registration lists in pivotal Florida districts affected the outcome of the 2000 Presidential election.&#160; Instead of government contracts being given to friends and relatives, big government contracts in Iraq were awarded &#8212; in secret without competitive bidding &#8212; to Halliburton, which the Vice President, Dick Cheney, had previously headed as the Chief Executive Officer.</p> 
<p>The desire for politicians to be ethical is based on the belief that ethical politicians would resist the influence of campaign contributions.&#160; Unfortunately the reality is that current voting methods are so vulnerable to being influenced through money that even the most ethical individual would find it difficult to get elected without the assistance of lobbyists and the money they control.</p> 
<h1>Political-Party Leaders Choose The Puppets, Er, Candidates</h1> 
<p>Who chooses the candidates who appear on the primary ballot?&#160; To a large extent <b>each political party chooses its candidates in backroom meetings</b>.&#160; In these meetings the leaders of a political party decide how much of the party's money is given to support each candidate.&#160; The Republican and Democratic parties each control many millions of dollars, so party leaders have lots of influence in election results.</p> 
<p>It might seem that any candidate in a political party who can attract enough votes would deserve funding from the political party.&#160; But if a candidate who is popular with the voters does not share most of the political agendas of the party leaders, that candidate is likely to receive much less financial support in the primary election.&#160; <b>Political-party leaders prefer puppets, not independent thinkers</b>, and especially not rebels.</p> 
<p>The situation shifts a bit if a somewhat rebellious or independent-thinking popular candidate demonstrates an ability to win lots of votes in multiple elections and raise unusually large amounts of money.&#160; Such an outsider can influence the political party's agenda because political-party leaders listen to any politician in their party who is backed by lots of money.&#160; In fact, this is what ultimately steers the agenda of the Republican and Democratic parties.&#160; If a politician continues to raise unusually large amounts of money and continually wins elections, that politician eventually becomes a political-party leader and gets invited to participate in the backroom meetings where the real influence occurs.&#160; However, this shift seldom occurs because independent-thinking politicians seldom appeal to politically involved organizations and businesses that have lots of money.</p> 
<p>The bias in favor of puppet politicians is so important that <b>politicians who would be very popular among voters often choose not to enter a primary election if they know they will receive relatively little financial support from their party</b>.&#160; As a result, <b>politicians who the voters would really like don't even appear on a ballot</b>.&#160; That's right.&#160; Democracy loses, money wins.&#160; And it happens even before citizens get a chance to vote.</p> 
<p>Imagine the kind of candidate the voters &#8212; of either political party &#8212; would like to see on the ballot.&#160; Voters want a politician who recognizes how to solve political problems and is willing to implement those solutions.&#160; The ideal candidate also would be trustworthy and ethical.&#160; Does such a candidate ever appear on the ballot?&#160; Of course not.&#160; Now you know why.</p> 
<h1>Gaps In Agendas And Platforms</h1> 
<p>What are the agendas of the political-party leaders?&#160; A naive voter would assume that their agendas match the officially supported party platform, which is the official statement of the party's political agenda.</p> 
<p>In reality, the party platform is a list of voter-preferred actions that the financial backers of the party are willing to accept.&#160; Political-party leaders have agendas that are usually related to maintaining or increasing the profits of businesses that are owned or operated by the people who give big donations to political parties.&#160; These money-backed agendas are balanced against the most popular desires of the voters in the party.</p> 
<p>The result of this balance is that a party platform uses general statements that the voters in that party feel are representative of their political desires.&#160; At the same time, <b>the platform statements are general enough that party leaders can achieve their special-interest-backed political agendas without noticeably compromising the popular interpretation of these statements</b>.</p> 
<h1>Where Does Money Make The Most Difference?</h1> 
<p>Why are the results of elections so easy to manipulate through campaign contributions?&#160; It's because primary elections currently use plurality voting and, as will be explained (in Chapter 5), plurality voting is vulnerable to manipulation by money.&#160; In the future, when voters can finally mark not only their first choice, but also their second choice, third choice, and so on, primary elections can finally yield fair results.</p> 
<p>There are no other alternatives.&#160; Setting limits on campaign contributions hasn't worked, and you will later learn why it is easy to bypass any new campaign-contribution limits.</p> 
<p>When elections finally use fair voting methods, the excessive influence of money in politics will end.&#160; Money will still have some influence in politics, but it won't be as excessive as it is now.&#160; Finally voters will be able to elect politicians who are motivated by the desires of a majority of voters, not by the desires of the biggest campaign contributors.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; At the OpenSecrets.org website, look at the financial and committee-membership information about the two Senators from your state and the U.S. Representative from your district.&#160; Does this information match what you expected?</p> 
<p>When you watch, listen to, or read the news, consider how the flow of money to or from businesses might be affected by the news story.&#160; Also consider how the story might be biased without altering the truthfulness of the information.&#160; When there is a news story about a political event, consider how much money was spent to get the free news coverage.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 2:&#160; Good Buy:&#160; What Does the Money Buy?</h1> 
<p>In this chapter let's follow the trail of money in politics back to its source to find out who the biggest contributors are and what they get in return for their contributions.</p> 
<h1>Drifting Political Parties</h1> 
<p>Where do campaign contributions come from?&#160; Let's look at some examples.&#160; In each of these examples notice that the Republican and Democratic parties, and the politicians who are under the control of the parties, struggle to find a balance between what the voters want and what the campaign contributors want.</p> 
<p>The grassroots organization called Mothers Against Drunk Drivers &#8212; or MADD &#8212; was started in 1980 by a mother whose 13-year-old daughter was killed by a repeat-offender drunk driver.&#160; MADD focused attention on the seriousness of drunk driving at a time when politicians didn't write tough laws against drunk driving.&#160; This lack of tough laws resulted in many drivers being convicted of drunk driving yet still being allowed to drive.&#160; Why weren't politicians already doing what many people wanted, namely to reduce the number of people injured and killed by drunk drivers?&#160; Because the manufacturers and distributors of alcoholic beverages contributed tremendous amounts of money to Republican and Democratic politicians to prevent such laws from being written.&#160; These alcoholic-beverage businesses wanted to protect their profits.&#160; The tremendous growth of MADD forced politicians of both political parties to realize that a clear majority of voters wanted tougher laws against drunk driving.&#160; Only then did politicians, with approval from the Republican and Democratic parties, create stricter drunk-driving laws.</p> 
<p>Have stricter drunk-driving laws reduced the number of people killed each year by drunk drivers?&#160; Yes, dramatically.&#160; In the year 1980 there were 28,000 such deaths.&#160; Twenty years later &#8212; in 2000 &#8212; there were 16,068 such deaths.&#160; (For the mathematically inclined this is a decrease of 43 percent.)&#160; This decrease is even more impressive when you consider that the decrease occurred in spite of a big increase in the number of people driving.&#160; Of course the tougher laws also led to a decline in the profits of the manufacturers and distributors of alcoholic beverages.</p> 
<p>This shift in priorities illustrates what democracy is supposed to be about: providing the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people.&#160; In this case the dramatic reduction in deaths and injuries was exchanged for a loss of profits that affects relatively few people in relatively mild ways.</p> 
<p>Here is another example of the conflict between voters and campaign contributors.&#160; For decades a majority of voters have disliked the fact that each year the government gave millions of dollars to support the growing of tobacco and to administer the tobacco industry's price-support program &#8212; even though tobacco has virtually no beneficial properties and the use of it typically leads to health problems.&#160; The millions of dollars given to politicians by the tobacco industry provided motivation that was stronger than the desires of voters.</p> 
<p>A grassroots effort that began by banning smoking in public places eventually made it clear to politicians how most citizens felt about smoking.&#160; After that, anti-smoking groups called attention to the large amounts of money given by the tobacco industry to both Republicans and Democrats.&#160; Finally, the politicians in Congress passed laws that reduced the tax benefits previously given to the tobacco industry.</p> 
<p>A related development occurred at the end of the previous millennium.&#160; Tobacco companies were successfully sued for hiding the health hazards of tobacco products.&#160; The defeat of once-powerful tobacco corporations is perhaps best symbolized by Philip Morris Company changing its name to Altria Group so that it and its subsidiary corporation &#8212; Kraft Foods, which it bought using the profits from its tobacco products &#8212; would not suffer from the widespread bias against its former name.&#160; The tobacco industry still contributes lots of money to politicians and still receives relatively favorable treatment, but now the anti-tobacco sentiment of most voters has an increased influence on political decisions.</p> 
<p>Now let's look at an example in the financial industry.&#160; In 1980, under the influence of large campaign contributions, Congress changed the laws that govern savings-and-loan institutions.&#160; The new laws allowed these businesses to engage in financially irresponsible activities.&#160; Most notable was the change that allowed the owner of a savings-and-loan institution to loan money to himself.&#160; The new laws resulted in many loans being made for highly speculative investments.&#160; To make matters worse, the loans were made without adequate collateral (property that could be seized and sold if the loan was not repaid).&#160; Citizens who were aware of this change warned against it, but politicians allowed it.</p> 
<p>Within a few years of the 1980 changes, a number of savings-and-loan institutions began going bankrupt.&#160; The now-infamous Charles Keating was the owner of California-based Lincoln Savings and Loan, which was one of the failing savings-and-loan businesses.&#160; Keating had contributed lots of money to the election campaigns of both U.S. Senators from his home state of Arizona and a Senator from California.&#160; Largely because of this support Keating was able to convince these three Senators (plus two others) to participate in meetings with federal bank regulators who were investigating Lincoln Savings and Loan.&#160; The influence of the U.S. Senators helped the federal regulators choose not to shut down Lincoln Savings and Loan at that time.</p> 
<p>The topic of the savings-and-loan bankruptcies was avoided during the 1988 election in spite of the fact that the problem had grown out of control.&#160; After the 1988 election, Congress finally began dealing with the problem.&#160; Some savings-and-loan owners eventually went to jail for their illegal activities.&#160; However, their prison sentences were about one-fifth the sentence of an average bank robber.&#160; Not surprisingly some politically well-connected savings-and-loan owners, including the son of a U.S. President, never went to jail in spite of clear evidence of their crimes.</p> 
<p>Most of the money that had been removed from the bankrupt savings-and-loan businesses could not be recovered, so the federal government used government funds to repay depositors up to the government-guaranteed amount, which Congress had recently more than doubled.</p> 
<p>This savings-and-loan bailout shifted the losses to citizens in the form of taxes.&#160; By the time the bailout is paid off, it will have cost taxpayers more than 200 billion dollars!&#160; That's equivalent to each household paying an extra two thousand dollars (&#36;2,000) in taxes.&#160; This tax burden is unfair because it covers losses caused by reckless spending that the voters didn't want to allow in the first place.</p> 
<p>Microsoft is a corporation that, for many years, didn't get involved in politics and didn't contribute to election campaigns.&#160; As a result, Microsoft lost the early antitrust cases that were brought against it, and Microsoft was in jeopardy of being split up.&#160; At the end of the next Presidential election Microsoft was a major contributor toward the cost of President George W.&#160; Bush's inaugural festivities.&#160; Soon after that the Microsoft antitrust suit was resolved in such a way that Microsoft had to make only minor concessions.&#160; Of course the judges involved in such cases are not elected, but judges can be influenced by the politicians who write the laws that judges interpret.&#160; Although Microsoft's campaign contributions were late, they allowed Microsoft to retain its monopolistic position and thereby preserve its high profit margin &#8212; at the expense of millions of customers.</p> 
<p>So far the examples presented here are somewhat well-known.&#160; But there are many lesser-known areas in which large corporations and wealthy individuals have gained increased profits in ways that most voters would not approve if they knew about them.&#160; The maritime industry, which deals with making, maintaining, and running ocean-going ships, gives millions of dollars to Congressional candidates.&#160; What does the maritime industry get in return?&#160; Congress continues to give enormous federal subsidies to commercial ship owners who agree to make their vessels available to the government during wartime.&#160; This arrangement made sense when it was created, but many organizations &#8212; and even the Pentagon &#8212; agree that the program &#8220;no longer serves a useful purpose.&#8221;</p> 
<p>These examples show that money is typically at the root of the large gap between what voters want and politicians do.</p> 
<h1>Pencil Metaphor</h1> 
<p>Lots of attention is given to the gap between Republicans and Democrats.&#160; Yet the gap between voters and campaign contributors is much larger.&#160; To appreciate the nature of these two gaps, let's consider a metaphor.</p> 
<p>Imagine looking at a pencil.&#160; Suppose we think of the political position of the Democratic party as being near the left end of the pencil, and the political position of the Republican party as being near the right end of the pencil.</p> 
<p>When most people talk about politics they refer to voters as if they were represented by a position somewhere along the pencil.&#160; Specifically a liberal is thought of as being on the left side, a conservative is on the right side, a radical liberal is at the extreme left end, a right-wing conservative is at the extreme right end, and a moderate citizen is assumed to be at the center.&#160; (This dimension is called the <i>political spectrum</i>.)&#160; The question naturally arises: &#8220;Where are the majority of voters?&#8221;</p> 
<p>The answer is that the majority of voters are about one foot above the pencil!</p> 
<p>At this point it's natural to wonder: &#8220;If most voters are really above the pencil, why don't politicians and political parties move closer to the voters to increase the number of votes?&#8221; The answer is that one foot below the pencil are the people who fund election campaigns.</p> 
<p>This pencil metaphor clarifies why there is a large gap between politicians and voters.&#160; Politicians claim they will solve problems in ways that voters want, yet they also go along with the desires of the people who fund their election campaigns.&#160; They can't do both, so they end up trying to find a balance between voters and the biggest campaign contributors.</p> 
<p>What happens when a politician strays from the Republican or Democratic party agenda for the purpose of winning more votes?&#160; The biggest campaign contributors ask the party leaders to reduce the funds going to the straying candidate &#8212; and increase the funding of an alternate candidate who is more willing to follow the party's agenda.&#160; Yes, political parties can and do dump politicians in their own party when party leaders &#8212; who have close connections with the party's biggest campaign contributors &#8212; perceive these politicians to be too uncooperative or independent.</p> 
<p>The pencil metaphor illustrates that the traditional one-dimensional view of politics &#8212; where a person's political views can be represented by a single point along a dimension from conservative to liberal &#8212; is simplistic and unrealistic.&#160; It also distracts from the bigger gap between voters and campaign contributors.&#160; Of course campaign contributors like this distraction.&#160; One-dimensional labeling also distracts voters from talking about specific issues in concrete terms, which is a much more meaningful way to characterize a person's political views.</p> 

<h1>Goals Of Moneyed Interests</h1> 
<p>What do campaign contributors want, and typically get, in exchange for their campaign contributions?&#160; To begin, let's look at where the biggest campaign contributions come from.</p> 
<p>Professional individuals who donate large amounts of money to election campaigns include lawyers, doctors, dentists, optometrists, realtors, teachers, auto dealers, certified public accountants, postal workers, and brokers.&#160; Corporations, especially the big ones like Wal-Mart, General Electric, Exxon-Mobil, and Boeing contribute millions of dollars.&#160; Labor unions also are big contributors.</p> 
<p>Especially big contributions come from corporations whose actions are regulated by government decisions.&#160; These corporations include banks, military defense contractors, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, oil companies, and telephone companies.&#160; Especially big contributions also come from corporations whose profits come from gambling, alcoholic beverages, and tobacco products.</p> 
<p>What do these contributors have in common?&#160; All of these contributors earn lots of money.&#160; In the case of professionals, the individuals are well-paid.&#160; In the case of corporations, the businesses they are in are highly profitable.&#160; In the case of trade unions, trade-union members do not earn as much as professionals, but trade-union members are required to contribute a portion of their salary to their union.&#160; The fact that these contributors have lots of money means that they can afford to make big contributions.</p> 
<p>In contrast, low-income wage earners &#8212; such as sales clerks, mechanics, writers, and family farmers &#8212; cannot afford to buy political influence.</p> 
<p>Another characteristic of the big campaign contributors is that most of them are involved in activities, practices, and ways of doing business that many citizens don't approve of.&#160; For example, pharmaceutical companies sell medications at prices that most people think are excessive, oil companies oppose improving automobile fuel efficiency, corporations involved with state lotteries and gambling casinos profit from gambling obsessions, defense contractors sell equipment to the U.S. military at high-profit prices, and alcoholic-beverage producers profit from alcoholics.&#160; Such businesses recognize there is widespread disapproval of what they do, so their contributions serve to protect their profits.</p> 
<p>Why are the profits of professionals and businesses so heavily affected by government decisions?&#160; Let us count the ways.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Taxes: To the extent that taxes can be reduced or even eliminated, profits increase.&#160; For example, individual campaign contributors want to reduce income taxes at the contributor's income level, and they may want to reduce sales taxes.&#160; Business owners want to reduce inventory taxes, employment taxes, and other taxes paid by their business.&#160; Corporations want to reduce their corporate taxes, and this strategy includes getting substantial tax credits for activities such as research and development (R&amp;D) and natural-resource development.</li> 
<li>Expenses: To the extent that government-required expenses can be reduced, profits increase.&#160; For example, business owners and corporations want to block increases in minimum wages and increases in employee benefits.&#160; They also want reduced costs for raw materials and energy, and limitations on lawsuit settlements.</li> 
<li>Legal monopoly: To the extent that a profession or a corporation can get laws passed that directly or indirectly establish a legal monopoly, their income increases.&#160; An historic example of a legal monopoly occurred in the 1940s when the inventor of FM (frequency-modulation) radio, Edwin Armstrong, was put out of business because David Sarnoff of RCA (Radio Corporation of America) was able to get a law passed that changed the frequency range for FM radio transmitters, and that suddenly made obsolete all the radio receivers sold by Armstrong.&#160; A recent example of a monopoly-related change occurred when the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), who was under the influence of media corporations, changed a law to allow a single business to own television stations in up to 45 percent of the country's metropolitan areas.&#160; In this case Congressmen received tens of thousands of phone calls within days of the decision, so Congress reversed this FCC ruling.</li> 
<li>Government Contracts and Subsidies: To the extent that a corporation can win government contracts or receive government subsidies, a corporation's income increases dramatically.&#160; For example, contracts for rebuilding Iraq's oil fields were given to Halliburton, which was formerly headed by Vice President Dick Cheney.&#160; Subsidies are commonly given to farming corporations.&#160; An indirect subsidy occurred when the government paid for the cleanup of Exxon's oil spill from the Valdez tanker in Alaska &#8212; for which Exxon has not yet paid anything.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>As you can see, campaign contributors have a lot to gain by influencing government decisions.&#160; The reduction in money going out &#8212; through reduced taxes and reduced expenses &#8212; and the increase in money coming in &#8212; indirectly through governmentally approved monopolies, and directly through government contracts and government subsidies &#8212; provide contributors with big profits.</p> 
<p>In most cases the increased profits easily outweigh the money spent on campaign contributions.&#160; For example, the energy industry in recent years has donated 65 million dollars in campaign contributions, and Congress considered legislation that would lead to an estimated 33 <b>billion</b> dollars in subsidies, tax breaks, and special loans and grants.&#160; That's equivalent to getting back about &#36;500 for each dollar donated!&#160; The amount that was finally approved was less, but it is still a very sweet deal.</p> 
<p>Is the heavy influence of corporate interests really a problem?&#160; Actually the bigger problem is that small businesses do not get the same advantages as large corporations.&#160; Small businesses don't have the inflated profits it takes to pay for influence in government decisions.&#160; This unfairness is significant, especially because small businesses offer significant advantages for happier consumers and a stronger economy.&#160; For example, chain restaurants cannot achieve the quality of cooking done at a small restaurant owned by a good cook.&#160; As another example, large corporations do not provide the conditions that foster the development of useful creative ideas, so many important inventions &#8212; including the personal computer and Internet web pages &#8212; have been invented by individuals and then later bought or copied by corporations.&#160; If small businesses received the kind of favoritism currently given to large corporations, small businesses could provide a stronger contribution to employment, productivity, efficiency, and especially creative development that corporations typically fail to achieve &#8212; in spite of their money-backed favored status.</p> 
<p>It is easy to fall into the trap of thinking that what voters want is the opposite of what corporations and moneyed interests want.&#160; That's very mistaken.&#160; It fails to consider that corporate desires are often appropriate.&#160; After all, the success of a corporation provides the job and salary that so many people want.&#160; Also remember that the people who run a corporation are also voters, so they certainly deserve an equal vote in elections.&#160; The people who run corporations are very intelligent people and many of them are very wise.&#160; Such intelligence and wisdom deserve extra attention in elections, and campaign contributions provide that extra influence.&#160; However many of the people who run corporations also tend to be greedy, which means they are willing to let other people suffer in order to get what they want.</p> 
<p>The pattern is clear.&#160; The biggest campaign contributions come from individuals and organizations whose profits are based on business activities and business priorities that many voters disapprove of or don't appreciate.&#160; Politicians, the Republican and Democratic parties, and the television and radio news media do not openly talk about this profit-protection agenda.&#160; Yet it quietly and dramatically influences election results in ways that most voters agree are excessive.</p> 
<h1>It's The Biggest Contributors</h1> 
<p>Not all campaign contributions come from people and businesses who oppose what most voters want.&#160; Major campaign contributions also come from wealthy people, average people, small businesses, large businesses, and nonprofit organizations who want what the majority of voters want.&#160; However, the total of these contributions is much less than the total contributions from people and businesses who oppose what the majority wants.</p> 
<p>What is the motivation for a wealthy individual who makes major contributions to politicians who favor what the majority of voters want?&#160; In some cases the wealthy contributor has other priorities in life besides making more money.&#160; In other cases the wealthy contributor may wisely realize that a healthy economy, a better community, and healthier and happier people increase the odds of having an economically healthy business or profitable returns on their investments.&#160; As an example, consider the stereotypic retired founder of a large corporation who donates lots of money to the local symphonic orchestra.&#160; The symphony tends to attract more professionals to the city, that makes it easier for the corporation to hire more-qualified professional employees, and that tends to increase the dividends on the stock owned by the retired founder.</p> 
<p>Although pro-voter contributions are numerous, the total amount of these contributions is much less than the total amount of the anti-voter contributions.&#160; As a result, <b>it is the biggest campaign contributors who oppose what most voters want</b>.&#160; Notice that the word <i>biggest</i> is an important part of this statement.&#160; By comparison, <b>the total contributions from people who want what most voters want are much smaller</b>.</p> 
<p>Labor unions are huge campaign contributors, but they don't necessarily fit into the category of the biggest campaign contributors.&#160; Why?&#160; The purpose of labor-union contributions is to offset the even larger contributions that are made by employers.</p> 
<p>At this point some clarifications about labor unions are needed.&#160; Back in the 1800s when labor unions developed, one of their purposes was to offset the bias that existed in courtrooms.&#160; At that time whenever there was a legal conflict between an employer and an employee, the outcome usually favored the employer.&#160; This bias occurred because elected government officials were almost always from the families of businessmen and seldom from the families of laborers.&#160; (At that time there was not much of a middle class.)&#160; Labor unions adopted the strategy of collecting union dues from laborers and contributing that money to politicians who opposed the influence of business owners.&#160; Additional political influence occurred through the use of violence and threats of violence.&#160; (Violence and threats also were used to convince laborers to join unions and pay union dues.)</p> 
<p>Labor unions were very successful.&#160; In fact, in a courtroom today, the outcome of a legal conflict between an employer and an employee is more likely to favor the employee rather than the employer.&#160; This result has also benefited employees in other industries that do not have labor unions.&#160; Also consider that part of the reason employees in high-tech, pharmaceutical, and other newer industries are paid good salaries and provided with good benefits is to prevent the employees from being tempted to form labor unions.</p> 
<p>Another consequence of the success of labor unions is that corporations in manufacturing industries now do most of their manufacturing in other countries where labor unions do not exist.&#160; This exporting of jobs enables a corporation to pay much smaller salaries and fewer benefits.&#160; To prevent labor unions from forming in those countries, corporations use campaign contributions to influence the politicians in those countries.&#160; Those campaign contributions are even more effective in less-developed countries where money is scarce.&#160; In some foreign countries U.S. corporations use bribery to influence government officials, and bribes are even more cost-effective than campaign contributions.</p> 
<p>Let's get back to considering other less-dominant campaign contributors.&#160; The goal of some contributors is to impose their religious and ethical priorities on other people.&#160; Of course examples of religious and ethical agendas include efforts to make abortion, homosexuality, and capital punishment illegal.&#160; In opposition, other campaign contributors want to allow individuals and states to make their own moral and ethical decisions.&#160; It's important to understand that the total amounts of these kinds of contributions are small compared to profit-protection contributions.</p> 
<h1>Which Special Interests Favor Which Parties?</h1> 
<p>Individual voters who are not wealthy tend to give money to either Republican candidates or Democratic candidates, but not both.&#160; This tendency naturally arises from the fact that Republican voters cannot vote in Democratic primaries, so they focus most of their attention on Republican candidates.&#160; Similarly Democratic voters cannot vote in Republican primaries, so they focus most of their attention on Democratic candidates.</p> 
<p>In contrast, the biggest campaign contributors pay attention to the candidates in both Republican and Democratic primary elections, and they often donate money to their preferred candidates in both parties.&#160; This strategy enables them to defeat the candidates they most dislike.&#160; In general elections, especially when the outcome is uncertain, the biggest contributors tend to donate money to both candidates.&#160; As a reminder, this strategy guarantees access to the winning candidate, regardless of which candidate wins.</p> 
<p>In spite of giving money to both Republican and Democratic candidates, some types of industries and organizations tend to prefer giving more money to the candidates of one political party compared to the other party.&#160; What are these preferences?</p> 
<p>Labor unions give considerably more money to Democratic candidates.&#160; Lawyers and the gambling industry also tend to give more money to Democratic candidates.</p> 
<p>As for the opposite bias, Republican candidates are favored by the oil and gas industries, railroad companies, the chemical and pharmaceutical industries, general contractors, the building-materials industry, the automotive industry, and the food, beverage (non-alcoholic), and food-processing industries.</p> 
<p>There are other party biases, but they are not as dramatic.&#160; For example, banks, insurance companies, and accountants give about 60 percent (somewhat more than half) of their campaign contributions to Republican candidates and about 40 percent (somewhat less than half) to Democratic candidates.</p> 
<p>Aside from these biases, most corporations and organizations give roughly equal amounts to both Republican and Democratic candidates.&#160; Examples of these unbiased sources of money include hospitals, nursing homes, and the real estate, telecommunications, telephone, and computer-equipment industries.</p> 
<h1>One State At A Time</h1> 
<p>Most voters focus attention on what goes on in Washington DC, yet campaign contributions often have the most impact at the state level.</p> 
<p>In the state of Oregon there was a petition on the ballot that would require food products to indicate on the label the presence of any genetically modified ingredients (which are crops grown from seeds whose genetic code has been altered through genetic engineering).&#160; Large agricultural businesses and processed-food producers did not want this change because it would reduce their profits and increase the profits of competitors who don't use genetically modified ingredients.&#160; To block this law, large agricultural businesses and processed-food producers throughout the United States funded advertising in Oregon that claimed dramatic increases in food prices would occur because of the complications of identifying and labeling genetically modified ingredients.&#160; This advertising successfully defeated the petition.&#160; More importantly it greatly reduced the chances that similar laws would be passed in other states.</p> 
<p>Concentrating money to block changes that are proposed in one state is a very effective way to block these changes from occurring in other states.&#160; This tactic is not only effective, but often occurs without the knowledge of consumers and average people in other states.&#160; State-level conflicts especially go unnoticed by the many people who depend on nationally broadcast television news and nationally published newspapers and magazines.</p> 
<p>Some laws, by their nature, are state-based, which means that state legislatures, not U.S. Congress, write these laws.&#160; As an example, most states require probate legal proceedings in all inheritance cases that exceed a specified estate value.&#160; This law requires the heirs (of a deceased person) to hire a lawyer to handle the paperwork for the inheritance, even when everyone involved agrees on who inherits what.&#160; Lawyers like probate laws because they earn lots of money doing relatively easy probate paperwork, and because most wealthy people hire lawyers to set up trusts that bypass the probate process.&#160; Let's suppose a politician runs for a seat in a state legislature and promises to introduce a bill for a law that will eliminate the probate laws in that state.&#160; Money from lawyers in all 50 states, under the coordination of the American Bar Association, would be concentrated on defeating that candidate.&#160; As a result, this legal monopoly has been preserved throughout the United States.&#160; (Interestingly the practice of probate was created in England and it was abolished in that country in 1927.)</p> 
<p>The resources of campaign contributors throughout the United States are focused on influencing politics in any state that attempts to implement any unappreciated change.&#160; This concentration of money is coordinated by organizations that carefully watch political activities in every state.&#160; As a result, it is very difficult for citizen-supported reforms to be implemented one state at a time.</p> 
<h1>Discouraged Voters</h1> 
<p>What a majority of voters really want is for government officials to put the needs of most voters before the desires of campaign contributors.&#160; This pattern is clearly revealed in these examples.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Voters want pharmaceutical companies to value the health of patients more than corporate profits.</li> 
<li>Voters want to be free to choose between lawyers, paralegals, and mediators, but lawyers want to have their services legally required even in situations that are better handled by paralegals or mediators.</li> 
<li>Voters want healthy drinking water and healthy freshwater fish even if cattle ranchers and large polluting manufacturers have to spend some money to reduce their pollution of rivers and lakes.</li> 
<li>Voters want improvements in vehicle fuel efficiency so they save money on gasoline and voters want cleaner air to breathe even if oil companies earn less profits through reduced fuel consumption.</li> 
<li>Voters want to reduce the risk of oil spills spoiling coastal zones even if that reduces oil-company profits and reduces the high salaries given to corporate executives.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The pattern is clear.&#160; Businesses &#8212; especially large corporations &#8212; contribute lots of money to politicians for the purpose of opposing what a majority of voters want.&#160; What voters want is for their health, their work-based financial situation, and their happiness to be protected by politicians.</p> 
<h1>Isn't Buying Political Influence OK?</h1> 
<p>Some people argue that people with more money deserve more influence in politics.&#160; This argument is based on the belief that people who have less money are typically less wise.&#160; Is this belief true?&#160; Partially.&#160; Many people at the bottom of the socioeconomic spectrum frequently do make unwise decisions and have inappropriate priorities.&#160; However, many middle-income and wealthy citizens also make unwise decisions.</p> 
<p>Regardless of whether they deserve it or not, there will always be legal ways for people with more money to use it to get more political influence.&#160; Newspapers, magazines, radio stations, and TV stations will gladly sell advertising space or time to virtually anyone willing to pay the price.&#160; Freedom of the press allows anyone to write and publish a book.&#160; And candidates with more financial support always have a better chance of winning an election.</p> 
<p>What needs to change is the relative influence of votes and money.&#160; In particular, if a strong majority of voters want to elect or defeat a particular candidate, votes should have more influence than money.&#160; It is unfortunate and unfair that current voting methods do not necessarily allow that to happen.</p> 
<h1>Who Is The Enemy?</h1> 
<p>Although money is at the root of lots of unfair political influence, money itself cannot be blamed for this unfair influence.&#160; Money is simply an object (and a concept) that is used by people.&#160; So who is to blame for the unfair influence of money in politics?</p> 
<p>Politicians are not the so-called bad guys.&#160; Although the desire for power and status do motivate nearly all politicians, most politicians are not intentionally greedy and selfish.&#160; Instead, most politicians genuinely try to make political choices that are in the best interests of the citizens &#8212; although each politician has a different perspective about which group of citizens are most deserving of representation.&#160; The fact that a politician must accept money from interest groups is typically regarded by politicians as a necessity that allows them to get elected so that they are in a position to help citizens.&#160; In short, politicians are not the enemy of democracy.</p> 
<p>It is easy to fall into the trap of believing that the Republican and Democratic parties are to blame for having sold themselves to the highest bidders.&#160; Yet both political parties regard themselves as having the best interests of citizens as a top priority.&#160; Political-party leaders assume that if the voters were really discontented then a third political party would grow in popularity.&#160; They aren't aware that, for reasons explained in Part Two, the U.S. Constitution indirectly stops third parties from growing.&#160; In spite of appearances to the contrary, political parties are not the enemy of democracy.</p> 
<p>The people who contribute money to politicians and political parties are not the enemies of democracy.&#160; Most of these contributors think that voters could outvote their monetary influence if the voters were frustrated enough.&#160; Some contributors are aware that voters cannot outvote a heavy monetary influence, but even these contributors do not understand why contributions are so effective.&#160; The few contributors who do understand why political contributions are so effective are simply doing what is normal according to human nature.&#160; Nearly anyone else in the same situation would do basically the same thing.&#160; For these reasons, big campaign contributors are not the enemy of democracy.</p> 
<p>Corporations have become a popular target for citizens who protest unfair government actions.&#160; Yet corporations are no more to blame than individual contributors.&#160; In spite of the high level of intelligence in corporate executives, they too are unaware of why their money buys influence.&#160; They just know it works.&#160; And nearly anyone in the same situation would do basically the same thing.&#160; Corporations and corporate executives who choose to make financial contributions are not enemies of democracy.</p> 
<p>Most television viewers, radio listeners, and newspaper readers are aware that the news media is biased.&#160; And the owners of the news media commonly bias the news intentionally.&#160; Yet their bias is primarily oriented toward favoring one political party or another.&#160; Even to the extent that the reported news is biased in favor of the businesses that advertise with them and the large corporations that own them, the news media attempts to report what is actually going on rather than intentionally trying to deceive their audience.&#160; Does the news media deserve to be labeled as an enemy of democracy?&#160; Of course not.</p> 
<p>At last we arrive at the real enemy of democracy.&#160; The real enemy is a lack of awareness.&#160; There is a lack of awareness among voters, politicians, lobbyists, campaign contributors, news reporters, and even some college professors who teach the subject of U.S. government.&#160; There is a lack of awareness as to why election results are so easily manipulated by money, and why a fair-sounding sentence in the U.S. Constitution has developed into a barrier to fair election results.&#160; There is a lack of awareness about the degree to which politicians and political parties have lost touch with the desires of a majority of voters.&#160; There is a lack of awareness as to why the campaign contributions from corporations and wealthy individuals are so effective.&#160; There is a lack of awareness as to why so many voters are very interested in news articles about the differences between political candidates from the two main political parties even though most of these voters don't like any of the available choices.&#160; And there is a lack of awareness as to why we have only two main political parties even though most voters don't really like the candidates offered by either of these parties.</p> 
<p>It is this widespread lack of awareness that is the real enemy of democracy.&#160; In Part Two you will learn what most people are not aware of, namely why there are only two main political parties in the United States, why primary election results are so easily manipulated by campaign contributions, and why political parties play inappropriate games that, unfortunately, determine the balance of power between the two main parties even though neither party represents what most voters want.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>Here are some suggestions for what you can do based on what you learned in this chapter.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If you don't already vote in primary elections, vote in primary elections.&#160; You will get the most political influence by voting in either the Republican or Democratic primaries.&#160; If getting to a polling place is awkward, find out if you can vote by mail.&#160; Although money currently has more influence than votes, voting does make a difference, especially when it is done in the Republican or Democratic primary elections.&#160; Choosing not to vote does not &#8220;send a message,&#8221; except the message that you don't care about the outcome.&#160; Other recommendations in this book deal with how you can send the message that you want election methods to be improved.</li> 
<li>If you currently donate money to the Republican or Democratic party and you only like some of the party's agenda, consider instead donating to organizations that promote the political agendas you favor.&#160; For example, if you donate money to the Democratic party because it favors environmental protection more than the Republican party, consider donating that money to an organization, such as the League of Conservation Voters, that helps to elect pro-environmental Congressmen.&#160; If you donate money to the Republican party because it favors small-business agendas more than the Democratic party, consider donating that money to an organization, such as the National Federation of Independent Business, that promotes small-business agendas.&#160; These focused organizations distribute your money to the candidates who best represent your specific political preferences.</li> 
<li>When you are in a political conversation and the emphasis is about Republican versus Democratic views, point out that the gap between Republicans and Democrats is small compared to the gap between most voters and the biggest campaign contributors.</li> 
<li>If you get discouraged by the unfairness of what goes on in U.S. politics and government, read about U.S. and world history or read about what goes on in the politics of non-democratic countries.&#160; Appreciate that you are not living in a previous time or another country.&#160; If that leads you to long for the future, keep in mind that many people living in the future will wish for the &#8220;good old days&#8221; of today.</li> 
<li>When talking about politics, look for opportunities to smile and laugh!&#160; A sense of humor is important for talking about politics without getting frustrated.</li> 
</ul> 

<h1>Chapter 3:&#160; History Made Fun:&#160; Why Do We Vote This Way?</h1> 
<p>If current election processes are unfair, why do we continue voting this way?&#160; In this chapter you will have fun learning about (or being reminded of) interesting historical events involving voting and elections, why Presidential elections involve the Electoral College, and what goes on in the main chamber and back rooms of Presidential nominating conventions.&#160; This chapter also describes seldom-mentioned attempts to use innovative voting methods in a few U.S. cities.</p> 
<h1>Voting For A King</h1> 
<p>Except for a few simple changes, the voting method we use today to elect U.S. Presidents was designed by the men who wrote the U.S. Constitution.&#160; Their design decisions were influenced by how voting was done in those days, so let's consider the voting methods that were in use just prior to when the Constitution was written.</p> 
<p>The people living in the 13 colonies of America were already familiar with voting.&#160; King George the Third in England was their ruler, and that was not negotiable.&#160; But the colonists were allowed to vote for the representatives who met at their colony's capitol.&#160; These elected representatives formed the assembly (what we would now call a legislature) that wrote the colony's laws.</p> 
<p>There were strict limits on the laws created in the colonial assemblies.&#160; If a colony's governor didn't like a proposed law, he didn't approve it and it was discarded.&#160; What happened if a governor accepted a law that was too liberal?&#160; He would be replaced.&#160; If you wonder why, consider that eight of the thirteen governors were appointed by King George, and three other governors were appointed by people who had received the charter for their colony from King George.&#160; The result was that colonial assemblies had no control over taxes, tariffs, and other important matters.&#160; The laws passed in the assemblies only dealt with details the king was not concerned with.</p> 
<p>The taxes and tariffs imposed on the colonies were as high as the king and his advisers thought the colonists would tolerate.&#160; They miscalculated.&#160; The colonists repeatedly expressed their displeasure with the high taxes, tariffs, and other financial burdens.&#160; The most well-known expression was the so-called Boston Tea Party at which colonists dumped English tea into Boston harbor.&#160; In retaliation, King George imposed hardships such as closing Boston Harbor, increasing military rule, sending ten thousand soldiers to enforce new restrictions, and forcing colonists to house and feed the soldiers.</p> 
<p>Conventions, called congresses, were held in Philadelphia to respond to the oppression.&#160; The people at the congresses were members of the colonial assemblies, plus some people chosen by those assemblies.&#160; The first and second times they met, the congresses produced written protests and petitions asking King George to stop his oppressive actions.&#160; After the second petition King George responded by sending more soldiers and declaring the colonies in revolt.&#160; The increased oppression erupted into violence in Massachusetts at Lexington and Concord.</p> 
<p>The third time the congress met, a majority of the representatives supported the idea of declaring independence from England.&#160; One of the representatives, Thomas Jefferson, was known as a fine writer, so he was asked to write what became the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>.&#160; The congress made a few wording changes and then a majority of the representatives voted in favor of the written declaration.&#160; The representatives signed the document on July 4, 1776, and then it was delivered to King George the Third.</p> 
<p>It took six and a half years of deadly fighting for the thirteen colonies to convert their declared independence into actual independence.&#160; Military victory was achieved in the autumn of 1781.&#160; They were lucky.&#160; It was expensive for England to ship soldiers and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean.&#160; More significantly, England was also at war with France in Europe, which meant that the full force of the English military was not available for fighting in the colonies.&#160; Another important factor was that France supplied soldiers to help the colonists fight their common enemy, England.</p> 
<p>Up until this time the worldwide tradition was that nations were ruled by kings and queens who stayed in power until power was turned over to one of their sons, or sometimes to the carefully chosen husband of a daughter.&#160; The big exception to this pattern of inherited power was when the leader of a successful revolution took over as the new king.&#160; In the case of the successful American revolution, the revolutionary leader, George Washington, chose not to become king, even though many of the former colonists wanted him to become their king.</p> 
<p>This situation was a dramatic departure from the past.&#160; It was an unprecedented opportunity to design a new government that didn't involve a king.</p> 
<p>Alas, the new nation's first attempt to design a government failed.&#160; In retrospect, that's probably not surprising.&#160; After all, there were no other nations based on full democracy, so the new nation had no examples to follow.&#160; What they created, which was described in a document titled the <i>Articles of Confederation</i>, was basically a continuation of the congresses that had been meeting in Philadelphia (and York in Pennsylvania during part of the war).&#160; The assemblies elected representatives to attend a Congress in Philadelphia, and laws were created if a majority of the representatives voted in favor of them.&#160; However, there were many shortcomings, including no provisions for enforcing the laws and no provisions for collecting taxes to pay military expenses.</p> 
<p>After the failed first attempt, representatives from the thirteen assemblies met again in Philadelphia in 1787 (eleven years after the <i>Declaration of Independence</i>).&#160; The representatives spent four months writing the Constitution of the United States.</p> 
<p>This revolutionary experiment in democracy included an elected President.&#160; The President's responsibility was to enforce the laws passed by Congress.&#160; In a sense, the President amounted to a king whose actions were limited by the lawmakers in Congress.&#160; More importantly, the President amounted to a king who could be replaced at the next election if the voters became displeased with his actions.&#160; Impeachment was added as a way to get rid of an unpopular President without waiting for the next election &#8212; after Benjamin Franklin pointed out that assassination was the only other alternative.</p> 
<p>This time the representatives of the former colonists got it mostly right.&#160; To accommodate what they didn't get right, the Constitution allowed for amendments that would fix any inadequacies.&#160; And inadequacies did arise, especially regarding how Presidents, Vice Presidents, and Senators are elected.&#160; This is not surprising when you consider that the United States was the first nation to become a full democracy.</p> 
<h1>Political Parties?&#160; Twelfth Amendment To The Rescue</h1> 
<p>The writers of the Constitution did not anticipate that political parties would develop.&#160; The writers assumed that Presidents would be chosen based on who the voters thought would be the wisest leader.&#160; With this logic it makes sense that the second-most popular candidate for President would become Vice President.&#160; This is what the Constitution originally specified.&#160; And this selection process worked fine for the first three elections.&#160; (John Adams was Vice President during George Washington's two terms as President, and Thomas Jefferson was Vice President during John Adams' one-term Presidency.)</p> 
<p>In the fourth Presidential election, the two most popular candidates, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, were political enemies.&#160; Thomas Jefferson was elected President, so Aaron Burr became Vice President.&#160; The result was that the President, Thomas Jefferson, and the Vice President, Aaron Burr, had to govern together even though they bitterly disagreed with one another.</p> 
<p>By the following election the Twelfth Amendment to the Constitution had been passed and this big flaw was fixed.&#160; The solution was to choose the President and Vice President in what amounted to separate elections.&#160; The two elections were linked because ballots listed the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates in pairs.&#160; The Amendment did not mention anything about political parties, yet it enabled the Vice President to be from the same political party as the President.</p> 
<h1>How To Vote For Unknown Candidates</h1> 
<p>When the Constitution of the United States was written, the fastest form of communication was through hand-written letters carried on horseback.&#160; Telephones, airplanes, railroads, automobiles, and even telegraphs had not yet been invented.&#160; There were no televisions and no radios and not even any phonographs, so political speeches were only heard by the people who were physically present.&#160; Descriptions of political speeches spread only through newspapers, word-of-mouth, and letters.&#160; Photography had not yet been invented, so written descriptions, painted portraits, printed drawings, and seeing someone in person were the only ways to know what famous, still-living people &#8212; such as Benjamin Franklin and George Washington &#8212; looked like.&#160; These limitations meant that the only way for a voter to hear or see a political candidate giving a speech was to be physically present at the time and place of the speech.</p> 

<p>Up to that time, throughout all history, voters only chose from among people who represented a small area.&#160; This allowed the candidates to travel to a relatively few key cities and towns and give speeches that many of the voters could come to hear and see.</p> 
<p>The voters of the new nation were spread over a vast area that was too big for a Presidential candidate to cover by horseback or horse-drawn carriage.&#160; Just giving one speech in each of the thirteen states would have required months of travel.&#160; This meant that electing a President was the first time in history when a large number of people would be choosing from candidates who most of the voters had never seen or heard.</p> 
<p>The writers of the U.S. Constitution wisely recognized the importance of requiring that a President be elected by a majority (more than half) of the voters.&#160; Yet the only way to balance this need for a majority with the inability of candidates to meet a significant number of voters was to involve intermediate voters.&#160; The Constitution calls these people electors, and collectively the electors are called the Electoral College.</p> 
<p>During the writing of the U.S. Constitution, representatives from many of the thirteen states repeatedly insisted that the new government should not get involved in the details of what went on within the states, beyond what was needed.&#160; Yet electing a President required some way to combine the votes from among the states.&#160; The wise solution was to give each state an appropriate number of electoral votes and let each state decide how to translate the votes at the local level into the electoral votes at the state level.&#160; The number of electoral votes assigned to each state was simply the number of Congressmen (Senators plus Representatives) from that state.&#160; (In case you are interested, Congress initially consisted of 26 Senators and 65 Representatives.)</p> 
<p>All the states chose to allow voters to elect electors in almost the same way as Congressional representatives.&#160; This means that voters were given ballots that contained a list of well-known people in the area &#8212; typically lawyers, prominent businessmen, and local elected officials &#8212; who promised to choose wisely from among the Presidential candidates.&#160; Voting was done based on which elector the voter thought would best represent his interests.&#160; (Women were not allowed to vote until 1920.)&#160; As a simple example, a businessman was likely to choose an elector who was a successful businessman, and a farmer was likely to choose an elector who was a well-respected farmer.&#160; The winning electors traveled to the state capitol where, in a meeting, they voted for the Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates.</p> 
<p>What happened after the electoral votes were cast?&#160; Each state sent their electoral votes to Congress where the votes were read aloud to a gathering of both Senators and Representatives.&#160; This tradition continues today.&#160; What can happen after Congress hears the results?&#160; That question is answered in Chapter 10.&#160; In the meantime it's important to better understand electoral votes.</p> 
<p>Did the writers of the U.S. Constitution make a mistake by not allowing voters to directly elect the President and Vice President?&#160; No.&#160; Back then the travel and communication limitations made it impossible for most voters to see or hear a Presidential candidate, so most voters were not in a position to judge Presidential candidates.</p> 
<p>What about now?&#160; We no longer have the travel and communication limitations that existed back in the days when the Constitution was written.&#160; Voters of today see and hear Presidential candidates on television and radio and can make informed choices among the candidates.&#160; Wouldn't it be better to eliminate the use of electors and electoral votes?&#160; Yes, electors can be eliminated, but electoral votes are still needed.</p> 
<p>To understand the distinction between needing electoral votes but not needing electors, let's look at the important role electors used to play, and then look at their very limited role in today's elections.</p> 
<h1>Electors: The Original Job Description</h1> 
<p>Imagine being a district's victorious elector.&#160; This means your friends, relatives, acquaintances, and people who heard good things about you marked your name on the ballot, and you received the most votes in your district.&#160; As a result you travel by horseback, wagon, or carriage to the state capitol.</p> 
<p>At the state capitol you meet the electors who won the elections in the other districts of your state.&#160; All of you have been entrusted with making a wise choice as to the next President and Vice President of the United States.&#160; If you were to count the number of electors present (assuming everyone made it), the count would equal the number of your state's Representatives in the House of Representatives plus two (which is the number of Senators in any state).</p> 
<p>The process of voting in the state capitol would probably start with an official-sounding person reading off the names of the electors and their districts.&#160; When your name is called you would declare the name of the person you think should be the next President.&#160; The other electors would do likewise.&#160; At the end of the roll call, if any of the Presidential candidates received a majority of votes, that candidate would receive all the state's electoral votes.</p> 
<p>However, in many elections during the early years of the nation, usually there would be more than two Presidential candidates, so none of the candidates would be likely to receive a majority of votes in the first round of voting.&#160; Between rounds of voting electors would try to convince one another to shift their vote.&#160; Some electors would change their minds based on what other electors said about the candidates.&#160; Electors who supported an unpopular candidate especially would be encouraged to give up on that candidate and shift their votes to one of the more popular candidates.</p> 
<p>The discussions and rounds of voting were repeated until one of the candidates received a majority of the electors' votes.&#160; That candidate would receive the state's electoral votes for President, and his Vice Presidential running mate would receive the state's electoral votes for Vice President.</p> 
<p>In uncommon circumstances, usually involving stubbornness, electors might agree to split (but not necessarily in equal amounts) their state's electoral votes between two candidates.&#160; This resolution could even occur in situations where a majority of the electors supported the same candidate.&#160; How could this happen?&#160; Because the Constitution does not specify how the electors are supposed to translate their preferences into the electoral votes sent to Congress.&#160; Instead, state laws, which vary from state to state, govern what the electors can and cannot do.&#160; As a recent example of unpredictability, one of the Washington DC electors chose not to cast his electoral vote in the 2000 Presidential election.</p> 
<p>Now you can appreciate why the writers of the Constitution required the use of electors instead of using direct voting by eligible citizens.&#160; Imagine voting without electors, remembering that news traveled at the speed of horseback, at best.&#160; Many people would have to travel by horseback, wagon, or walking to the nearest town to vote.&#160; It would take at least a couple of days for all the votes in a state to be counted.&#160; Usually there would be more than two candidates, so it would be unlikely that any of them would receive a majority of votes.&#160; As a result, official notices would need to be posted at markets, at gathering places, and in newspapers to announce another round of voting at least two weeks later.&#160; The long delay would allow farmers who only went to town occasionally to find out about the election, and to allow voters time to choose from among the remaining candidates after they found out which candidates had been eliminated.&#160; Then the rural voters would again have to travel to town &#8212; by horseback, wagon, or walking &#8212; to vote.&#160; If the new results didn't produce a majority, yet another round of voting &#8212; which would take at least two more weeks &#8212; would be needed.&#160; From start to finish the process might have taken several months &#8212; and require lots of horseback riding and shoe repairs.&#160; Obviously direct elections were not compatible with the wise desire for a majority outcome.</p> 
<h1>What Electors Do Now</h1> 
<p>As photography, radios, and then televisions allowed voters to become more informed about Presidential candidates, the voters wanted to vote for specific candidates rather than voting for specific electors.&#160; At the same time, the dramatically increasing U.S. population, combined with a fixed total number of electoral votes, caused electors to represent many more people, to the point where voters no longer recognized the names of the electors on the ballot.</p> 
<p>To meet this need, states passed laws requiring electors to reveal in advance which Presidential candidate each elector preferred.&#160; Then the name of that Presidential candidate appeared on the ballot alongside the name of the elector.</p> 
<p>As voters became increasingly aware of the election process, they became frustrated by the occasional electors who promised to vote for a specific candidate &#8212; the one next to their name on the ballot &#8212; and instead voted for a different candidate, even on the first round of voting.&#160; This problem was solved by requiring electors to keep their promise to at least initially vote for the Presidential candidate whose name appears on the ballot next to theirs.&#160; This change was implemented by state laws, not by changing the U.S. Constitution.</p> 
<p>Another change that had been taking place was that U.S. politics was evolving into a two-sided contest, with only two dominant political parties.&#160; (In Chapter 10 you will learn why.)&#160; This change meant that a majority of votes for one Presidential candidate or the other was normally achieved on the first round of voting by electors.&#160; Combined with the lack of flexibility in the first round of voting, the need for only one round of voting meant that electors no longer had a personal voice in election results.&#160; Their role became symbolic.</p> 
<p>Eventually, only the names of the Presidential candidates, along with their Vice Presidential running mates, appeared on the ballot, and that is the way it remains today.&#160; Because of this, many voters now mistakenly believe that they are directly voting for the President and Vice President.&#160; Instead we as voters are actually voting for an unknown elector who, in turn, is obligated to vote the way we expect.</p> 
<h1>Birth Of Primary Elections</h1> 
<p>So far the discussions in this chapter apply to what we now call general elections.&#160; These are the elections specified in the U.S. Constitution.&#160; Originally these were the only kinds of elections, so in the early days of this nation those elections were simply called <i>the elections</i>.&#160; In 1831 the Antimasonic party held the first Presidential nominating convention, and soon after all the political parties conducted Presidential primary elections.</p> 
<p>Why did primary elections arise?&#160; Political parties quickly learned that it was in their best interests to have only one Presidential candidate and only one Vice Presidential candidate in the general election.&#160; This strategy greatly increased the chances of a candidate from that party winning a majority of electoral votes.&#160; If instead there were two or more Presidential candidates from the same political party, the voters in that party tended to split their votes among the candidates, making it easier for a single Presidential candidate in the other political party to win a majority.&#160; Also remember that electors were involved.&#160; The more choices there were, the more an elector would be inclined to shift his electoral vote to someone the citizen voters liked less.&#160; For these reasons political parties began to use primary elections to reduce the number of candidates to a single Presidential candidate and a single Vice Presidential candidate.</p> 
<p>Primary elections occur a few months before the general election.&#160; This allows time for the political parties to hold nominating conventions.&#160; At these conventions each party chooses its Presidential candidate.&#160; Then the Presidential candidate, with advice from top political-party leaders, chooses the Vice Presidential candidate.</p> 
<h1>Delegates At The Convention Circus</h1> 
<p>How do political parties allow their voters to choose from among more than two Presidential candidates and arrive at a winner receiving a majority of votes?&#160; They use intermediate voters, which is the same technique that's used for Presidential general elections.</p> 
<p>In the Presidential primary election, intermediate voters are called delegates.&#160; They basically serve a function that is similar to what electors do in the general election.&#160; The delegates arrive at a majority decision after as many rounds of voting as it takes to achieve the majority.</p> 
<p>Delegates are chosen by the political parties.&#160; Frequently the delegates are people who have worked hard to promote candidates from that party.&#160; In other words, being chosen as a delegate is often used as a reward for political-party campaigning.</p> 
<p>In the past, Presidential nominating conventions were big social parties, with lots of alcoholic beverages being consumed.&#160; Of course the Republican and Democratic political parties eventually insisted on better behavior at the parties, er, conventions so as not to alienate voters.&#160; But they are still sometimes compared to a three-ring circus, because so much goes on simultaneously.</p> 
<p>Originally each delegate simply promised to use wise judgment in voting at the national nominating convention.&#160; Of course voters were frequently disappointed by how some delegates voted, just as they were frequently disappointed by electors.&#160; Therefore the same solution was used.</p> 
<p>Delegates now have to promise to vote for the candidate they claim to represent.&#160; Furthermore, a delegate must continue to support that Presidential candidate through a certain number of rounds of voting at the convention, or until the candidate releases the delegates from their pledge.&#160; Some rules specify that if the candidate receives less than a certain percentage of the vote the delegate can vote for someone else.</p> 
<p>At the nominating convention, there are more delegates pledged to the more popular candidates, and fewer delegates pledged to the less popular candidates.&#160; If a majority of voters prefer the same Presidential candidate, a majority of delegates are likely to vote for that candidate, and that candidate will appropriately win.</p> 
<p>Where the conventions get interesting (besides the partying) is if none of the Presidential candidates wins a majority of votes on the first round of voting.&#160; At this point the delegates for the least-popular candidate usually switch to voting for one of the more popular candidates.&#160; Stubbornness would often arise in these rounds of voting.&#160; Yet eventually, after enough rounds of voting, a majority of delegates vote for the same Presidential candidate, causing that candidate to win.</p> 
<p>After a Presidential candidate is selected, lots of boring and rousing speeches are given.&#160; During that time the Presidential candidate and top political-party leaders participate in backroom meetings to choose the Vice Presidential candidate.&#160; Back at the convention hall the newly chosen Vice Presidential candidate is announced.&#160; Notice that the delegates do not choose the Vice Presidential candidate.&#160; This makes sense inasmuch as the President must work with the Vice President.&#160; Often one of the losing candidates is offered the Vice Presidential spot.&#160; Usually other possible running mates are also considered.&#160; One important factor in choosing a Vice Presidential candidate is that the Constitution requires that a President and Vice President must be residents of different states.</p> 
<p>At the end of the convention the names of that party's Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates are known.&#160; Political parties also take the opportunity to use Presidential nominating conventions to form and announce the party's platform, which is a formal statement of the political party's agenda, goals, and priorities.</p> 
<p>What you won't ever see reported in the news is the active participation of people who donate lots of money to the political party.&#160; These interactions occur between financial backers and party leaders, sometimes prior to the convention and sometimes in hotel rooms, hallways, and meeting rooms during the convention.&#160; If a majority has not yet been reached in the first round of voting, party leaders may encourage the delegates of less-popular candidates to support a party-preferred candidate.&#160; The party leaders also influence the party platform &#8212; to fit what big-money donors are willing to accept.&#160; And when it comes time to choose the party's Vice Presidential candidate, the party leaders are mindful of what the big financial contributors would prefer.</p> 
<h1>Plurality Voting Is The Big Weakness In Fairness</h1> 
<p>So far in this chapter the focus has been on Presidential elections where the goal is for one of the candidates to receive a majority &#8212; more than half &#8212; of the votes.&#160; In contrast to majority voting, a different method called plurality voting is used in most other elections throughout the United States.&#160; Most Congressmen, Governors, state representatives, Sheriffs, Mayors, and city-council members are elected using plurality voting.&#160; In plurality voting, whichever candidate receives the most votes is declared the winner.</p> 
<p>A big advantage of plurality voting is that it does not require the involvement of intermediate voters.&#160; Remember that in Presidential elections the intermediate voters are the political-party delegates who gather at the Presidential nominating conventions, and the members of the Electoral College who meet in the state capitols.&#160; This advantage of not involving intermediate voters accounts for why most general elections in most states, counties, and cities throughout the United States use plurality voting.</p> 
<p>In Chapter 5 you will learn why <b>plurality voting is very vulnerable to manipulation</b>.&#160; So why do we still use plurality voting throughout the United States?&#160; Because until computers became widely available there was no better alternative.</p> 
<h1>No Party?&#160; No Vote In The Primary</h1> 
<p>A voter sees on the primary ballot only the candidates who are in their own political party.&#160; For example, if you are registered as a Democrat, only Democratic candidates appear on your primary ballot.&#160; You don't get to vote on the candidates in the other political parties because the purpose of primary elections is to find out which candidates in each political party are the most popular among the voters registered in that party.</p> 
<p>If you do not claim a connection with any political party, what do you see on the primary-election ballot?&#160; Not much.&#160; You are referred to as an independent voter and you only get to vote for non-partisan (not related to political parties) races.&#160; These nonpartisan races involve offices such as judges and supervisors, for which it is not appropriate to elect people who are openly biased toward one political party.</p> 
<p>After initially registering as an independent voter, and then discovering that independent voters have no influence in the outcome of primary elections, countless voters have chosen to join one political party or the other so they can vote for some of the candidates in primary elections.&#160; In these cases party registrations do not reveal the political views of the voter.</p> 
<p>Although most voters register with the political party they prefer, some voters register with the opposing political party because it allows them to help eliminate the least-appealing candidates in the other party.&#160; A related approach used by some couples is for one spouse to register as a Republican and the other spouse to register as a Democrat, allowing them to have an influence in the primary elections of both parties.</p> 
<p>It is important to remember that <b>membership in a political party does not mean that a voter shares the beliefs of the political party to which he or she belongs</b>.&#160; People who forget this fact mistakenly believe that the Republican and Democratic parties are so popular that nearly everyone wants to join them.&#160; The reality is that these two parties have a monopoly.&#160; Who else has electable candidates?</p> 
<h1>Letting Other People Choose Senators?&#160; Not Anymore</h1> 
<p>Originally the U.S. Constitution specified that Senators were to be chosen by the state legislatures.&#160; This means that voters never saw the names of Senatorial candidates on the ballot.&#160; Instead, the representatives in the state legislature did the voting for Senators without the involvement of citizen voters.</p> 
<p>The results were not usually representative.&#160; Typically whichever political party had a majority in the state legislature was able to elect a Senator from their own political party.&#160; If the same political party still had a majority when the other Senator was elected, both Senators would be from the same political party.&#160; It might take years before a Senator from the other political party was elected, even if almost half the voters in the state were from that unrepresented party.</p> 
<p>Finally, in 1913, ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment allowed voters to directly elect Senators.&#160; This means that intermediate voters in the form of state legislators were eliminated.</p> 
<p>There is still some unfairness in the results of electing Senators.&#160; This unfairness involves district boundaries and is described in Chapter 9.&#160; But at least the fairness in electing Senators has greatly improved from the days when state legislatures chose them.</p> 
<h1>Getting Distracted By Counting Votes Fairly</h1> 
<p>In the early years of the United States the number of votes cast for each candidate was widely known to involve errors.&#160; Today, as evidenced by the counting of votes in Florida during the 2000 Presidential election, the number of votes cast for each candidate still involves errors, but the errors are not as dramatic as they used to be.</p> 
<p>In the previous century it was common for voters to deposit a pre-marked ballot that was cut out of a newspaper, given to employees by employers, or supplied by the voter's preferred political party.&#160; It was easy for observers at election polls to see which kind of ballot a voter deposited into the ballot box.&#160; This lack of privacy and the threat of an employee getting fired for depositing the wrong ballot made it easy for corrupt employers to influence election results.&#160; Of course this unfairness was ended by handing out unmarked ballots and requiring voters to mark the ballots in secrecy.&#160; Interestingly the people who opposed this change claimed that many voters might not be able to handle marking a ballot.</p> 
<p>In the 1800s it was not uncommon for poor people to earn money on election day by voting extra times at different polling places using the names of people who were recently deceased.&#160; The money, the names of deceased voters, and even transportation between polling places, was provided by corrupt people who worked for corrupt politicians.&#160; This tactic has disappeared now that computers easily generate up-to-date lists of registered voters.</p> 
<p>For many reasons the use of computers has improved the accuracy of election results.&#160; Unfortunately the use of computers also introduces new possibilities for manipulating election results.&#160; As examples, during the 2004 Presidential election, a computer in a North Carolina precinct produced a vote count that exceeded the number of registered voters in the precinct, and a computer in Ohio produced negative vote counts (which, if they had been accepted, would have canceled out real votes in other precincts).&#160; It will be decades before it's possible to ensure fairness in paperless voting.&#160; In the meantime computers can be used to facilitate voting if they produce a printed ballot that the voter can look at, verify its correctness, and then deposit into the ballot box for later counting.</p> 
<p>Another issue of concern is that state election officials sometimes rely on the numbers calculated by the media.&#160; There is a media-supported organization that, on election night, supplies &#8220;official&#8221; election results to the main television networks and the Associated Press and United Press International (which supply newspapers with news stories).&#160; This coordinated approach eliminates the embarrassment of different networks and different newspapers broadcasting and publishing conflicting numbers in their election results.&#160; Sometimes, especially in close races, election officials rely on the media-collected numbers.</p> 
<p>A great deal of attention gets focused on these and other vote-counting issues as if they are a major source of unfair election results.&#160; In reality, <b>inaccuracies in vote counting are not a major source of unfairness in U.S. elections</b>.&#160; After all, vote counting mostly deals with the balance between the Republican and Democratic parties, and ignores the balance between voters and the biggest campaign contributors.&#160; Even complete accuracy in counting today's ballots would not reduce the huge gap between what most voters want and what politicians do.</p> 
<h1>Setting Campaign Finance Limits?&#160; Ha!</h1> 
<p>There have been many attempts in the United States to establish limits on the money flowing to candidates and political parties.&#160; But each time a limit is established, people and organizations with money find a way around the limits.</p> 
<p>After the Civil War there was a major scandal involving the corporation (named Credit Mobilier) that was formed to build the transcontinental railroad.&#160; The corporation's board of directors overcharged the government and protected their excessive profits through payoffs to government officials.&#160; The payoffs included shares of stock in the corporation that were given to key Congressmen.&#160; Efforts to reclaim the illegal profits failed, so taxpayers got stuck paying for the loss.&#160; This scandal eventually led to campaign-finance laws.&#160; One such law made it illegal for corporations and national banks to contribute to Congressional and Presidential candidates.&#160; These and other laws were passed in 1907, 1910, and 1911.&#160; The laws were combined and expanded to create the Corrupt Practices Act of 1925.</p> 
<p>The Corrupt Practices Act of 1925 had many loopholes.&#160; For example, spending limits only applied to money that was spent with the candidate's &#8220;knowledge and consent.&#8221; Disclosures about contributions were not made available to the public, and there were no audits to verify the correctness of the disclosures.&#160; Primary elections were excluded from the law.&#160; Even the ban on contributions from corporations and national banks was easily evaded using methods such as individual bank officers making campaign contributions and then getting reimbursed by the bank.&#160; In fact the laws have so many loopholes that this legislation has not led to even one prosecution.</p> 
<p>In 1971 Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act which imposed limits on campaign contributions and expenses.&#160; Here are some highlights of its provisions and consequences.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In 1976 the Supreme Court decided that campaign contributions and expenditures are forms of political speech protected by the First Amendment, so the limits on contributions from individuals was nullified.</li> 
<li>Another provision of the Act prohibits contributions from corporations, national banks, and labor unions.&#160; However, corporations and labor unions were allowed to contribute money to Political Action Committees &#8212; also called PACs &#8212; and these PACs are allowed to contribute money to Congressional candidates.&#160; The use of Political Action Committees was so effective that the number of PACs associated with corporations and labor unions grew from 290 in 1974 to more than 2,000 PACs in 1998.</li> 
<li>What did remain effective from the Federal Election Campaign Act was a requirement for the public disclosure of campaign receipts and expenditures.&#160; However, tracing the flow of money through Political Action Committees, state-specific political-party organizations, federal political-party organizations, and other organizations is challenging.&#160; More significantly, voters rarely find an experienced candidate on the ballot who hasn't received lots of campaign contributions.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In 2002 Congress passed the McCain-Feingold campaign-finance act that dramatically limits contributions that can be made to the Republican and Democratic national committees.&#160; However, the amounts of money that can be contributed to state-specific political parties (such as the California Democratic party and the Wisconsin Republican party) were increased, and no limit was set on the number of state-specific political parties to which someone can contribute.&#160; Other loopholes have also been found.&#160; In fact, knowledge of its loopholes is what made the Republican and Democratic parties willing to allow the legislation to pass.</p> 
<p>The presence of loopholes in campaign finance limits shouldn't be surprising.&#160; After all, who writes the laws that limit election contributions?&#160; The people receiving the money!&#160; More specifically the recipients are politicians who are dependent on the Republican and Democratic parties, and these two parties are heavily controlled by campaign contributors who don't want to lose their extra influence.</p> 
<p>New Zealand has established rigorous limits on financial contributions to politicians and political parties.&#160; But each time a law is passed to establish a limit, people and organizations with money find a legal way to get around the limit.&#160; For example, financial contributions usually occur shortly before elections, so a law was passed to ban donations during the three months prior to an election.&#160; What happened?&#160; Contributions are now prepaid before the three-month ban begins.&#160; New Zealand's limits on financial campaign contributions and spending limits are far stricter than the limits in the United States.&#160; Yet their elections are still heavily influenced by campaign contributions.</p> 
<p>Setting campaign contribution limits and spending limits has been, and will continue to be, fruitless in terms of significantly reducing the influence of campaign contributions.&#160; Why?&#160; Because there is a well-known way to sidestep even the most carefully designed limits.&#160; This technique is explained in the next section.</p> 
<h1>Ultimate Money Loophole: Issue Advocacy</h1> 
<p>Suppose campaign contributions could somehow be completely stopped.&#160; How can wealthy individuals and corporations support candidates without contributing money to the candidate's campaign?&#160; They can pay for television advertisements that do not mention the candidate by name.&#160; Instead, the words and images in the advertisement support particular political positions that are only held by the preferred candidate (or candidates).</p> 
<p>This approach is called issue advocacy, and the advertisements are called issue ads.&#160; It will always be legal because it is protected by the First Amendment, particularly the portion that prevents laws from &#8220;abridging the freedom of speech or of the press.&#8221; Another reason issue advocacy cannot be stopped is that the candidates themselves cannot stop such advertising.</p> 
<p>Suppose that during a Presidential election campaign the National Rifle Association (NRA) runs a television advertisement that glowingly inspires a voter to want to protect the right of citizens to carry guns.&#160; If one of the Presidential candidates has spoken out in favor of laws that restrict people from buying assault weapons, this advertisement clearly supports the other Presidential candidate.&#160; Notice that the money raised (presumably from weapons-related businesses and NRA members) to pay for this ad is not counted as a donation to that Presidential candidate's campaign, and the cost of the ad is not counted as a campaign expense.&#160; Therefore, any laws that limit campaign contributions or campaign expenses would have no effect on limiting these advertisements.</p> 
<p>Issue advocacy has already been used in the United States, and it is commonly used in New Zealand where campaign financing is very restricted.</p> 
<p>Issue advocacy cannot be stopped.&#160; Yes, it is possible to block them to some extent by splitting hairs about what does, and doesn't, constitute a campaign expense.&#160; But sooner or later any such attempts will infringe on the right of free speech.</p> 
<p>Fortunately it doesn't matter that issue advocacy cannot be blocked.&#160; Just as with candidate-specific advertisements, such advertising cannot persuade a majority of voters to vote for a candidate who the voters dislike.&#160; Conversations among friends, online communication, and the fair reporting of news make it difficult for advertisements to overcome a strong dislike for a candidate.&#160; The only arrangement that can cause voters to elect candidates the voters dislike is the situation we currently have, namely the use of voting methods that lead to both candidates in the general election being equally disliked.</p> 
<h1>Publicly Finance Monopolies?&#160; Why?</h1> 
<p>Some citizens have supported the idea of public funding for Presidential campaigns, which are the most expensive election campaigns.&#160; Public funding means that taxpayer money is provided to the candidate in return for a promise not to exceed specific spending limits.&#160; On the surface this sounds like a good way to make funding available to candidates who don't compromise their principles by accepting money from special interests.</p> 
<p>Under current conditions, public funding for candidates doesn't make sense.&#160; Why?&#160; Because the candidates who are publicly funded would often be defeated in their primary elections, where unfair plurality voting is used.&#160; Also consider that the biggest campaign contributors can simply spend more money.&#160; Why waste taxpayer money trying to defeat much-better-funded candidates?</p> 
<p>What about the checkbox on federal income-tax forms that says: <i>Presidential Election Campaign: Do you, or your spouse if filing a joint return, want &#36;3 to go to this fund</i>?&#160; It provides money for public funding of Presidential campaigns.&#160; Checking the box does not deduct the money from that taxpayer's account, but taxpayers do end up paying for money put into that fund.</p> 
<p>The movement to offer public funding of election campaigns simply reveals that voters are currently unable to defeat undesired well-funded candidates simply by voting.&#160; This undemocratic situation reveals an inadequacy in voting methods, not a need to compete against special-interest money by using taxpayer's money.</p> 
<h1>Misdirected Term Limits</h1> 
<p>At the end of the 1900s a few states passed laws that limited the number of terms a politician can serve in the state legislature.&#160; There were also attempts to limit the number of terms a Congressman could serve, but such state laws were identified by the U.S. Supreme Court as unconstitutional.</p> 
<p>Term limits are based on a widespread desire to &#8220;throw the bums out&#8221; of office.&#160; The hope is that a new politician is not going to be as influenced by campaign contributions.&#160; This belief is based on the fact that a politician who gets reelected many times finds it increasingly easy to gather huge campaign contributions that protect the politician from losing elections.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately some of the politicians who exceeded the new term limits turned out to be politicians who a majority of voters liked.&#160; This should not have been surprising because the more elections a politician has won, the more carefully the voters have been able to scrutinize his or her actions, and the more times the politician has been favorably compared to other politicians.</p> 
<p>The fact that voters aren't able to vote an undesired long-term politician out of office reveals the inadequacy of the election process.&#160; After all, if fair voting methods were used, a majority of voters could easily remove a politician they didn't like.&#160; They wouldn't have to resort to the indirect approach of passing term-limit laws.</p> 
<h1>Women And Minorities Want Representation Too</h1> 
<p>Among women, African-Americans, Latinos, Asian-Americans, and Native Americans, the most noticeable unfairness in elections is the scarcity of elected officials who are women and minorities.</p> 
<p>At the beginning of the 1900s, when women couldn't vote and African-American men were illegally prevented from voting, every member of Congress was a white male.&#160; The representation of women and minorities has improved during the past few decades.&#160; Now, after the 2004 election, among the 100 Senators there are fourteen women, two Latinos, one African-American, and two who are categorized as Asian-American or Pacific-Islanders (both from Hawaii).&#160; Out of the 435 members of the House of Representatives there are now 68 women (some of whom also are minorities), 42 African-Americans, 24 Latinos, one Native American, and four who are categorized as Asian-American or Pacific-Islander.</p> 
<p>These numbers are still inadequate from the perspective of many women and most minorities.&#160; Some people would claim that the proportion of women and minorities in Congress should match the proportion of women and minorities among the general population.&#160; That claim suggests that half the members of Congress should be women.&#160; Additional evidence of inadequate representation by women is that many other democratic nations have a higher proportion of women elected to government.</p> 
<h1>Voting Variations</h1> 
<p>To improve the representation of women and minorities there have been experiments with alternate voting methods.&#160; The methods that have been tried in the United States include the single transferable vote and cumulative voting.&#160; Currently there are efforts to promote the use of instant-runoff voting.&#160; These alternatives to plurality voting are described in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7.</p> 
<p>For now what is important to know about these voting methods is they do not produce fair results.&#160; However, from the perspective of minorities, some of the experiments with cumulative voting and the single transferable vote have been successful.</p> 
<p>Cumulative voting was used in Illinois from 1870 to 1980.&#160; It was used to elect members of the state legislature.&#160; As a result of this change, the number of elected African-American politicians increased from three in 1894 to 21 in 1980.&#160; African-American voters liked these results.&#160; Of course many other people didn't like the results.&#160; The method was abandoned because of claims that it cost too much and was too complex, and because of low voter turnout in the election that ended it.</p> 
<p>The single transferable vote is still used in Cambridge Massachusetts, having been adopted in 1941.&#160; There it is used to elect city-council members and school-committee members.&#160; The single transferable vote is described in Chapter 7.&#160; For now what is significant is that the method provides some advantages but also has major disadvantages in terms of fairness.</p> 
<p>Why do cumulative voting and the single transferable vote produce results that are unfair yet appreciated?&#160; Keep in mind these methods are used to elect two or more officials in equivalent seats, such as in a legislature or on a city council.&#160; When traditional voting methods are used, such elections block minorities from electing candidates with minority-based political orientations.&#160; In contrast, cumulative voting and the single transferable vote allow minorities to finally elect minority-supported candidates.&#160; Ironically this apparent fairness occurs because the voting methods are vulnerable to strategic voting techniques that are explained in Part Two.</p> 
<p>Even without making changes in voting methods the representation of women and minorities has improved.&#160; Why?&#160; Because decades ago the Republican and Democratic parties began to compete with each other for the impression that they support the political desires of women and minorities.</p> 
<h1>Avoiding A Tyranny Of The Majority</h1> 
<p>Back in the days of kings it was common for a king to pass laws that infringed on what we now regard as basic freedoms.&#160; For example, it was common for a king to destroy books and printing presses if he didn't like what was printed, ban religions other than his own, disarm citizens to prevent armed rebellion, and conduct trials in ways that produced the verdicts the king wanted.</p> 
<p>When the U.S. Constitution was being considered for adoption, many citizens recognized that the voting methods used in Congress could allow the passage of laws that infringed on these basic freedoms.&#160; For example, there were fears that if a majority of Congressmen were either Catholics or Protestants, that majority could pass laws that made it illegal to do something &#8212; such as get a divorce or recognize the Pope as a religious leader &#8212; that was important in a competing religion.&#160; In general terms many people recognized that such tyranny was possible because government decisions only required a majority of votes in Congress.</p> 
<p>To overcome this objection, political leaders promised that if the U.S. Constitution was adopted, amendments would be added quickly to protect these freedoms.&#160; The resulting ten constitutional amendments are commonly called the <i>Bill of Rights</i>.&#160; They protect specific freedoms and rights that either the kings of England had taken away, or that many people feared losing.&#160; Occasionally Congress passes laws that infringe on these rights, but the U.S. Supreme Court can declare these laws as unconstitutional.</p> 
<p>Without these constitutionally protected rights, a majority of Congressmen, with support from a President, could infringe on important rights.&#160; This tyranny can occur because a majority of Congressmen can outvote the other Congressmen.&#160; This kind of situation is called the tyranny of the majority.&#160; The Bill of Rights, as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court, is what protects citizens from such tyranny.</p> 
<h1>Room For Improvement In Voting Methods</h1> 
<p>Notice that the balance of power between Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court compensates for an unfairness in how voting is done in Congress.&#160; The writers of the U.S. Constitution also recognized that a single person as President could lead to unfair governmental actions.</p> 
<p>To prevent the worst of these unfairnesses from occurring, the Constitution basically requires governmental decisions and actions to be agreed upon between the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House of Representatives, the U.S. Supreme Court, and the President.&#160; This protection is based on the assumption that unfair and unwise actions are unlikely if so many officials in different branches of government must agree on these actions.&#160; This balance of power has been successful in preventing publicly visible, power-hungry groups of people from exploiting the unfairness that can occur in both election results and the use of majority voting in Congress.</p> 
<p>However, the unfair treatment of some citizens by other citizens continues to occur.&#160; In the days of kings and queens unfairnesses were obvious because they commonly involved physical suffering in forms such as slavery, virtual slavery, the unfair loss of life or health, and imprisonment for political reasons.&#160; At the time the U.S. Constitution was written, the most obvious issues of fairness involved taxation, religious freedom, and various kinds of slavery based on racial differences.&#160; <b>Today the unfairnesses are much less obvious because they mostly involve money and legal documents, and these abstractions are not as noticeable as physical suffering</b>.</p> 
<p>The progress of civilization during the past few centuries has been dramatic.&#160; No longer are citizens ruled by kings and queens who maintain power through military force.&#160; Now government officials are chosen through elections, and support for government decisions is based on the belief that a majority of citizens approve of these decisions.&#160; Yet there is still room for improvement in the fairness of government.&#160; This improvement will occur by adopting voting methods that are considerably fairer than the now-outdated ones adopted two centuries ago.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?</p> 
<p>Most importantly, recognize that the Electoral College has not yet been eliminated from Presidential elections because the only other alternative is plurality voting, and that method produces even worse results.</p> 
<p>Recognize that the technologies of television, telephones, automobiles, and computers have opened up new opportunities for fairer voting methods.&#160; If these technologies existed back when the U.S. Constitution was written, the writers would have chosen different voting methods.</p> 
<p>To avoid getting discouraged by what happens in politics today, appreciate the dramatic increases in fairness that have been achieved since the U.S. Constitution was written.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 4:&#160; Global Grope:&#160; How Do Other Democracies Vote?</h1> 
<p>Do other democratic countries use voting methods that are better than the ones used here in the United States?&#160; No democratic country has successfully overcome the excessive influence of campaign contributions, and the most popular foreign voting methods involve significant disadvantages that would not be tolerated in the United States.&#160; Therefore fairness cannot be improved simply by copying a foreign voting method.&#160; Yet some elements of foreign voting methods would be useful for improving U.S. voting methods, so this chapter explains how voting is done in other democratic countries.</p> 
<h1>The United States Is No Longer Alone</h1> 
<p>The United States was the first country to become a democracy.&#160; There are now more than 130 countries that are categorized as democracies.&#160; In particular, democracy is used in most of the countries in Europe, North, Central, and South America, and portions of Asia.&#160; In contrast, the areas where democracy is less common are China and the countries in Africa and the Middle East.</p> 
<p>Let's start our exploration of foreign voting methods by examining how voting is done in Germany.</p> 
<h1>Proportional Representation Chosen For Germany</h1> 
<p>At the end of World War Two, three of the four victorious countries &#8212; the United States, Britain, and France &#8212; took on the responsibility for setting up a new, democratic government for West Germany.&#160; (The fourth victorious country, the Soviet Union, was given control of East Germany.)&#160; Experts from the victorious countries worked together to design the new government.&#160; Later, when West and East Germany recombined, this system of government was extended into East Germany.</p> 
<p>There were U.S. citizens involved in the design effort, but they did not want to copy the way elections are conducted in the United States.&#160; Why?&#160; Because they recognized that our voting methods accommodate only two main political parties.&#160; They wanted to accommodate more political parties so that the political parties would be more representative of the voters' preferences.</p> 
<p>Germany's legislature is called the Bundestag.&#160; As in most democratic countries, the Bundestag consists of two houses.&#160; The following discussion about electing Bundestag members applies to members in the lower house &#8212; which corresponds to our House of Representatives &#8212; rather than members in the upper house &#8212; which corresponds to our Senate.&#160; If you are currently only familiar with U.S. voting methods, hang on for an interesting ride.</p> 
<p>Very importantly, <b>a German voter indicates on the ballot which political party he or she most prefers</b>.&#160; The ballot contains a list of political parties such as the Christian Democratic Union, Christian Social Union, Social Democratic party, Green party, Free Democratic party, and the Party of Democratic Socialism.&#160; For example, if a voter prefers the Social Democratic party, he or she marks that party as his or her preferred choice.&#160; Here is a ballot that shows what a voter sees.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_090_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 090" width="580" height="631"/></p> 
<p>Now here is the interesting part.&#160; Let's say that 36 percent of the voters mark the Social Democratic party as their preferred party.&#160; In this case, approximately 36 percent of the seats in the lower-house Bundestag are given to candidates from the Social Democratic party.&#160; If the Green party receives 7 percent of the votes, then approximately 7 percent of the seats go to Green-party candidates.&#160; And so on.&#160; If a political party is not popular enough to achieve a specified threshold, it wins no seats.</p> 
<p>In addition to voting for political parties, German voters also vote for candidates.&#160; Specifically, the voters in each district vote for one of the candidates in that district &#8212; just as we vote for a Congressman to represent each Congressional district.&#160; Whichever candidate receives the most votes from the district goes to the Bundestag to represent that district.&#160; Half the members of the Bundestag are elected in this way.</p> 
<p>The other half of the members of the Bundestag are selected so that, as already indicated, <b>the total percentage of all the candidates from one particular political party approximately equals the percentage of voters who prefer that party</b>.&#160; Therefore, in terms of political-party preferences, the members of the lower-house Bundestag match the general population of Germany.&#160; Fortunately you don't need to understand the complex rules that determine how many seats each political party gets.&#160; The results are what is important.</p> 
<p>The election of representatives in a way that matches political-party orientations of representatives with political-party orientations of voters is called <i><b>proportional representation</b></i>.&#160; It is used in many democracies, although with some variations that will be explained shortly.</p> 
<h1>Letting Parties Control Which Candidates Win</h1> 
<p>Where do the politicians come from who fill the extra Bundestag seats that are won by each political party?&#160; The politicians are candidates who didn't win their district elections.&#160; This is reasonable.&#160; But who chooses from among these candidates?&#160; <b>The leaders in each political party get to choose the order in which their politicians fill the seats won by their party</b>.&#160; This order is conveyed in something called a party list.</p> 
<p>In other words, the popularity of the political party determines how many of the politicians at the top of the party's list win seats in the Bundestag, and the political-party leaders choose the sequence of the names on the list.</p> 
<p>Not surprisingly, party leaders put at the top of their party list the politicians who are most likely to vote in the Bundestag according to what the party leaders want.&#160; As a result, politicians in each political party must be closely aligned with their political party in order to survive politically in Germany.</p> 
<p>Basically the leaders of the political parties act as intermediate voters in the selection of half the members of the lower house of the Bundestag.&#160; This involvement of intermediate voters produces <b>un</b>representative results.&#160; Keep in mind that German political parties, just as the ones in the United States, are funded by special interests.&#160; Therefore the party leaders, under the influence of funding, place at the top of the list the politicians who are most likely to implement the special agendas of the biggest campaign contributors.</p> 
<h1>Closed And Open Party Lists</h1> 
<p>Some other countries that use proportional representation have attempted to overcome the unfairness of letting party leaders choose the sequence of the party list.</p> 
<p>The German technique just explained is called the closed party list.&#160; The alternate approach is called the open party list.&#160; The open party list allows the voters to vote in a way that determines the order in which candidates are chosen to fill the extra seats won by each party.</p> 
<p>Among the countries that use proportional representation, the open party list is used in fewer countries than closed party lists.&#160; Why?&#160; One of the reasons is that the politicians who are in power at the time proportional representation is adopted know that they, as senior politicians, will be at the top of the closed party list.&#160; In contrast, these politicians know that if the open party list approach is chosen, their seniority will be irrelevant in the upcoming elections.</p> 
<p>Now let's get back to the way Germans elect Bundestag representatives.</p> 
<h1>Too Many Parties?</h1> 
<p>The voting method used to elect lower-house Bundestag representatives allows more than two political parties to form.&#160; Is this good?&#160; It is what the designers of the system wanted to achieve.&#160; But does the outcome produce the kind of government voters want?</p> 
<p>You probably noticed the word <i>Christian</i> in the names of two of the German political parties.&#160; As you would expect, the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union are political parties based on religious orientations.</p> 
<p>In Germany the breakdown of political parties according to religious groups has not been a significant problem.&#160; In contrast, the much higher religious diversity of the United States would lead to dramatic problems if U.S. political parties were based on religious orientations.</p> 
<h1>Coalition Tradition</h1> 
<p>A big disadvantage of having more than two political parties in the Bundestag is that coalitions are needed to pass new legislation.&#160; The need for coalitions arises because at least half the representatives, plus one, must vote in favor of a new law to get it passed.&#160; Yet in a country that accommodates more than two political parties, it is uncommon for any one political party to constitute a majority.</p> 
<p>A coalition is an agreement between political parties to cooperate with each other so that each of the political parties in the coalition can get what it wants.&#160; For example, the Christian Democratic Union and the Christian Social Union typically work together to pass laws that Christians want.&#160; Neither of these political parties constitutes a majority, but together they have, in the past, outnumbered the Social Democratic party, which has otherwise been the most popular party.</p> 
<p>What is wrong with coalitions?&#160; From a voter's point of view, a coalition may not represent what the voter prefers.&#160; For example, if a German voter indicates the Green party as her preferred political party, she has no control over whether the Green party forms a coalition with the Social Democratic party or one of the Christian parties.&#160; In reality she probably knows from listening to the news which parties form alliances and coalitions, so there are usually no surprises.&#160; Nevertheless, she is not allowed to directly indicate her religious and social preferences if she chooses a party based on her environmental preferences.</p> 
<p>In the United States, the existence of only two main political parties eliminates the need to establish coalitions.&#160; As a minor exception, when one of the members of the House of Representatives is an independent, that Representative often forms an informal coalition with one of the two main parties.&#160; The absence of coalitions in Congress means that voters don't have to be concerned about Congressmen reorganizing themselves, in unexpected ways, to achieve a majority.</p> 
<p>Political scientists have analyzed the number of political parties in each country.&#160; The numbers range from two political parties in plurality countries such as the United States, to about five political parties in Switzerland, Finland, Italy, and Papua New Guinea.&#160; On average, there are two political parties in plurality systems, effectively 2.8 (almost three) political parties in majority systems, and effectively 3.6 (between three and four) political parties in systems using proportional representation.&#160; (The reason for the fractional numbers in counting political parties is that a small party that represents, say, ten percent of the voters is too large to be ignored, yet too small to be counted the same as a large political party.)&#160; These numbers clearly reveal that, as intended, proportional representation accommodates more political parties.</p> 
<p>Forming a coalition involves backroom negotiations.&#160; In these negotiations the coalition parties reach agreements about which agendas of which parties will be neglected, and which other agendas will be mutually supported.&#160; The resulting compromises inevitably betray some voters.&#160; This betrayal occurs when a voter has voted for a particular party because of an agenda that the coalition chooses to neglect.</p> 
<p>Perhaps the ultimate unfairness of coalitions is that the backroom coalition deals are arranged by a few powerful politicians, not by all the politicians who have been elected in the parties.&#160; As a result, the agenda of the coalition is not necessarily representative of what is wanted by a majority of the politicians who the voters elected.&#160; In other words, the use of coalitions introduces yet another level of taking political decisions out of the hands of voters.</p> 
<h1>Various Variations</h1> 
<p>The countries that use proportional representation do not all use the same methods.&#160; What are some of the variations between countries that use proportional representation?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A key difference among countries using proportional representation is the method of calculating how many seats each party wins.&#160; These methods, which involve complex calculations that you don't need to know about, have names such as D'Hondt, Hare, and Droop.&#160; (Really!)&#160; Some of these calculation methods give slightly more seats to smaller parties whereas others slightly favor larger parties.</li> 
<li>Different countries use different thresholds that specify how popular a party has to be in order to win a legislative seat.</li> 
<li>In some countries, including Germany, proportional representation is used to elect only some of the legislative members.&#160; The other members are elected using traditional plurality or majority voting methods.&#160; Some countries use proportional representation to elect all the representatives.</li> 
<li>Israel and the Netherlands have no districts and instead the entire country is treated as a single voting unit.&#160; Other countries have districts, and voting within a district identifies the winner in each district.</li> 
<li>Among countries that use districts, some countries have two or three tiers of districts.&#160; This approach can be thought of as involving some small districts, some intermediate-sized districts that include the small districts, and a nationwide grouping.&#160; As an example, Germany uses two tiers: the districts from which some of the representatives are elected (some by proportional representation and some by plurality voting), and a single nationwide grouping from which other representatives are elected.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There is no single most popular arrangement for how proportional representation is implemented.&#160; Each variation has advantages and disadvantages.&#160; The variations have been analyzed in detail and there have been many debates about which is best.&#160; Ultimately, the fact that there is no agreement about which is best reveals the underlying truth: none of them provides completely fair results.</p> 
<h1>Why Is Proportional Representation So Popular?</h1> 
<p>Variations of proportional representation are now used in at least 35 countries, including most European countries, New Zealand, Mexico, and some South American and Asian countries.&#160; In contrast, fewer than 20 countries do not use proportional representation.&#160; These non-users notably include Britain and its former colonies of the United States, Canada, India, and Pakistan.</p> 
<p>Why is proportional representation so popular?&#160; Because it provides these benefits.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Proportional representation accommodates more than two political parties.</li> 
<li>Proportional representation ensures that the number of seats won by each political party matches the popularity of the party.&#160; By comparison, in the United States the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats in Congress does not necessarily match the balance of popularity for these two political parties.</li> 
<li>Proportional representation eliminates the problem of gerrymandering (which is described in Chapter 9).&#160; This means that manipulating district boundaries does not change the number of legislative seats won by each political party.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In addition to these advantages, proportional representation also has significant disadvantages.</p> 
<h1>Dark Side Of Proportional Representation</h1> 
<p>In spite of its advantages, proportional representation has not eliminated, or even significantly reduced, the excessive influence of campaign contributions.&#160; The outcome of elections involving proportional representation is easily manipulated by money.&#160; In some ways this monetary influence is easier to achieve through proportional representation than through U.S. voting methods.</p> 
<p>In countries that use closed party lists, financial influence is especially strong because political parties choose to put at the top of their party list the politicians who are most likely to follow the money-influenced party agenda.</p> 
<p>In countries that use open party lists, financial influence is still strong because plurality voting, which is vulnerable to manipulation, is used to determine the popularity of politicians in open party lists.</p> 
<p>The biggest unfairness of proportional representation arises because politicians are dependent upon their political party to win a seat in parliament.&#160; Political parties are easily influenced by campaign contributions, so this financial influence, combined with the dependence on party politics, leads to politicians being heavily influenced by money.</p> 
<p>An important limitation of proportional representation is that <b>proportional representation can only be used to elect members of a legislature.&#160; This means proportional representation cannot be used to elect Mayors and Presidents</b>.&#160; After all, it is impossible to choose a President who is, say, 40 percent Republican, 35 percent Democratic, and 25 percent Green.</p> 
<p>Countries that use proportional representation elect Mayors and other single-seat officials using basically the same methods as in the United States.&#160; However, the executive leaders of many countries that use proportional representation are elected differently using methods that will be explained shortly.&#160; But first let's wrap up the explanation of proportional representation.</p> 
<h1>Upper House Too?</h1> 
<p>An understanding of proportional representation would not be complete without understanding the concept of houses.&#160; Many countries, including the United States, Canada, and Germany, have a legislature that consists of both an upper and lower house.&#160; (Scrabble players will want to know that this kind of legislature is called <i>bicameral</i>.)&#160; Other countries have a legislature that consists of just a single house.&#160; (Another scrabble word: <i>unicameral</i>.)</p> 
<p>Most of the countries that have two houses and also use proportional representation only use proportional representation to elect the members of the lower house.&#160; In other words, proportional representation is not normally used to elect the members of the upper house.</p> 
<p>In many countries the members of the upper house are directly elected by the voters using traditional plurality or majority voting methods.&#160; However, in some countries, including Canada, Britain, and Germany, the members of the upper house are not directly elected by the voters.&#160; In such cases, who chooses these members?&#160; Here are some variations used in various countries.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The lower house elects the members of the upper house.</li> 
<li>Provinces (which are equivalent to states in the United States) are each governed by a provincial legislature and these legislatures elect the members of the upper house.&#160; Note that this is the method that was originally used in the United States until the Seventeenth Amendment was adopted.</li> 
<li>Some or all of the seats in the upper house are inherited.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These variations reveal that in many countries there is still considerable room for improvement in how the members of the upper house are elected.&#160; They also reveal that democratic forms of government are still evolving.</p> 
<p>What's the functional difference between an upper house and a lower house?&#160; Traditionally the upper house has more control over financial matters, especially budgets.</p> 
<p>Where did these house-related differences come from?&#160; Back in the late 1200s, King Edward the First of England established a Parliament.&#160; His subjects wanted it and he realized that a Parliament would make it easier to raise money to pay for wars (against France, Wales, and Scotland) and he figured it would help him influence public opinion.&#160; The members of the upper house of Parliament were upper-class citizens such as lords and barons.&#160; In contrast, the members of the lower house were knights, landowners, and other middle-class people.&#160; (Back then, laborers, servants, and other lower-class citizens were not intended to be represented in either house.)&#160; The upper house got the role of raising money because these members of the nobility represented the people who had money.&#160; The upper-house members were not elected because they had to be representative of the richest and most powerful people in their region, which meant they were chosen by their region's richest and most powerful people.</p> 
<h1>President Or Prime Minister?</h1> 
<p>Democratic systems of government around the world are commonly classified into two categories: presidential and parliamentary.&#160; In a presidential democracy a single person called a President makes all the executive decisions.&#160; In a parliamentary democracy a group of cabinet ministers, who are collectively known as the Cabinet, make all the executive decisions.&#160; Within a parliamentary Cabinet, one of the ministers, who is known as the Prime Minister, has the most influence in Cabinet decisions.&#160; This means the Prime Minister is the most powerful leader of a parliamentary democracy.</p> 
<p>The United States, France, Costa Rica, Colombia, and Venezuela are the only countries in which the country's most powerful leader is a President.&#160; A few other countries, including Iceland, Portugal, and Austria, have a President, but they also have a Prime Minister (or equivalent) who is more powerful.</p> 
<p>All the countries that have someone functioning as a President use the title of President for that office.&#160; Most countries that have a Prime Minister use the title of Prime Minister for the office, but there are exceptions such as Germany's Chancellor.&#160; Confusingly, Botswana's leader is functionally a Prime Minister, but is given the title of President.</p> 
<p>What's the difference between a President and a Prime Minister?&#160; The most surprising difference is that <b>a Prime Minister is elected by Parliament, which means he or she is not directly elected by citizens</b>.&#160; Another important difference is that <b>a Prime Minister, unlike a President, cannot ignore the political opinions of cabinet members</b>.&#160; Let's explore these differences in the next few sections.</p> 
<h1>Evolution Of Selection</h1> 
<p>The parliamentary system of government developed in England where originally all the executive decisions were made by the hereditary king (or queen).&#160; The representatives in Parliament controlled the flow of tax money to the king and set some limits on how the money could be used.&#160; In the mid-1300s the lower house of English Parliament began electing a <i>common speaker</i> as a representative of Parliament to meet with the king.</p> 
<p>Over the next few centuries, kings increasingly depended on advisers to persuade members of Parliament to support what the king wanted.&#160; Eventually these advisers evolved into a Cabinet consisting of cabinet ministers.&#160; Originally cabinet ministers were chosen by the king.&#160; Later Parliament was allowed to approve the appointment of cabinet ministers because someone who the Parliament members disliked was not able to accomplish much.&#160; Not surprisingly members of Parliament did not like cabinet ministers who were outsiders, so English kings increasingly chose their cabinet ministers from among the members of Parliament.</p> 
<p>During much of the 1700s England was ruled by King George the First and his son King George the Second.&#160; They preferred not to meet with Parliament, so they began the tradition of primarily meeting with the Cabinet.&#160; In addition, these two kings came to depend on an adviser named Sir Robert Walpole.&#160; Walpole's advice was regularly approved by these two kings, and Walpole was able to get political support from Parliament, so his political changes brought political stability and economic prosperity to England.&#160; This arrangement worked so well that later kings continued the position.&#160; Eventually the person in this position came to be known as the Prime Minister.</p> 
<p>By the 1700s Parliament had become predictable regarding its choice of common speaker.&#160; The majority party leader (the leader of whichever political party comprised a majority) nearly always became the common speaker.&#160; Parliament had to approve the king's choice of Prime Minister, and not surprisingly approval was usually withheld for anyone other than the majority party leader, so typically the king was forced to choose the majority party leader as the Prime Minister.</p> 
<p>The parliamentary form of government used in England was very successful, so other countries copied it.&#160; Today in each parliamentary democracy, regardless of whether a ceremonial king or queen is involved, the Prime Minister is chosen by Parliament.&#160; Notice that the most powerful leader of a parliamentary democracy is not directly elected by the country's citizens.</p> 
<p>To appreciate what this means, imagine allowing the United States Congress to elect the President of the United States.&#160; That's basically what happens in parliamentary democracies.&#160; Obviously the people of the United States will never adopt the parliamentary form of government.</p> 
<p>There is another important difference between parliamentary and presidential democracies.&#160; If a Parliament does not like what the cabinet ministers and Prime Minister do, Parliament can, with a simple majority, pass a vote of no confidence and thereby dissolve the Cabinet and the choice of Prime Minister.&#160; In the United States this capability would be equivalent to Congress voting the President out of office.&#160; The power of Congress to impeach the President may seem similar, but impeachment must be based on the President committing a crime and the voting requires a two-thirds majority to pass.</p> 
<p>The flip side of the no-confidence vote is that, in some countries, a Prime Minister and Cabinet can request new elections for all the members of Parliament.&#160; This control is a carryover from the days when kings could dismiss Parliament.&#160; Back then the motivation for a king to bring back Parliament was that Parliament was in charge of raising money to pay for government, so without Parliament the king had no money to pay for wars, luxuries, and necessities.&#160; It is uncommon for a Prime Minister and Cabinet to request new elections because they, as members of Parliament, also must run for reelection and the new members of Parliament may not choose the same cabinet ministers and the same Prime Minister.</p> 
<h1>Parliamentary Party Balancing</h1> 
<p>You now understand that in parliamentary governments the chief executive is elected by Parliament, not by citizens.&#160; Yet citizen preferences are involved because the number of parliamentary members from each political party is directly affected by the vote of citizens.&#160; Specifically, if a majority of citizens prefer a particular political party, that party usually wins a majority of seats in Parliament, which leads to that party's leader becoming the Prime Minister.&#160; This is why proportional representation is especially popular in parliamentary governments.</p> 
<p>What happens if none of the political parties has a majority in Parliament?&#160; As explained earlier, the most powerful members of Parliament meet in closed sessions to form a ruling coalition.&#160; Although one of the possible points of negotiation in forming a ruling coalition is who will be the Prime Minister, the leader of the largest party in the coalition is usually chosen as Prime Minister.&#160; Once the ruling coalition has been formed, Parliament votes for Prime Minister.&#160; Assuming the coalition does not immediately break down, a majority of Parliament members elect the coalition's choice for Prime Minister.</p> 
<p>Is it fair to allow Parliament to choose the chief executive, instead of allowing citizens to elect this person?&#160; The fairness depends on how elections are conducted.&#160; Both parliamentary and presidential systems of government use unfair voting methods, so both approaches involve unfairness.</p> 
<p>The matching of political parties between Parliament and the Prime Minister allows a parliamentary government to govern in a more coordinated way.&#160; Without this coordination the arrangement is similar to what happens in the United States when the President is not from the same political party as the majority party in Congress.&#160; In particular, a party-based mismatch between the legislative and executive branches of government makes it difficult for the legislature (Parliament or Congress) to pass laws that will be enforced by the chief executive (Prime Minister or President).</p> 
<p>More will be explained about the issue of party balancing in Chapter 9.&#160; For now, recognize that most citizens of parliamentary countries regard the political-party match between Parliament and Prime Minister as an advantage.&#160; It is seen as fair because citizens get to determine the balance of power between political parties in Parliament.&#160; Parliament is limited to the less-important decision of which parliamentary member from that party should be chosen as the Prime Minister.</p> 
<p>To better understand this issue of fairness, consider that most U.S. citizens are very concerned about whether a President is a Republican or Democrat.&#160; Once that decision is made, the choice of which Republican or which Democrat becomes President is much less important.</p> 
<h1>Cabinet Selection</h1> 
<p>In a parliamentary system of government, <b>cabinet ministers are elected by the members of Parliament</b>.&#160; If there is a majority party, most (or all) of the cabinet ministers come from the majority party.&#160; If a coalition is needed to form a majority in Parliament, the cabinet ministers are usually members of the political parties that form the coalition.&#160; Typically these coalition-based cabinet assignments are arranged in advance during the negotiations that form the ruling coalition.&#160; Some parliamentary countries have special rules that require the cabinet to include members from more than just one or two political parties because this forces Parliament to improve the representation of less-popular political parties.</p> 
<p>In some parliamentary systems, the Prime Minister is simply one of the cabinet ministers and has no more authority than the other cabinet ministers.&#160; In other parliamentary systems, the Prime Minister has more authority.</p> 
<p>In virtually all parliamentary systems, the Prime Minister cannot act without approval from at least a majority of the cabinet ministers.&#160; This approach is very different from the presidential system in which the cabinet members are simply advisers to the President, and the President is free to ignore their advice.&#160; In parliamentary systems, cabinet ministers and the Prime Minister rule together as a team.&#160; As such, the Prime Minister cannot make important decisions alone.</p> 
<p>When summit meetings occur between countries, Prime Ministers and Presidents are the officials who participate in these meetings.&#160; Such high-level meetings can give the false impression that Prime Ministers are as powerful as Presidents.&#160; At the summit meeting a Prime Minister knows that anything he or she agrees to must be approved of by most of the cabinet ministers in addition to being approved by Parliament.&#160; In contrast, a President knows that anything he or she agrees to only needs to be approved by the national legislature.</p> 
<h1>Parliamentary Flaws</h1> 
<p>Parliamentary systems of government have not been more successful than presidential systems in avoiding the excessive influence of campaign contributions.&#160; Just as in presidential systems, parliamentary systems lead to governmental actions that frequently do not match the desires of a majority of voters.</p> 
<p>There are a number of reasons for the gap between what voters want and what parliamentary politicians do.&#160; A large gap occurs because the members of Parliament, not the citizens, are the people who choose the Prime Minister.&#160; A larger gap occurs because the use of party lists gives extra power to the leaders of the political parties, and this arrangement isolates the members of Parliament from the voters.</p> 
<p>The use of coalitions involves another level of isolation between politicians and voters because <b>coalitions are formed without the direct involvement of voters</b>.&#160; Consider that when a political party joins a coalition the party may choose to abandon some agendas that are the most important ones to many of the voters who marked that party as their favorite.&#160; From another perspective, coalitions are like giant political parties composed of smaller political parties, but these giant parties are created in backroom negotiations that occur after the election.&#160; In these negotiations citizen voters are not involved.&#160; In contrast, political-party leaders are fully involved, and these leaders are heavily influenced by the biggest campaign contributors.</p> 
<h1>Better Ballots In Ireland, Australia, And Cambridge</h1> 
<p><b>There are a few countries in which the voters are allowed to indicate on a ballot not only their first choice, but also their second choice, third choice, and so on</b>.&#160; In the elections where they are currently used, this kind of voting is called preferential voting.&#160; <b>The ballots in these elections are called preference ballots</b>.</p> 
<p><b>In most other elections throughout the world, voters are only allowed to mark each race with a single mark, even when there are more than two choices in the race</b>.&#160; Ironically <b>such ballots</b> are so dominant that they don't have a name.&#160; So in this book they <b>are called single-mark ballots</b>.</p> 
<p>Where are preference ballots used?&#160; In the United States they are used in Cambridge Massachusetts to elect city-council members and school-committee members.&#160; Preference ballots are used in Ireland to elect its President and to elect members of Parliament.&#160; And preference ballots are used to elect members of Parliament in these countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Netherlands, and Poland.</p> 
<p>Which voting methods use preference ballots?&#160; The following three methods, which differ according to how they determine who wins an election.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Instant-runoff voting (IRV), which in other countries is called alternative voting, and which is sometimes called majority-preferential voting.&#160; This method is used in Ireland to elect its President.</li> 
<li>Single transferable vote (STV), which is sometimes called choice voting.&#160; This method is used in Cambridge Massachusetts, and it is used in both Australia and Ireland to elect the members of the lower house of Parliament.</li> 
<li>Proportional representation (PR) that uses a preferential list.&#160; This method is used to elect members of the lower house of Parliament in Belgium, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Netherlands, and Poland.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In this chapter you learned about the unfair aspects of proportional representation.&#160; For reasons you will learn about in Chapter 6, instant-runoff voting and the single transferable vote also fail to produce fair election results in many common situations.&#160; The failure of these three voting methods to produce fair results has limited the popularity of using preference ballots.</p> 
<p>The use of preference ballots should not be misinterpreted as causing unfair results.&#160; Instead remember that it's how the ballot preferences are translated into results that accounts for the unfairness.&#160; This distinction is important because <b>in the future every election in every truly democratic country will allow voters to indicate not only their first choice, but also their second choice, third choice, and so on</b>.&#160; The people living at that future time will regard the single-mark ballots we use today as primitive.</p> 
<h1>Election-Day Turnout</h1> 
<p>How does voter turnout in the United States compare with the voter turnout in other countries?&#160; Embarrassingly low.&#160; Most other democracies have significantly higher percentages of eligible voters who vote.</p> 
<p>A few countries charge a monetary fine when an eligible voter does not vote, so of course these countries have increased voter turnout.&#160; And there are a few so-called democracies in which threats of violence are used to discourage voting.&#160; Aside from these unusual situations, what affects voter turnout?</p> 
<p><b>What affects voter turnout the most is the degree to which voting makes a difference in election results</b>.</p> 
<p>Whenever a nation first becomes democratic, voter turnout is usually very high.&#160; Then, after a number of election cycles, voter turnout decreases.&#160; The initially high turnout reflects the optimism of citizens finally being allowed to choose their leaders.&#160; The later decrease occurs because the elected politicians usually fail to accomplish what the citizens wanted, and the citizens become discouraged by the choices on the ballot.</p> 
<p>The democratic nations that use proportional representation typically have a significantly higher voter turnout compared to voter turnout in the United States.&#160; This occurs because nearly every vote makes a difference in the results, at least in terms of how many seats each political party wins.&#160; By contrast, there are many elections in the United States where the election results are so easily predicted that even a significant increase in voter turnout cannot change the results.</p> 
<p>In elections where voter turnout can make a difference, the people who choose not to vote are basically conveying the message that they approve of the <i>choices</i> made by the people who do vote.&#160; This does not mean that non-voters approve of the <i>politicians</i> who win the elections.&#160; It means that, in the opinion of most non-voters, none of the other politicians listed on the ballot are significantly better than the likely winner.</p> 
<p>In all countries there are many people who vote on a regular basis even when campaign contributors have basically pre-selected the candidates whose names appear on the ballot.&#160; These voters know that they are imposing at least a little influence on the results.&#160; Some of them get added satisfaction by knowing that if they didn't vote, then influence in government decisions would cost less money than it now does.</p> 
<h1>Evolution Of Voting</h1> 
<p>Now that you understand that other countries do not have better voting methods, let's take a moment to consider how voting methods are continuing to evolve.</p> 
<p>Each time governmental unfairness becomes intolerable, voting improvements are made.&#160; You have seen the basic pattern of government being taken out of the hands of kings and queens who never come up for election, followed by citizens electing people who in turn elect other people who control government.&#160; Obviously the evolutionary path is leading us toward a time in the future when citizens will directly elect the most powerful government officials in ways that produce dramatically fairer results.</p> 
<p>Currently every country conducts direct and indirect elections using unfair voting methods.&#160; You will learn in Part Two that the basis of these unfair methods is the use of single-mark ballots combined with the former absence of a fair way to use all the preferences of all the voters.&#160; Also in Part Two you will learn that the failure to collect secondary preferences leads to needing intermediate voters and political-party leaders to be involved in the election process.&#160; This involvement of extra people between voters and politicians makes it easy for election results to be influenced by campaign contributions.</p> 
<p>Fortunately there is now a way to get fair results using recently available computers and recently developed voting methods.&#160; These much fairer voting methods are described in Part Three.</p> 
<p>Civilization has evolved through primitive voting methods that were necessary because of limitations in transportation, communication, and computation.&#160; In parallel with that evolution, big improvements have been made in terms of allowing women and minorities to vote, correctly counting all the votes, and increasingly eliminating outright corruption of the election process.</p> 
<p>Now civilization is ready for the next step in making democracy truly democratic.&#160; Computers are now available to process all the preferences of all the voters in a way that produces fair results.&#160; In ways that are explained in the book's closing chapter, the much fairer results will take civilization to the next levels of economic prosperity, more peaceful international affairs, and effective solutions to the many big problems that most voters want elected politicians to solve.</p> 

<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; You can read news reports about political events in other countries.&#160; When you read these reports, notice that other countries are struggling with the same kinds of election concerns that we encounter here in the United States.&#160; Also notice references to majority parties, ruling coalitions, and the Prime Minister's party.&#160; (Another term is an opposition party, which is a party that is not in the ruling coalition.)</p> 
<p>To gain a clearer perspective of the United States, read (or listen to) news reports from other countries regarding what goes on in the United States.&#160; Examples of such news include BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) news (BBC.com), and foreign opinions presented in some news sources such as <i>The Week</i> magazine (TheWeek.com).</p> 

<h1>Part Two:&#160; Why Election Results Are Now So Easy To Manipulate</h1> 

<h1>Chapter 5:&#160; Ignorance Is Amiss:&#160; Why Plurality Voting Makes Results Easy To Manipulate</h1> 
<p>Most primary and general elections throughout the United States use plurality voting even though it easily produces unfair results.&#160; In this chapter you will learn how the biggest campaign contributors exploit the unfairness to manipulate the results of plurality-based elections, especially primary elections.</p> 
<h1>Plurality Voting Is Almost Everywhere</h1> 
<p>What is plurality voting?&#160; In this method of voting the candidate who gets the most votes wins.&#160; It's that simple.&#160; The wording in laws that implement plurality voting state that the candidate who receives the <i>most votes</i> or the <i>largest number of votes</i> wins the election.</p> 
<p>Nearly all the primary and general elections throughout the United States use plurality voting.&#160; The only notable exception is Presidential elections.&#160; This means that plurality voting is used to elect Congressmen, state Governors, state legislators, city Mayors, and city-council members.&#160; Plurality voting was even used in the 2003 California recall election in which the ballot listed the names of 135 candidates competing to become the Governor of California.</p> 
<p>The use of plurality voting in primary elections is especially unfair.&#160; Why?&#160; Because primary elections can involve more than two main candidates, and increasing the number of candidates increases the unfairness.&#160; When an important primary election has only two candidates, very likely there are additional people who would like to compete for the elected position, but they are encouraged not to run because entering the race will cause the wrong candidate to win.</p> 
<h1>Superficial Simplicity Of Plurality</h1> 
<p>Plurality voting is simple to describe, and calculating the results is also simple.&#160; Yet complexities arise.</p> 
<p>From your perspective as a voter, you know that complexities arise in choosing how to mark a ballot when there are more than two choices.&#160; From the perspective of politicians, complexities arise in deciding whether to enter a race.&#160; From the perspective of campaign contributors, complexities arise in choosing which candidates to support with campaign contributions.</p> 
<h1>Two-Choice General Elections</h1> 
<p>To better understand the subtle complexities of plurality voting, let's consider an example.&#160; Let's suppose there is a general election in which Gordon and Shannon are competing for the office of Congressional Representative.&#160; Notice there are only two choices in this race.</p> 
<p>Here is what the single-mark ballot in this election would look like.&#160; It has been marked by a voter who prefers Shannon.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_114_fig_2.png" alt="Figure 2 on page 114" width="580" height="360"/></p> 
<p>To keep the numbers simple, let's suppose there are only 100 voters in the voting district.&#160; Out of these 100 voters, suppose that 40 voters prefer Gordon and 60 voters prefer Shannon.&#160; The next illustration represents this simple situation.&#160; (If you don't like numbers, just look at the illustrations because they provide the same information.)</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_115_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 115" width="580" height="708"/></p> 
<p>This illustration makes it clear that more voters prefer Shannon compared to Gordon, so according to the rules of plurality voting, Shannon wins the election.&#160; Also notice that more than half the voters &#8212; a majority &#8212; prefer Shannon.&#160; Soon you will learn why getting a majority of votes is important for fairness.</p> 
<p><b>As long as there are only two candidates in a race, plurality voting produces fair results</b>.&#160; This situation exists in most U.S. general elections because general elections normally involve just one Republican candidate and just one Democratic candidate.&#160; Each of the two main parties allows only one of their candidates on the ballot.&#160; This two-choice situation leads to one or the other of the two candidates receiving not only a plurality of votes, but a majority of votes as well.</p> 
<p>Of course most general elections also involve third-party candidates.&#160; Usually these third-party candidates get so few votes that the results are not affected, although there are occasional exceptions.&#160; It happened in Minnesota when voters elected a Governor named Jesse Ventura who was an independent (nonpartisan) candidate.&#160; But such exceptions are relatively rare.&#160; As long as a general election involves only two main candidates, plurality voting works fine and it produces fair results.</p> 
<h1>Unfairness Of Just Getting A Plurality</h1> 
<p>Now let's turn back the clock and look at the primary election that Gordon won in order to get to the general election we just considered.&#160; In this primary election let's suppose that Gordon is competing against Clifford and Kimberly.</p> 
<p>Here is what the ballot in this election would look like.&#160; Notice that a voter can mark only one candidate's name.&#160; There is no way to indicate any difference in preference for the other two candidates.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_116_fig_2.png" alt="Figure 2 on page 116" width="580" height="436"/></p> 
<p>To keep the numbers simple, let's suppose there are 100 voters in this party's primary election.&#160; (In reality there would be about half as many voters because this primary election involves only the voters registered in one of the two main parties.)&#160; Out of the 100 voters, suppose 40 voters prefer Gordon, 30 voters prefer Clifford, and 30 voters prefer Kimberly.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_117_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 117" width="580" height="705"/></p> 
<p>In this case Gordon would win the election because he receives more votes than either of the other candidates.&#160; On the surface this outcome seems to make sense.&#160; But notice that in this case the winning candidate does not receive a majority (more than half) of the votes.&#160; To understand what's going on, let's look beneath the votes to determine the actual voter preferences.</p> 
<p>Suppose Clifford and Kimberly have very similar political views.&#160; It is very likely that the people who voted for one of them would prefer the other similar candidate rather than Gordon.&#160; This means that the 30 voters who voted for Clifford plus the 30 voters who voted for Kimberly prefer either Clifford or Kimberly rather than Gordon.</p> 
<p>To see this more clearly, suppose Clifford had not entered the race.&#160; In that case Kimberly would have received 60 votes, which indicates a much greater popularity than Gordon who gets 40 votes.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_118_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 118" width="580" height="581"/></p> 
<p>Alternatively, if Kimberly had not entered the race, Clifford would have been the clear favorite with 60 votes.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_119_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 119" width="580" height="581"/></p> 
<p>In other words, 60 out of 100 voters &#8212; which is a clear majority &#8212; do <b>not</b> want Gordon to win.&#160; Those 60 voters prefer either Clifford or Kimberly.&#160; Yet plurality voting allows the least-popular candidate to win simply because a majority of voters are split in their support for Clifford and Kimberly.</p> 
<p>Now you can appreciate why receiving a majority of the votes is so important.&#160; <b>Receiving a majority of votes means that regardless of which other candidates are in the race, and regardless of how the voters spread their votes among these other candidates, the candidate who receives the majority of votes deserves to win</b>.</p> 
<p>If all the voters who prefer either Clifford or Kimberly could agree to vote for just one candidate or the other, then the less-desirable candidate, Gordon, could be defeated.&#160; However human nature makes this kind of coordinated effort unlikely.&#160; Relatively few voters would be willing to compromise by voting for their second choice, even if that strategy would succeed in defeating their least-preferred candidate.&#160; Instead it's natural for voters to want to indicate their actual preference.</p> 
<p>From a naive perspective, this situation of splitting the vote would just happen to occur by chance.&#160; In the real world where the drive for political power frequently involves less-than-ethical behavior, splitting the vote can be done intentionally for the purpose of manipulating the outcome.</p> 
<p>Now that you understand the difference between requiring a majority and requiring a plurality, you can understand the unfairness that frequently occurs in primary elections.&#160; The unfairness occurs because the candidate who is most acceptable to all the voters &#8212; such as either Clifford or Kimberly in the example &#8212; may not receive as many votes as another candidate &#8212; such as Gordon &#8212; who appears to be more popular when only the voters' first preferences are considered.</p> 
<p>What else can be learned from this example?&#160; <b>If there are more than two candidates in a race, and none of them receives a majority of votes, and voters are only allowed to indicate their first choice, it is not possible to know which candidate is truly the most popular</b>.</p> 
<p>As a real-life example of vote splitting in a governmental election, the 2010 Hawaii First Congressional District special election had two popular Democratic candidates, Colleen Hanabusa and Ed Case, who split the votes of voters who preferred Democratic candidates.&#160; That splitting allowed the single popular Republican candidate, Charles Djou, to win easily.&#160; Specifically the majority of voters (59 percent) split their vote between the two popular Democratic candidates (with Hanabusa getting 31 percent, Case getting 28 percent, and the remaining votes going to unpopular candidates).&#160; The winner received less than half the votes (39 percent), which means that more than half the voters clearly opposed the winner.</p> 
<p>An even clearer example of vote splitting occurred when the cities of Fort William and Port Arthur in the Ontario province of Canada merged.&#160; The referendum ballot listed three proposed names: <i>Lakehead</i>, <i>The Lakehead</i>, and <i>Thunder Bay</i>.&#160; Of course the merged city was named <i>Thunder Bay</i> even though more than half the voters (60 percent) wanted either <i>Lakehead</i> or <i>The Lakehead</i>.</p> 
<p>At this point it becomes obvious what it takes to get fair results in an election when there are more than two candidates.&#160; Obviously voters must be allowed to indicate not only their first choice, but also their second choice, third choice, and so on.&#160; This is the approach recommended in Chapter 11.&#160; Such ballots are called ranked ballots.</p> 
<h1>Intentionally Splitting The Vote</h1> 
<p>How can money be used to influence the outcome of plurality voting?&#160; The most common tactic is both deceptive and effective.</p> 
<p>In the contest between Gordon, Clifford, and Kimberly, suppose Kimberly is more popular than Clifford, but together they still have 60 votes.&#160; Specifically let's assume Gordon still has 40 votes, Clifford now has 10 votes, and Kimberly now has 50 votes.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_121_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 121" width="580" height="705"/></p> 
<p>With these votes Kimberly would win the election because she receives more votes than either of the other candidates.&#160; This outcome would be fairer than the original outcome because the voters whose first choice is Clifford prefer Kimberly over Gordon.&#160; (Remember that Gordon has significantly different political views compared to the other two candidates.)</p> 
<p>Now let's turn back the clock to an earlier point in the primary election.&#160; Suppose that someone who provides financial backing to Gordon recognizes that the outcome just described is likely.&#160; This financial backer can increase the likelihood of Gordon winning the election by also contributing money to Clifford.&#160; For reasons explained in the first two chapters, the extra money would allow Clifford to increase his popularity.&#160; This popularity increase would occur at the expense of Kimberly because Clifford and Kimberly have similar political views.&#160; The result is that Gordon could win the election as described in the original scenario, where Clifford and Kimberly each receive 30 votes and Gordon receives 40 votes.</p> 
<p>As you can see, the goal of this manipulation technique is to split the votes.&#160; Specifically, the goal is to cause Kimberly to receive fewer votes by increasing the popularity of the most similar candidate, Clifford.&#160; This situation is so common that the name <i><b>spoiler</b></i> is used to refer to the candidate &#8212; Clifford &#8212; who some people would regard as spoiling the race for the similar candidate, Kimberly.</p> 
<p>Another way to view this situation is to consider that Gordon would easily lose if the spoiler, Clifford, dropped out of the race.&#160; Giving campaign contributions to the spoiler reduces the likelihood of the spoiler dropping out.</p> 
<p>In addition to being effective, this vote-splitting technique is also deceptive.&#160; Notice that the person who provides the money to the spoiler does not need to ask the spoiler for cooperation.&#160; Also, the source of this money is intentionally hidden so that the spoiler does not know the true purpose of the campaign contributions.</p> 
<p>A variation of this technique can be used when there isn't already a candidate similar to the one a group wants to defeat.&#160; In this case someone who wasn't intending to enter the race is encouraged and offered financial support.&#160; Of course the person is selected as being similar to the candidate the group wants to defeat, and the person being encouraged to enter the race does not know the reason for the encouragement and financial support.&#160; On the surface the encouragement sounds logical.&#160; For instance, perhaps the candidate is told &#8220;Lots of voters want the funding of a new convention center and Kimberly supports that project, but Kimberly also wants to reduce the water prices for a large local business and the voters don't want that, so you should run because the voters would rather elect you.&#8221;</p> 
<p>A disadvantage of this manipulation technique is the risk that the spoiler candidate might win.&#160; Yet this risk is easily minimized.&#160; The financial support can be supplied a bit at a time.&#160; If the polls indicate the results will be too close, the financial support can be stopped early.</p> 
<p>Should laws be written to prevent this kind of financial manipulation of election results?&#160; That's virtually impossible.&#160; After all, even if campaign money sources could be traced back to the people who make the decisions to supply the money, there is nothing unethical, or even unreasonable, about someone funding more than one candidate in a race.&#160; After all, perhaps the person is simply trying to defeat the one candidate they aren't financially supporting.&#160; Also remember (from the first chapter) that wealthy people and organizations contribute money to candidates they don't want to win as a way to gain access in case that candidate wins.</p> 
<p>In the 2000 U.S. Presidential election, was Ralph Nader unknowingly supported with money coming from people who wanted George W.&#160; Bush to win?&#160; After all, many people think that if Ralph Nader had not been in the election, Al Gore would have won.&#160; A few individuals and organizations probably contributed money to Nader to help Bush win, but most of Nader's financial support probably came from people who saw this election as a rare opportunity to express disapproval for both the Republican and Democratic parties.</p> 
<h1>Unsplitting</h1> 
<p>There is a flip side to the concept of splitting the vote.&#160; It occurs when a candidate withdraws from a race so that the most similar candidate is less likely to lose because of splitting the vote.</p> 
<p>Consider the 2003 California gubernatorial (Governor-related) recall election that Arnold Schwarzenegger won.&#160; Plurality voting was used to determine the winner.&#160; Although the news media focused attention on the fact that there were 135 candidates in the race, the more important concept is that the race involved both Republican and Democratic candidates and there were more than two candidates from each of these two main parties.&#160; This unusual situation occurred because the single election served as both a primary and general election.</p> 
<p>Early in the California recall election there were several main Republican candidates and several main Democratic candidates.&#160; The Democratic party's leaders wanted Cruz Bustamante to win, so they convinced the other main Democratic candidates to withdraw (from active campaigning).&#160; This strategy prevented Democratic voters from splitting their votes between multiple Democratic candidates.&#160; The Republican party's leaders wanted Tom McClintock to win, so they asked the other main Republican candidates to withdraw.&#160; Schwarzenegger refused to withdraw, but the others did.&#160; This strategy reduced, but did not eliminate, the splitting of Republican votes.&#160; These withdrawals reduced the race to one main Democratic candidate and two main Republican candidates.&#160; Among the many other candidates, only the Green party's candidate received more than one percent of the votes.</p> 
<p>This consolidation (or unsplitting) tactic increased the chances that either the main Republican candidate besides Schwarzenegger or the main Democratic candidate would win.&#160; In this case the tactic didn't work because Schwarzenegger was too popular.&#160; What's unusual was that the withdrawal of extra candidates occurred publicly, after the candidates' names were on the ballot.&#160; So let's investigate what happened behind the scenes.</p> 
<h1>Party Pressure</h1> 
<p>What caused the extra Republican and Democratic candidates to withdraw from the California gubernatorial recall election?&#160; Very likely the Republican party put pressure on the extra Republican candidates to withdraw, and the Democratic party put pressure on the extra Democratic candidates to withdraw.&#160; Such pressure is easy to apply because most Republican and Democratic candidates heavily depend on financial support from their political parties.</p> 
<p>You can be sure the Republican and Democratic parties clearly understand the effects of votes being split among similar candidates.&#160; In fact, this is why the parties conduct primary elections.&#160; After all, <b>the purpose of a primary election is to identify the party's strongest candidate so that this candidate can compete in the general election without competition from any other candidate in the same party</b>.&#160; In fact, primary elections originated after it became clear that similar candidates usually lost because of votes being split.&#160; To put it bluntly, it would be stupid for a party not to conduct primary elections.</p> 
<p>Now you are ready to understand one of the most important forms of manipulation that occurs in elections.&#160; <b>The financial resources of the Republican and Democratic parties allow these parties to control which candidates win primary elections</b>.&#160; In the early stages of campaigning for a primary election, the political parties commonly choose which candidates to support.&#160; Of course these choices are made by top party leaders in backroom meetings.&#160; During the process of making these choices, the effects of splitting the vote are taken into account.</p> 
<p>Suppose a politician wants to compete in a primary election and the politician has political views that are similar to another politician who is favored by the top party leaders.&#160; It is likely that, directly or indirectly, the optimistic politician is informed that if he or she runs, the political party will not provide financial support, and the party is likely to provide extra financial support to the preferred politician.&#160; This situation provides most wise politicians with sufficient motivation to not file paperwork to become a candidate.</p> 
<p>Occasionally there is a candidate who is wealthy enough to finance a campaign without assistance from the political party.&#160; Yet if the political party wants to defeat that candidate, they can use their party's money to split the vote between the wealthy candidate and an added similar candidate.</p> 
<p>The manipulation of primary elections by the Republican and Democratic parties is subtle, and seems unlikely to make much of a difference.&#160; But this manipulation technique becomes powerful when it is used in conjunction with the manipulation techniques described in Chapter 9.</p> 
<h1>First-Choice Votes Don't Fully Reveal Popularity</h1> 
<p>The unfairness of plurality voting goes beyond the issue of votes getting split.&#160; Plurality voting also allows highly desirable candidates to lose primary elections as if they were actually unpopular.</p> 
<p>To see this clearly, let's expand the earlier example to include a fourth candidate.&#160; In this primary election the names of the candidates are Gordon, Clifford, Kimberly, and Miranda.</p> 
<p>Here is the single-mark ballot for this election.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_126_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 126" width="580" height="510"/></p> 
<p>Out of the 100 voters, 40 voters continue to prefer Gordon.&#160; This time let's suppose that among the remaining voters, 30 voters prefer Clifford, 20 voters prefer Kimberly, and 10 voters prefer Miranda.&#160; These preferences are shown below.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_127_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 127" width="580" height="705"/></p> 
<p>On the surface it appears that Miranda is the least popular candidate.&#160; After all, she receives only 10 votes.</p> 
<p>To determine if Miranda is really the least popular, it is necessary to discover the secondary preferences of the voters.&#160; Specifically it's necessary to know which candidate each voter prefers if their first choice is not available.</p> 
<p>Suppose Miranda is the second choice of all the voters whose first choices are Gordon, Clifford, and Kimberly.&#160; Although it doesn't matter, let's suppose the 10 voters whose first choice is Miranda prefer Kimberly as their second choice.&#160; These secondary preferences are shown below.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_128_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 128" width="580" height="581"/></p> 
<p>Suddenly we have a different perspective about Miranda's popularity.&#160; We now recognize that Miranda is actually more popular than any other candidate, even though Miranda received the fewest votes.</p> 
<p>Is this kind of situation realistic?&#160; Yes.&#160; Suppose this race was between Democratic candidates competing in an industrialized district, and suppose Gordon was a labor-union advocate, Clifford was an advocate for reforming medical insurance and health care, and Kimberly was an advocate for environmental protection.&#160; What would be more popular as a secondary choice?&#160; Miranda could be a middle-of-the-road Democrat who has a reputation for solving problems in a way that involves cooperation and appropriate compromises.</p> 
<p>With these candidate orientations in mind, consider that the voters might be from these three political orientations: labor-union members, middle-class people with health concerns, and environmentalists.&#160; Each of these groups of voters would prefer someone with their specific political orientation, and each group might not appreciate someone with a competing political orientation.&#160; As a result, a middle-of-the-road, problem-solving candidate would appeal to all three groups of voters as their second choice.</p> 
<p>As this example demonstrates, <b>a major weakness of plurality voting is that it doesn't take into account the secondary preferences of the voters</b>.</p> 
<p>The way to know the true popularity of the candidates is to ask all the voters to indicate not only their first choice, but also their second choice, third choice, and so on.&#160; Without this secondary preference information it's often not possible to get results that correctly reflect the full preferences of a majority of voters.</p> 
<p>In an earlier example you learned that <b>the candidate with the most votes is not necessarily the most popular</b>.&#160; Now you can see that <b>the candidate with the fewest votes is not necessarily the least popular</b>.</p> 
<h1>Popping The Bubble Of The Fairness Myth</h1> 
<p>Why does plurality voting appear to produce fair results in U.S. elections?&#160; Because there are only two main political parties.&#160; Except in rare cases, this two-party limit causes either the Republican or Democratic candidate to win a majority of votes.&#160; This result gives the appearance that the winning candidate is preferred by a majority of voters.&#160; In reality, many voters regard general elections as a need to choose between the lesser of two evils.</p> 
<p>The myth that plurality voting produces fair results is also sustained by hiding the unfairness in primary elections.&#160; Keep in mind that separating elections into primary elections and general elections is a way of conducting multiple rounds of voting.&#160; This approach, which is called runoff voting, is explored in the next chapter.&#160; Many people mistakenly believe that runoff voting provides a fair way to overcome the known unfairnesses of plurality voting.&#160; That belief is popped like a bubble in the next chapter.</p> 
<h1>Frustrating Ballot Choices</h1> 
<p>From the perspective of a voter, plurality voting is frustrating.&#160; Let's again look at the ballot in which there are four candidates.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_130_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 130" width="580" height="510"/></p> 
<p>A voter usually knows which candidate he or she prefers the most.&#160; However, as clarified in the previous examples, the preferred candidate may be quite unpopular among other voters.&#160; In this situation a vote for the preferred candidate is likely to be wasted.&#160; To avoid this wasted vote, a voter commonly chooses to vote for another candidate, one who is more likely to win and is preferred over a popular candidate who the voter wants to defeat.</p> 
<p>In other words, when there are three or more candidates in the same race, the choice of who to vote for involves taking into account the likelihood of each candidate winning.&#160; This consideration becomes even more difficult if the somewhat-acceptable candidates appear to be equally popular.&#160; The difficulty becomes choosing a strategy that increases the likelihood of a preferred candidate winning and, at the same time, increases the likelihood of defeating the candidate who the voter dislikes the most.</p> 
<p>These kinds of considerations cause voters to use what is called strategic voting.&#160; The fact that strategic voting can make a difference in the results (in cases where none of the candidates gets a majority) reveals that plurality voting is unfair.</p> 
<p>Ideally, most voters would prefer the opposite of strategic voting, which is called sincere voting.&#160; That's where everyone expresses their real preference for their first choice.&#160; As you have just seen, plurality voting can easily lead to unacceptable results when voters vote sincerely.</p> 
<p>Notice that the frustration of strategic voting does not involve any uncertainty about which candidate the voter wants to win or the relative acceptability of candidates.&#160; Instead the frustration involves choosing how to reduce, into a single ballot mark, the voter's full preferences.</p> 
<p>If voters were allowed to indicate on a ballot their full order of preference for all the candidates in a race, strategic voting would have no effect and the frustration of needing to vote strategically would disappear.&#160; Using that full preference information correctly is also important, so in the next chapter we pop the bubble on the myth that instant-runoff voting is an acceptable way to use full preference information.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If you don't already do so, vote in primary elections.&#160; When necessary, use strategic voting to increase the influence of your vote.&#160; Your vote will have much more influence if you vote in the Republican or Democratic primaries rather than third-party primaries.&#160; Remember that the most significant decisions occur in these primary elections, and fewer votes makes primary elections more vulnerable to manipulation by campaign contributors.</li> 
<li>If you are in a small organization that uses plurality voting, point out that plurality voting does not produce fair results unless one of the choices happens to get a majority of votes.&#160; If the other members of the organization are receptive to an alternative, recommend the voting method described in Chapter 13.</li> 
<li>If someone asks why plurality voting is unfair, use a simple verbal example.&#160; For instance you can point out that if plurality voting were used by dinner guests voting for a beef, chicken, pork, or vegetarian main course, vegetarians might win just because the meat-eaters split their votes among the meat choices.&#160; Obviously each guest's second, and maybe third, choice should be considered.</li> 
</ul> 

<h1>Chapter 6:&#160; False Majority:&#160; Why Runoff Voting Is Unfair</h1> 
<p>The election of nearly every government official in the United States involves runoff voting because general elections are runoff elections for the winners of primary elections.&#160; Presidential elections involve several layers of runoff voting.&#160; Unfortunately, as you will learn in this chapter, runoff voting easily produces unfair results.</p> 
<h1>What, Where, And Why?</h1> 
<p>What is runoff voting?&#160; It consists of conducting multiple rounds of voting.&#160; After each round of voting one or more of the candidates is eliminated so that the next round involves fewer choices.</p> 
<p>Where is runoff voting used in U.S. elections?&#160; The election of nearly every government official involves a runoff election between the most popular Republican candidate and the most popular Democratic candidate (and candidates from smaller parties).&#160; These general elections provide a second round of voting.&#160; The first round of voting occurs in the primary election, which serves to identify the most popular Republican candidate and the most popular Democratic candidate.&#160; (As you learned in the previous chapter, originally general elections were the only elections; primary elections arose later because whichever political party had only one candidate tended to win the general election.)</p> 
<p>Runoff voting is heavily involved in Presidential elections.&#160; Here are descriptions of the rounds of voting.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The first round of voting occurs in the primary election.&#160; The winners of the primary election are actually delegates who attend their party's nominating convention.</li> 
<li>At each party's nominating convention, the delegates cast their votes for the candidates in their party's primary election.</li> 
<li>If the first round of voting by the delegates does not result in one of the candidates receiving a majority of delegate votes, additional rounds of voting are conducted until one of the Presidential candidates receives a majority.&#160; Between rounds of voting the delegates who support less-popular candidates are encouraged to abandon their support for those candidates.</li> 
<li>The next round of voting occurs in the general election where citizen voters cast their ballots for the remaining (party-nominated) Presidential candidates.&#160; The people elected in the general election are actually the people who become known as the Electoral College.</li> 
<li>Within each state the Electoral-College members cast their electoral votes.&#160; Usually all of a state's electoral votes go to just one candidate.</li> 
<li>At the national level, if one of the candidates receives a majority of electoral votes, that candidate is declared to be the winner and there are no more rounds of voting.</li> 
<li>If none of the candidates receives a majority of electoral votes, the final decision is turned over to the U.S. House of Representatives.&#160; In the House of Representatives each state gets one vote.</li> 
<li>If none of the candidates receives a majority of votes in the first round of voting in the House of Representatives, additional rounds of voting are conducted until a candidate receives a majority.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>There is a variation of runoff voting named instant-runoff voting.&#160; Something similar to it is used in Cambridge Massachusetts, and instant-runoff voting has recently been adopted for use in some elections in a few U.S. cities.&#160; (Update: The cities of Aspen Colorado and Burlington Vermont adopted it, used it once in a general election, and then restored plurality voting.&#160; Other cities continue to use it.)</p> 
<p>Why is runoff voting used?&#160; There are two ways to answer this question.&#160; One answer is that runoff voting attempts to overcome the most unfair aspects of plurality voting.&#160; The other answer is that, until recently, runoff voting has provided the only realistic choice in situations where a law requires an elected official to receive a &#8220;majority&#8221; of votes in order to win.</p> 
<h1>How Runoff Voting Works, And Doesn't Work</h1> 
<p>As already mentioned, runoff voting involves multiple rounds of voting.&#160; Between each round of voting there is some kind of elimination process that reduces the number of choices.&#160; The voters who prefer the eliminated candidate, or candidates, must then choose from among the remaining candidates in the next round of voting.</p> 
<p>In what can be called regular runoff voting, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated after each round of voting, and the rounds of voting are repeated until one of the candidates receives a majority.&#160; Obviously the candidate who finally gets the majority of votes is declared the winner.</p> 
<p>The best way to understand regular runoff voting is to consider an example.&#160; Let's suppose these three candidates are competing in a race for the position of Congressional Representative: Clifford, Farah, and Gordon.</p> 
<p>Here is what the single-mark ballot in this election looks like.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_135_fig_2.png" alt="Figure 2 on page 135" width="580" height="436"/></p> 
<p>For this example let's assume there are 90 voters (instead of 100).&#160; Let's suppose that 40 voters prefer Clifford, 20 voters prefer Farah, and the other 30 voters prefer Gordon.&#160; The illustration below shows these preferences.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_136_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 136" width="580" height="643"/></p> 
<p>Based on these preferences, none of the candidates gets a majority of votes.&#160; Farah has the fewest votes so, based on regular runoff voting, she is eliminated.&#160; The remaining candidates, Clifford and Gordon, participate in the second round of voting.</p> 
<p>Suppose that in the second round all 20 voters who voted for Farah in the first round now vote for Clifford.&#160; Naturally the voters who previously voted for Clifford and Gordon continue to support these candidates because they are still in the race.&#160; In this second round Clifford receives 60 votes and Gordon receives 30 votes.&#160; (Remember there are 90 voters in this example.)&#160; The illustration below shows these second-round preferences.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_137_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 137" width="580" height="530"/></p> 
<p>Based on these second-round preferences, Clifford wins the election.&#160; This result appears to be fair because 60 votes out of 90 votes is a clear majority.</p> 
<p>Yet this result is not necessarily fair.&#160; To understand the possible unfairness, let's take a peek at the second preferences of <i>all</i> the voters.</p> 
<p>Let's suppose that among the 40 voters who prefer Clifford as their first choice, 30 of these voters prefer Farah as their second choice, and the other 10 voters prefer Gordon as their second choice.&#160; Among the 30 voters who prefer Gordon as the first choice, let's suppose all 30 of them prefer Farah as their second choice.&#160; (As previously explained, the 20 voters who prefer Farah as their first choice all prefer Clifford as their second choice.)&#160; The illustration below shows these second preferences.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_138_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 138" width="580" height="530"/></p> 
<p>As you can see from counting the rows of voters, 20 voters prefer Clifford as their second choice, 60 voters prefer Farah as their second choice, and 10 voters prefer Gordon as their second choice.&#160; This peek at the second preferences reveals that Farah is much more popular than expected.&#160; In fact 60 voters, which is a clear majority (out of the 90 total voters), prefer Farah as their second choice.&#160; And this count doesn't include the 20 voters who prefer Farah as their first choice.</p> 
<p>It should now be clear that eliminating a candidate (such as Farah in this example) simply because the candidate has the fewest first-choice votes is not as fair as it appears on the surface.</p> 
<p>How do we determine whether Clifford or Farah deserves to win?&#160; We can compare their popularity by supposing there is a two-choice election between Clifford and Farah.&#160; In other words, let's see what would happen if Gordon had not entered the race.</p> 
<p>In this direct comparison we still have 40 voters who prefer Clifford as their first choice, and 20 voters who prefer Farah as their first choice.&#160; In addition, the 30 voters who would have preferred Gordon now all prefer Farah as their first choice.&#160; As shown in the next illustration, these numbers provide a total of 40 votes for Clifford and 50 votes for Farah.&#160; (Remember there are 90, not 100, total voters in this example.)</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_139_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 139" width="580" height="530"/></p> 
<p>We now know that Farah, with 50 votes, is more popular than Clifford, with 40 votes.&#160; Clearly Farah deserves to win the election.&#160; Yet regular runoff voting eliminates Farah after the first round of voting, and declares Clifford to be the winner.</p> 
<p>You can now recognize that <b>the process of eliminating unpopular choices one at a time can easily eliminate the most popular candidate who just doesn't happen to be the first choice of many voters</b>.&#160; This unfair elimination doesn't just happen in the first round.&#160; If there are four or more candidates, the most popular candidate can be eliminated in a second or later round.</p> 
<p><b>The shortcoming of runoff voting is that it does not take into account all the preference information when determining which candidate to eliminate</b>.</p> 
<p>Why is runoff voting used if the results it produces are not always fair?&#160; <b>Runoff voting is superior to plurality voting in terms of fairness</b>.&#160; However, this comparison reveals more about the <b>un</b>fairness of plurality voting than about the fairness or unfairness of runoff voting.&#160; Also, most U.S. general elections involve only two choices, and both runoff and plurality voting produce the same fair results in two-choice contests.</p> 
<p>Why hasn't the relative fairness of regular runoff voting caused it to replace plurality voting?&#160; It is very inconvenient for voters to cast a ballot in each round of voting, especially if only one candidate is eliminated after each round.&#160; Because of this inconvenience, variations of regular runoff voting are used in real elections.&#160; These variations are explained in later sections of this chapter.</p> 
<h1>Plurality Voting In Disguise</h1> 
<p>Runoff voting allows the supporter of a minor candidate to essentially shift his or her vote to another candidate who is more popular.&#160; In this sense runoff voting is just a form of plurality voting, but with the opportunity for the supporters of minor candidates to indicate alternate preferences.&#160; After the truly unpopular candidates have been eliminated, runoff voting reaches its weakness.</p> 
<p><b>The weakness of runoff voting is that it assumes the candidate with the fewest votes is the least popular choice</b>.&#160; This weakness is closely related to the weakness of plurality voting, which is the assumption that the candidate with the most votes is the most popular choice.&#160; In general terms, <b>the underlying weakness of both runoff voting and plurality voting is they attempt to identify the popularity of candidates without taking into account</b> <b><i>all</i></b> <b>the preferences of</b> <b><i>all</i></b> <b>the voters</b>.</p> 
<p>Runoff voting and plurality voting have the same weakness, so it should not be surprising that runoff voting is vulnerable to manipulation techniques that are similar to the ones used with plurality voting.</p> 
<p>Recall that in plurality voting the results can be manipulated by supporting a candidate who splits the votes.&#160; Also, the results can be manipulated by getting a spoiler (vote-splitting) candidate to withdraw from the race.&#160; In a similar way, the results of runoff voting can be manipulated by adding and withdrawing candidates.</p> 
<p>Expanding on the runoff example, suppose we add a fourth candidate named Mora who is politically similar to Gordon.</p> 
<p>And let's suppose that out of the 30 voters who previously voted for Gordon in the first round, 10 voters still vote for Gordon as their first choice, and the other 20 voters now vote for the added candidate, Mora.&#160; The illustration below shows these preferences.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_142_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 142" width="580" height="643"/></p> 
<p>None of the candidates has a majority of votes, and Gordon has the fewest votes, so Gordon is eliminated and there is a second round of voting.&#160; The remaining candidates are Clifford, Farah, and Mora.&#160; The voters who preferred Gordon as their first choice now vote for Farah, which is the same preference these voters had in the original rounds of voting.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_143_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 143" width="580" height="532"/></p> 
<p>There is still no majority, and the least-popular candidate is Mora so she is eliminated.&#160; The result is a final round of voting between Clifford and Farah.&#160; The 20 voters who voted for the eliminated candidate, Mora, now vote for Farah, which is the same secondary preference these voters had in the original rounds of voting.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_144_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 144" width="499" height="750"/></p> 
<p>In this third round of voting Farah receives 50 votes and Clifford receives 40 votes.&#160; Out of the 90 total votes, 50 votes is a clear majority, so Farah is the winner of this four-choice contest.</p> 
<p>Recall that Clifford was the winner of the three-choice contest.&#160; Now Farah is the winner.&#160; The only difference between these two elections is that a fourth candidate, Mora, was added.&#160; The preferences of the voters did not change, yet the outcome changed.&#160; If it seems like the preferences did change, consider that the voters who voted for Mora would not have voted for Gordon if Mora had been in the three-candidate race.</p> 
<p>This example reveals that <b>adding a candidate can cause the results of regular runoff voting to change</b>, even when the added candidate is not a winning candidate in either case.</p> 
<p>Let's also look at the reversed situation.&#160; Suppose the four-choice contest was the original version of the election, and suppose Mora chose to withdraw from that four-choice contest.&#160; This change would have caused Clifford to win the election instead of Farah.&#160; This altered perspective reveals the effect of a candidate withdrawing.</p> 
<p><b>A candidate withdrawing from an election can cause the results of regular runoff voting to change</b>, even when the withdrawn candidate is not a winning candidate in either case.</p> 
<p>Now you can see that the outcome of regular runoff voting can be manipulated by supplying financial support to a spoiler candidate, or by withdrawing financial support from a spoiler candidate.</p> 
<p>Just as in plurality voting, <b>regular runoff voting is very vulnerable to strategic voting</b>.&#160; Strategic voting in this case involves adjusting the order in which a voter votes for the candidates.&#160; If a voter correctly predicts how other voters will vote and uses this information appropriately, a voter can get more influence in the final outcome.&#160; In contrast, a voter may have less influence if he or she votes sincerely.&#160; Strategic voting becomes very effective in runoff voting when there are four or more candidates and none of the candidates is especially popular.</p> 
<h1>Monetary Vulnerability At Conventions</h1> 
<p>Let's consider another kind of runoff voting.&#160; At Presidential nominating conventions the delegates use runoff voting.&#160; The delegates are physically in the same building at the same time, so this situation accommodates as many rounds of voting as it takes to get a majority decision.</p> 
<p>At these conventions the process of eliminating candidates does not follow a simple rule such as eliminating the candidate with the fewest votes.&#160; Instead, the delegates and the candidates they have pledged to support make the decisions about when to switch their support to a different candidate and which candidate to support.</p> 
<p>If there is not a majority on the first round, it is common for top party leaders to meet with a less-popular candidate in a back room or a nearby hotel suite.&#160; These private meetings involve asking the candidate to announce at the podium which other candidate he wants his delegates to support.&#160; In return, the conceding candidate usually receives some sort of political favor.&#160; The favor might involve financial support for a future election, the promise of getting nominated for a specific Cabinet position (if the alternate candidate wins the general election), or even being chosen as the Vice Presidential candidate.</p> 
<p>When a less-popular candidate concedes, he or she may choose to release the delegates without asking them to support any particular remaining candidate.&#160; In this case delegates are free to choose how to switch their vote.</p> 
<p>Bribery of delegates is carefully avoided at nominating conventions, yet money can still influence delegates, especially the ones who have been released by the candidate to whom they were pledged.&#160; As a simple example of the influence of money, more money allows a candidate to hire a better speechwriter and better speaking coach, and that makes the candidate's speeches at the convention more inspiring.&#160; Rousing speeches can inspire delegates to switch their vote to the inspiring candidate, just as well-designed political advertisements influence average voters.</p> 
<p>Of course nominating conventions also are vulnerable to manipulation using the techniques explained in the previous section.&#160; Specifically the sequence in which less-popular candidates are eliminated can affect the outcome.</p> 
<h1>Myth Of Fairness In Instant-Runoff Voting</h1> 
<p>Another variation of runoff voting is called <b>instant-runoff voting</b> (<b>IRV</b>).&#160; It is used in Australia and Ireland, although in these and other countries the method is better known as <b>alternative voting</b>.&#160; Confusingly some U.S. advocates of this method have recently switched to calling it <i>preferential voting</i> even though this name is also used for other voting methods.</p> 
<p>What is instant-runoff voting?&#160; It is equivalent to regular runoff voting except that instead of repeatedly asking voters to vote in each round, the voters are asked to indicate all their preferences at the same time.&#160; This means a voter is asked to indicate his or her first choice, second choice, third choice, and so on.&#160; Based on such complete preference information, the results of all the rounds of voting can be calculated instantly on a computer.</p> 
<p>Here is a preference ballot that shows one way to collect all the preference information from a voter in a three-way election.&#160; (Preference ballots are sometimes called ordinal ballots.)&#160; This sample ballot is marked to indicate that Farah is the voter's first choice, Clifford is the voter's second choice, and Gordon is the voter's third &#8212; and most-disliked &#8212; choice.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_147_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 147" width="578" height="540"/></p> 
<p><b>A significant limitation of instant-runoff voting is that a voter is not allowed to indicate the same level of preference for more than one candidate</b>.&#160; For example, even if a voter has an equal preference between Clifford and Gordon, a ballot marked in this way would be regarded as invalid.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_147_fig_2.png" alt="Figure 2 on page 147" width="580" height="326"/></p> 
<p>This limitation occurs because <b>instant-runoff voting has no way of handling ties on a ballot</b>.&#160; What happens when the voting reaches the point where a voter indicates two or more candidates as their next choice?&#160; A common approach is to disregard the voter's remaining preferences in that race.&#160; In some elections all the preferences on an invalid ballot are ignored.</p> 
<p>A related limitation occurs if a round of voting produces a tie.&#160; Instant-runoff voting (and regular runoff voting) cannot handle this situation.&#160; When it occurs, some alternate method has to be used to determine which candidate to eliminate before the next round.</p> 
<p>It's important to understand that <b>ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking</b>, which are described in Part Three, <b>do not have these limitations</b>.&#160; Why?&#160; VoteFair ranking easily handles a ballot on which the voter has indicated an equal preference for any combination of candidates.&#160; More importantly, VoteFair ranking looks at all the preference information &#8212; not just the preferences that float to the top in instant-runoff voting.</p> 
<p>Earlier in this chapter you learned that a candidate who is actually the most popular choice among all the voters can be eliminated in an earlier round of voting.&#160; For the same reason <b>instant-runoff voting does not always produce fair results</b>.&#160; After all, instant-runoff voting is just a faster version of regular runoff voting, so it has the same weaknesses.</p> 
<p>Why hasn't the unfairness of instant-runoff voting been noticed in the few U.S. cities that use it?&#160; Because <b>instant-runoff voting does produce fair results if there happen to be just one or two dominant candidates and any number of other much-less-popular candidates</b>.&#160; Of course most U.S. general elections fit this pattern because of the two-party dominance of the Republican and Democratic parties.</p> 
<p>As long as instant-runoff voting is used in general elections in only a few U.S. cities, the existing two-party limit (which is explained in Chapter 8) usually causes instant-runoff-voting results to be fair.&#160; However, <b>if instant-runoff voting were used more widely throughout the United States, and especially if it were used in Presidential elections,</b> the two-party limit would cease to exist.&#160; At that point <b>instant-runoff voting would frequently produce results that are clearly unfair.</b></p> 
<p>There are many people who promote instant-runoff voting as superior to plurality voting.&#160; That claim is true, but this comparison reveals more about the <b>un</b>fairness of plurality voting than about the fairness of instant-runoff voting.</p> 
<p>Although instant-runoff voting has been used in Australia since 1918, polls reveal that a large percentage of Australian voters do not like the results produced by their election system.</p> 
<p>An organization named FairVote (not VoteFair) heavily promotes instant-runoff voting for use in the United States.&#160; Their long-term goal is to promote a method called the single transferable vote (which is described in the next section), and instant-runoff voting is a simpler version of the single transferable vote, so this strategy provides a stepping-stone to that goal.&#160; Interestingly the FairVote organization in Canada directly promotes the single transferable vote, and does not promote instant-runoff voting in Canada.&#160; Because of their stepping-stone strategy, the FairVote organization dismisses all other single-winner voting methods, sometimes even using arguments that are not supported by simple mathematical analysis.</p> 
<p>If you find yourself in a situation where a small group of people are intending to use plurality voting and you haven't yet read Part Three of this book, by all means recommend and support the use of instant-runoff voting instead.&#160; <b>Instant-runoff voting is definitely superior to plurality voting, it's relatively easy to explain, and it promotes the idea of allowing voters to indicate more than just their first choice</b>.&#160; But keep in mind that this recommendation assumes the resulting decision will not cause people to suffer if the outcome is unfair.&#160; Also keep in mind that this advice assumes political parties are not involved.</p> 
<h1>Single Transferable Vote In Cambridge</h1> 
<p>Similar to instant-runoff voting is a voting method called the single transferable vote.&#160; This method has the distinction of being used in Cambridge Massachusetts to elect the members of the city council and the members of the city's school committee.&#160; (The city of Cambridge confusingly calls their voting method <i>proportional representation</i> even though the method is significantly different from the method internationally known as proportional representation.)&#160; In the United States the single transferable vote is sometimes called choice voting.</p> 
<p>The single transferable vote is also used in Ireland and Australia.&#160; In Ireland it is used to elect the lower-house Parliament members; in Australia it is called the Hare-Clark system and is used to elect the upper-house Parliament members.</p> 
<p><b>The single transferable vote is used to elect more than one official in the same race</b>.&#160; In the case of electing city-council members in Cambridge, this means all the city-council candidates compete in the same race and the candidate names appear together on the ballot.</p> 
<p>As in instant-runoff voting, a voter marks a preference ballot (also called a preferential ballot) to indicate a first choice, second choice, third choice, and so on.&#160; Here is an example of such a ballot in which there are 20 candidates competing for nine open seats.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_150_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 150" width="580" height="569"/></p> 
<p>As in instant-runoff voting, <b>the single transferable vote cannot accommodate a ballot in which a voter indicates two or more candidates at the same level of preference</b>.&#160; Considering the number of candidates, this limitation makes it challenging to correctly mark the ballot.</p> 
<p>The challenge is even greater if a voter actually has an equal preference for two candidates.&#160; In this case the voter must somehow choose one of the candidates to rank at a higher preference level.&#160; A failure to comply with the no-ties limitation causes the voter's preferences for this race, including the preferences that are valid, to be discarded as invalid.</p> 
<p>Even if all the voters correctly mark their ballots, the single transferable vote easily produces unfair results.&#160; Unfairness can easily occur because, just as in instant-runoff voting, <b>only some of the alternate preferences of some of the voters are considered</b>.&#160; This means the single transferable vote shares some of the vulnerabilities of instant-runoff voting.</p> 
<p>The single transferable vote involves yet another unfairness.&#160; <b>The order in which the ballots are counted can affect the election results</b>.&#160; To prevent the intentional manipulation of results, the Cambridge election commission uses a random drawing before the election to determine which precinct's ballots are counted first, which precinct's ballots are counted second, and so on.&#160; Although this approach prevents intentionally manipulated results, it doesn't prevent <b>un</b>intentionally unfair results.&#160; In fact, <b>the need to introduce randomness reveals that the single transferable vote does not achieve results that are completely fair</b>.</p> 
<p>How does the single transferable vote work?&#160; It involves a threshold that specifies how many votes a candidate needs in order to win one of the available seats.&#160; (It isn't important to know how the threshold number is calculated because the voting method doesn't produce fair results.)&#160; During the counting of votes, when a candidate receives enough votes to reach the threshold, the candidate wins one of the seats.</p> 
<p>The alternate preference information on the ballots is only considered when a voter expresses a preference for a candidate who has already won (by reaching the threshold).&#160; At this point the voter's vote shifts (or <i>transfers</i>) to the voter's next preference.&#160; This is the part of the method where the order in which ballots are counted can affect the outcome.&#160; Specifically, at this point we can ask, &#8220;Why is this particular ballot having its alternate preferences considered instead of an earlier ballot that had different alternate preferences?&#8221;</p> 
<p>After going through all the ballots once, there are likely to be unfilled seats, so additional rounds of voting are used.&#160; Between each round of voting at least one candidate (normally the one with the fewest votes) is eliminated.&#160; As you can see, the elimination process is similar to instant-runoff voting.&#160; The big difference is that instant-runoff voting requires a majority of &#8220;votes&#8221; for the single winner, whereas the single transferable vote requires only a threshold of &#8220;votes&#8221; for each of the winners.</p> 
<p>Why is the single transferable vote used in Cambridge (Massachusetts), Australia, and Ireland if it produces results that are not completely fair?&#160; Because <b>the use of the single transferable vote increases fairness in terms of making it possible for political minorities to get representation</b>.&#160; In Cambridge the previously unfair lack of representation showed up as an absence of minorities among city-council members.&#160; In Australia the single transferable vote was adopted to compensate for an absence of aboriginal citizens in Parliament.</p> 
<p>Although the single transferable vote increases the representation of large minorities, it reduces the fairness of identifying which non-minority candidates should win.&#160; This trade-off is reasonable, especially when you consider that the traditional approach of using plurality voting and electing each city-council member from geographically determined wards does not produce fair results either.</p> 
<p>If the single transferable vote were the only way to increase the representation of minorities, then it would be used much more often.&#160; Instead, more than half the democracies in the world use the voting method called proportional representation.&#160; It accomplishes what the single transferable vote attempts to accomplish.</p> 
<h1>Runoff Elections Known As General Elections</h1> 
<p>The biggest use of runoff elections in the United States occurs during a general election where the winner of a Republican primary competes against the winner of a Democratic primary.&#160; This arrangement is different from the runoff elections described earlier in this chapter.&#160; Why?&#160; Because <b>in a primary election Republicans do not vote on Democratic candidates, and Democrats do not vote on Republican candidates</b>.&#160; Can this situation produce unfair results?&#160; Yes.</p> 
<p>The best way to understand this unfairness is through an example.&#160; Let's suppose that in the Republican primary election there are two candidates named Clifford and Farah, and in the Democratic primary election there are two candidates named Gordon and Mora.</p> 
<p>To keep the numbers simple let's suppose there happen to be exactly 50 Republican voters and 50 Democratic voters.&#160; This means the 50 Republican voters would vote in the Republican primary and, on the same day, the 50 Democratic voters would vote in the Democratic primary.</p> 
<p>First let's consider the Republican primary.&#160; Suppose 20 Republican voters vote for Clifford, and the other 30 voters vote for Farah.&#160; The next illustration shows these preferences.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_153_fig_2.png" alt="Figure 2 on page 153" width="580" height="399"/></p> 
<p>Based on these votes, Farah would win the Republican primary.</p> 
<p>Now let's consider the Democratic primary.&#160; Let's suppose 30 Democratic voters vote for Gordon, and the other 20 voters vote for Mora.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_154_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 154" width="580" height="401"/></p> 
<p>Based on these votes, Gordon would win the Democratic primary.</p> 
<p>Some months after the primary election there is a general election in which the two winners, Farah and Gordon, compete against each other.</p> 
<p>In the general election let's suppose the 30 Republican voters who voted for Farah again vote for Farah, and the 30 Democratic voters who voted for Gordon again vote for Gordon.&#160; The other voters preferred candidates who lost, so who would they vote for?&#160; Let's suppose the 20 Republican voters who originally voted for Clifford are now divided in their preferences and 10 of them vote for Farah, and the other 10 vote for Gordon.&#160; Finally, let's suppose the 20 Democratic voters who originally voted for Mora now vote for the remaining Democratic candidate, Gordon.&#160; The illustration below shows these preferences.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_155_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 155" width="580" height="583"/></p> 
<p>As you can see, the Democratic candidate Gordon would win the general election with 60 votes.&#160; Not only are the 60 votes for Gordon more than the 40 votes received by Farah, but 60 votes out of 100 votes is also a majority.&#160; On the surface this outcome seems fair.</p> 
<p>Now let's consider what would have happened if Farah had not been a candidate in the Republican primary.&#160; (The result will change in a surprising way.)&#160; Clifford would have won the Republican primary because of being the only Republican candidate.&#160; The outcome of the Democratic primary would not be affected, so the general election would be a contest between Clifford and Gordon.</p> 
<p>In the revised general election let's suppose the voters have the preferences shown in the next illustration.&#160; The voters' opinions remain unchanged.&#160; (The 30 voters who voted for Gordon in the primary would again vote for Gordon.&#160; And naturally the 20 Republican voters who preferred Clifford in the original version of the Republican primary would vote for Clifford.)&#160; Let's suppose the 30 Republican voters who would have preferred Farah now vote for the only Republican candidate, Clifford.&#160; Finally let's suppose that among the 20 Democratic voters who voted for Mora in the primary, 10 of them again vote for Gordon and the other 10 vote for Clifford because they prefer him over Gordon.&#160; (Remember that cross-party voting is common, not rare.)</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_156_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 156" width="580" height="581"/></p> 
<p>As you can see, the Republican candidate Clifford now receives 60 votes and Gordon receives 40 votes.&#160; Therefore Clifford &#8212; not Gordon &#8212; wins the election.&#160; This means the winner of the general election is a Republican instead of a Democrat.&#160; Yet the only difference is that a losing candidate, Farah, chose not to enter the race.&#160; Very significantly, none of the voters changed their preferences between the two versions of the election.</p> 
<p>What accounts for the difference in outcome?&#160; Some Republican voters did not like the original winner of the Republican primary, Farah.&#160; Also, some Democratic voters like the Republican Clifford, but dislike the Republican Farah.</p> 
<p>This example illustrates an important, but often overlooked, aspect of elections.&#160; <b>The candidate who is truly the most popular candidate among all the voters is not necessarily the most popular among the voters in that candidate's own party</b>.&#160; This concept is important, so let's consider it from another perspective.&#160; <b>Just because a candidate is the most popular choice among the voters in a party does not mean that all these voters like this winning candidate better than the candidate who wins the other party's primary</b>.</p> 
<p>What kind of real-life situation could produce an outcome similar to the example above?&#160; Imagine that Clifford is charismatic and holds traditional Republican views except that he speaks out in favor of environmental protection in situations where financial interests are not compromised.&#160; Imagine that Farah is not as charismatic, holds traditional Republican views including being against environmental protection, and is a vocal opponent of abortion.&#160; Farah would attract more votes among Republicans, but she would attract relatively few votes from Democratic voters.&#160; In contrast, Clifford might not be as popular among Republican voters, but if he won the Republican primary, then he could attract a significant number of votes from Democratic voters, in addition to getting all the Republican votes.</p> 
<h1>Why Obama Won</h1> 
<p>Does the unfairness of runoff voting ever affect real election results?&#160; Yes.&#160; Consider the 2008 Presidential election that Barack Obama won.&#160; Although it is impossible to meaningfully and fully track the flow of money in campaign contributions, it is likely that some of the money donated to Obama during the Democratic primary election came from Republicans.&#160; The goal for this money was to defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton (wife of former President Bill Clinton), whose liberal agenda, especially regarding health-insurance reform, was highly offensive to many wealthy people who favor the Republican party.&#160; This cross-party primary-election funding strategy was based on the belief that during the runoff (general) election many Democratic voters would cross party lines to avoid voting for an African-American, and based on the belief that few Republican voters would cross party lines to vote for a Democratic African-American.&#160; If racial issues had been significant, this attempt to take advantage of the unfairness of runoff elections might have been effective.</p> 
<p>In this case the strategy failed because the Republican-party presidential candidate, John McCain, had a record of supporting very few meaningful reforms during his many years in Congress, while Obama appeared to be an outsider willing to implement reforms that were opposed by Washington DC insiders.&#160; This difference motivated a significant number of Republican voters to cross party lines and vote for Obama.&#160; As a further strategy mistake, McCain's Vice-Presidential running mate, Sarah Palin, was chosen to attract Democratic voters who wanted to vote for a female, but she lacked a basic knowledge about geography and foreign affairs and therefore failed to attract sufficient votes from those Democratic voters.</p> 
<p>If Hillary Clinton, rather than Barack Obama, had won the Democratic primary, would she have won the general election?&#160; We don't know.&#160; She was eliminated early, before all the voters in both parties had an opportunity to express their preference for or against her.&#160; The separation of primary and general elections makes it difficult to judge the fairness of the final outcome because cross-party preferences are seldom collected or analyzed.</p> 
<p>Another example of runoff-voting unfairness occurred four years later in the 2012 Presidential election when Obama won against the winner of the Republican primary election, Mitt Romney.&#160; As a member of a religion with a well-known bias against women, Romney lost to Obama the votes of many Republican women, and he failed to attract cross-party votes from Democratic women.&#160; In addition, Romney failed to attract votes from minorities because he made comments that revealed a bias against minorities, and because the Republican-party nominating convention and Romney's fundraising events included almost no minority participants.&#160; If instead the Republican presidential primary had been won by a candidate who was not biased against women and minorities, and if that candidate was competent and held mainstream Republican views, that Republican candidate might have defeated Obama.</p> 
<h1>Abandon Primaries?</h1> 
<p>The separation of an election into a primary election and a general (runoff) election can produce different results compared to allowing all voters to vote on all candidates.&#160; Yet this reduced fairness is not serious enough to justify abandoning the separation of elections into primary elections and general elections.&#160; Fortunately there is a way to overcome the separation unfairness.&#160; It consists of allowing two candidates &#8212; instead of just one &#8212; to advance from each major-party primary election into a general election.&#160; This means there are two Republicans and two Democrats in the general election.&#160; The voting methods described in Part Three provide fair results in these improved general elections.</p> 
<p>Another reason for not abandoning primary elections is that they serve another purpose beyond identifying the most popular candidate within the party.&#160; Primary elections also serve to influence a party's agenda and the priority of items within the agenda.&#160; For example, consider a Republican primary in which there are two candidates who are very similar in terms of charisma and political orientation, but one of the candidates expresses support for protecting water and air quality and the other candidate expresses support for abandoning laws that protect water and air quality.&#160; The outcome of this election would convey to the political-party leaders the degree to which Republicans are concerned about water and air quality.&#160; This needed influence on party agendas requires the continued use of primary elections in spite of fairness issues.</p> 
<h1>Why Doesn't The Unfairness Get Noticed?</h1> 
<p>Why is so little attention given to the unfairness of runoff voting in U.S. elections?&#160; There are several reasons.</p> 
<p>The main reason is that the final round of voting normally produces a majority outcome.&#160; This presence of a majority result gives the appearance of fairness.&#160; In reality, <b>conducting multiple rounds of voting simply hides the lack of a true majority within an earlier round of voting</b>.</p> 
<p>Another reason for the lack of attention is that all the preferences of all the voters are not collected.&#160; This lack of complete information makes it difficult to judge the fairness of the results.</p> 
<p>When most people look for evidence of unfair election results, they look for situations where the winning candidate seems to be from the wrong political party.&#160; Yet that can only happen in general elections.&#160; <b>In primary elections, where the biggest unfairness occurs, the winner is never from the wrong political party because the winner of a Republican primary is always a Republican and the winner of a Democratic primary is always a Democrat</b>.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In small group situations, such as family gatherings and employee meetings, try using runoff voting instead of plurality voting.&#160; If preferences are expressed by raising hands, use regular runoff voting.&#160; If preferences are collected on paper, use instant-runoff voting.&#160; The results are usually fairer than if plurality voting is used, and you can better understand what kinds of situations cause unfair results in runoff voting.</li> 
<li>If someone recommends using instant-runoff voting in governmental elections, point out that instant-runoff voting does not produce reliably fair results when there are more than two popular choices in a race.&#160; Also point out that if this method were widely used, the two-party limit (explained in Chapter 8) would cease to exist, and that would create the need for (unfair) coalitions in Congress and state legislatures.</li> 
</ul> 

<h1>Chapter 7:&#160; Wayward Attempts:&#160; Alternate Voting Methods That Didn't Fly</h1> 
<p>In this chapter you will learn about unsuccessful attempts to invent a voting method that overcomes the weaknesses of plurality voting and runoff voting.&#160; These alternate voting methods are often suggested as better, so it's worth understanding why they are unfair and why they are seldom adopted for use in real elections.</p> 
<h1>Using Counts Supplied By Voters</h1> 
<p>Let's start by exploring a frequently recommended method of voting.&#160; The idea is to allow voters to assign sequential numbers to each candidate in a race, and requesting that each number be used only once.&#160; After collecting the ballots, the numbers are added to determine which candidate receives the most counts.&#160; This method is called the Borda-count method because Jean-Charles de Borda published a description of it in 1781.</p> 
<p>Below is a sample ballot for use in Borda-count voting.&#160; In this case the allowed numbers range from 1 to 4.&#160; A voter has assigned the number 4 to Mora to indicate this candidate as the most preferred.&#160; The number 1 is assigned to Farah to indicate this candidate as the most disliked.&#160; The number 2 is assigned to both remaining candidates, Clifford and Gordon, to indicate they are equally preferred.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_162_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 162" width="580" height="519"/></p> 
<p>When this kind of ballot is used, some voters inevitably don't follow the instructions.&#160; For example, some voters are confused about whether to use large or small numbers for their favorites, some voters use large numbers such as 999 for candidates they like and the number zero for their most-disliked candidate, voters often write numbers that are illegible, and (as shown in the sample ballot) a voter may use the same number more than once.</p> 
<p>One way to reduce these problems is to have the voter draw marks instead of write numbers.&#160; Such a ballot is shown below.&#160; It is marked in a way that is equivalent to the previous ballot.&#160; The numbering direction is reversed, but the numbers are easily adjusted for Borda-count use.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_163_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 163" width="580" height="469"/></p> 
<p><b>If the election rules require the rejection of invalid ballots,</b> including ballots on which the same number is used more than once (such as the sample above), <b>the outcome will fail to correctly represent everyone who casts a ballot</b>.</p> 
<p>If the election rules allow ballots that use the same number more than once, many voters will assign the highest ranking to the candidate he or she likes most, and assign the lowest ranking to all the remaining candidates.&#160; This strategy excessively increases the chance of winning for the highest-marked candidate, and excessively decreases the chance of winning for the other candidates.&#160; Even worse, <b>a voter who marks the ballot as requested, without using the same number more than once, gets less influence than the strategic voter</b>.</p> 
<p>Yet another unfairness is that adding or withdrawing a candidate easily changes the results, even if the added or withdrawn candidate is not a winning candidate.&#160; This weakness, which is shared by plurality voting, makes the Borda-count method vulnerable to financial manipulation through the funding of &#8220;spoiler&#8221; candidates.</p> 
<p>How unfair is the Borda-count method?&#160; Jean-Charles de Borda himself said, &#8220;My scheme is intended only for honest men.&#8221;</p> 
<h1>Score Ballot</h1> 
<p>A type of ballot named the <b>score ballot</b> also asks the voter to assign a number to each candidate.&#160; But this kind of ballot allows the same number to be used more than once, and the numbers do not need to be sequential.</p> 
<p>The highest score and the lowest score can be any numbers chosen by the election officials.&#160; Here are some sample ranges.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 to 5 (such as used to rate movies with one to five stars)</li> 
<li>0 to 100</li> 
<li>1 to 10</li> 
<li>-5 to +5 (minus five to plus five, where zero is neutral)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>To avoid problems that arise when voters write numbers, the range of numbers can be kept small, and a printed ballot can contain one column of ovals for each valid score.&#160; Yet if the range of valid scores is large enough, a voter can use big gaps to indicate how strongly the voter likes and dislikes each candidate.</p> 
<p>Election-method experts do not agree on which range of numbers is best, and some experts recommend labeling the scores with names &#8212; such as <i>excellent</i> and <i>bad</i> &#8212; rather than numbers, and different names are suggested, so score ballots do not have a well-defined style.</p> 
<p>Marking a number-based score ballot sincerely is done by giving the highest score to the voter's favorite candidate, and giving the lowest score to the most-disliked candidate.&#160; Ideally the remaining candidates are given scores that indicate how strongly the voter likes or dislikes each candidate.&#160; If voters mark ballots this way, score ballots yield more information about voter preferences than any other ballot type.</p> 
<p>The easiest way to count score ballots is simply to use addition to calculate a total for each candidate.&#160; The candidate with the highest total count is the winner.&#160; This counting method (along with the use of the score ballot) is named <b>range voting</b>.&#160; (Sometimes it's called <b>score voting</b>.)&#160; If all the ballots are marked sincerely, range-voting results are usually, but not always, fair.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately range voting is quite vulnerable to strategic voting.&#160; <b>The most common strategy is to give the highest score to the candidates the voter approves, and give the lowest score to the candidates the voter disapproves, and not use any other possible score</b>.</p> 
<p>If every voter votes this way, the results are the same as the method named approval voting, which is explained later in this chapter.&#160; If some voters follow the instructions that request sincere voting, and other voters vote strategically, then the results are not fair because a sincere voter gets less influence than a strategic voter.&#160; Because of these unfairnesses, range voting is rarely used as an election method.</p> 
<p>A familiar version of range voting is to use the loudness of applause to pick a winning contestant in a talent contest or costume contest.&#160; In this situation you can vote strategically by applauding as loud as you can for the contestants you strongly like, and by <i>silently</i> pretending to applaud for all the other contestants.&#160; If instead you applaud at least a little for every contestant, you are weakening your influence for the times you applaud loudly.</p> 
<p>If you are the person conducting applause-based voting and you want to defeat this tactic, you should conduct at least two or three rounds of voting.&#160; At each round use a threshold applause level where you hear a clear difference between approval and not-so-strong approval.&#160; In other words you will not know until you hear the responses how many contestants will move on to the next round.&#160; If the winner is not obvious when three or four contestants remain, you should include a final round of voting between the top two contestants.&#160; In other words, use a combination of approval voting (explained later in this chapter) and runoff voting because this combination is fairer than using only range voting.</p> 
<p>A better way to count score ballots is to use a method named <b>majority judgment</b>.&#160; This method does the counting in a clever way that reduces the benefits of strategic voting.&#160; Unfortunately this method is difficult to comprehend.&#160; In case you have an interest in how this method works, here is a very brief explanation, but skip ahead to the next paragraph if it doesn't make sense.&#160; Starting with any candidate, count the number of voters who give this candidate the lowest score.&#160; If the count is more than half the voters, then the candidate is given this score.&#160; If the count is less than half the voters, the number of voters who assign the next-higher score is added, and the process is repeated until the count exceeds half the voters.&#160; Repeat these calculations to identify each candidate's <i>median</i> score.&#160; Whichever candidate has the highest median score is the winner.&#160; Frequently two or more candidates have the same median score, so the tie is broken by removing ballots one at a time as needed, where the removed ballots are the ones that assign the same median score to the tied candidates.</p> 
<p>The majority-judgment method produces results that are fairer than range voting, mostly because it is less vulnerable to strategic voting.&#160; Yet this method is still significantly vulnerable to strategic voting, and therefore it can easily yield unfair results.</p> 
<p>The underlying weakness of the score ballot is that big preference gaps imply that one voter's vote can, and should, have more influence than another voter's vote just because the first voter conveys a higher level of importance compared to the second voter.&#160; In the distant future score ballots may become more useful, but that change will require better ways to count this kind of ballot.</p> 
<h1>Ballots In Cumulative, Limited, And Approval Voting</h1> 
<p>There are three somewhat-similar voting methods called cumulative voting, limited voting, and approval voting.&#160; These methods allow a voter to give more than one mark in each race.</p> 
<p><b>In cumulative voting a voter can give as many marks as there are candidates in the race</b>.&#160; For example, in a four-way contest a voter can give up to four marks.&#160; The voter can distribute the marks among the candidates in any way.&#160; If desired, all the marks can be given to the same candidate.&#160; The more marks a candidate receives, the more likely that candidate will win.&#160; A voter can choose to use fewer than the number of available marks, but in that case the voter is failing to use some of his or her influence.</p> 
<p>Here is a sample ballot filled out according to the rules of cumulative voting.&#160; The voter has given three marks to Farah and one mark to Mora.&#160; <b>In this kind of ballot the left-to-right position of a mark has no significance</b>.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_164_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 164" width="580" height="487"/></p> 
<p>What happens when a voter uses fewer than the number of available marks?&#160; Such a ballot is still valid, but the marks are not given extra influence just because there are fewer of them.&#160; The way in which this situation affects the outcome depends on how the voter has distributed the votes.</p> 
<p><b>Limited voting is very similar to cumulative voting except that the number of marks a voter can supply is less than the number of candidates</b>.&#160; Typically the number of marks a voter can supply is equal to the number of candidates minus one.&#160; If there are a large number of candidates, such as 50 candidates, then each voter is allowed to distribute points (&#8220;votes&#8221;), such as 20 points, among those candidates.</p> 
<p>Here is a sample ballot for a four-way contest using limited voting, where each voter is allowed to mark three ovals.&#160; In this case the voter has given two marks to Farah and one mark to Mora.&#160; As in cumulative voting, the left-to-right position of a mark has no significance.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_165_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 165" width="525" height="519"/></p> 
<p>Approval voting uses a ballot that looks similar to plurality (single-mark) voting.&#160; However, <b>in approval voting a voter can give one mark (each) to as many of the candidates as desired</b>.&#160; As the name suggests, the intention is to find out which candidates a voter approves, and which candidates the voter disapproves.</p> 
<p>Here is a sample ballot filled out according to the rules of approval voting.&#160; The voter has marked both Farah and Mora as acceptable candidates.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_166_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 166" width="467" height="519"/></p> 
<p><b>In cumulative, limited, and approval voting</b>, the number of marks for each candidate are counted, and these counts directly determine the results.&#160; If the race is to fill one opening, <b>the candidate who receives the most marks wins the race</b>.</p> 
<p>Cumulative, limited, and approval voting are vulnerable to the same unfairnesses as plurality voting.&#160; Specifically, strategic voting can increase a voter's influence, two or more candidates with similar political views can cause the votes to be split, and a minority group can focus their votes on a single candidate.</p> 
<p><b>The biggest weakness of cumulative, limited, and approval voting is that sincere voting</b> &#8212; in which a voter marks the ballot in a way that basically reflects the voter's preferences &#8212; <b>causes that sincere voter to have less influence compared to voters who vote strategically</b>.</p> 
<p>These unfairnesses account for why cumulative, limited, and approval voting are used only occasionally.</p> 
<h1>Approval Voting Sometimes</h1> 
<p>Interestingly, approval voting is used in the United Nations to elect the Secretary General.&#160; Why is this method sometimes used?</p> 
<p><b>Of the voting methods explained so far, approval voting provides the best balance between fair results and resistance to strategic voting</b>.&#160; This advantage makes approval voting useful in special situations.</p> 
<p>Suppose a group of people are raising their hands to vote on a non-critical issue such as where to eat a meal together.&#160; In this case approval voting is quite useful and reasonably fair.&#160; Each voter raises their hand for each choice they approve, and the choice that gets the most raised hands is regarded as the most popular.</p> 
<p>Approval voting's vulnerability to strategic voting is not a significant disadvantage in situations where the risk of making a &#8220;wrong&#8221; choice does not have big negative consequences.&#160; A few voters might withhold approval for a popular choice they slightly like, and that strategy increases the likelihood that another somewhat-popular choice will win instead.&#160; Yet this strategy simply amounts to a refinement in deciding which choices are really acceptable and which choices are really not acceptable.</p> 
<p>Another situation where approval voting is useful is when the number of choices is large.&#160; For example, approval voting would have been useful in the 2003 California gubernatorial <i>recall</i> election because it had 135 candidates, including the winner Arnold Schwarzenegger, competing to become Governor.&#160; The method would have prevented any of the really unpopular candidates from winning.&#160; Lots of Republicans did not like the party-approved Republican candidate, and lots of Democrats did not like the party-approved Democratic candidate, so the most-approved candidate probably would have been Schwarzenegger.&#160; The extra Republican and Democratic candidates who withdrew because of pressure from their party's leaders (to avoid vote splitting) could have continued to campaign, without giving any advantage to the opposite political party.</p> 
<p>If voters vote sincerely, instead of strategically, approval voting is not significantly vulnerable to vote splitting.&#160; This means that if there are two similar candidates, most voters will mark approval for both candidates or neither candidate.&#160; Yet if a significant number of voters vote for one of the similar candidates and not the other, the unfairness of vote splitting becomes significant.&#160; This is why the results can be unfair if the method is used when the outcome is very important.</p> 
<p>If approval voting were used in all U.S. <i><b>primary</b></i> elections, there would be a big improvement in the fairness of those elections.&#160; Any unfairness caused by widespread strategic voting would probably be acceptable because the winner would never be from the &#8220;wrong&#8221; political party.</p> 
<p>However, if approval voting were used in U.S. <i><b>general</b></i> elections, the results often would be unfair.&#160; That unfairness would occur when the official winner would have lost if the ballot had not included the less-popular candidates.</p> 
<p><b>A big advantage of approval voting is that it can use the same ballots we now use</b>.&#160; All that would change would be the wording that now requests that the voter not mark more than one candidate, and the functioning of the software in the ballot-counting equipment that currently interprets multiple marks in the same race as a <i>spoiled</i> ballot.</p> 
<p>Although this method is not a good choice for widespread use in U.S. governmental elections, <b>approval voting would be a good starting point for a nation that is making the transition to democracy</b>.&#160; The results would be much fairer than using single-mark ballots, yet it would be just as easy for citizens to learn to use.</p> 
<h1>One Unfairness Overcomes Another</h1> 
<p>Cumulative voting has the distinction of having been used in Illinois for 110 years (from 1870 until 1980), and it is still used in a few local areas in Alabama and Texas.&#160; Cumulative voting is also used to elect board members in many U.S. corporations.&#160; Interestingly, six states legally require using the cumulative-voting method for electing corporate board members.&#160; For reasons you will soon learn, cumulative voting is not used for government elections in countries other than the United States.</p> 
<p>Why is cumulative voting used even though it is known to produce unfair results?&#160; To appreciate why, let's consider the election of city-council members in a city in Alabama.&#160; Let's suppose that in this city two out of 10 voters (twenty percent) are African-American.&#160; If there are ten city-council members, and each city-council member is elected from each ward, and the boundary lines between wards do not segregate voters according to racial considerations, plurality voting would typically produce a city council in which none of the city-council members are African-American.&#160; This outcome is obviously unfair.&#160; If cumulative voting is used in this situation, at least one African-American can get elected to the city council.</p> 
<p>Recall that one of the unfairnesses of cumulative voting is that a group of voters can strategically vote in a way that concentrates all their votes on a single candidate.&#160; In the example we are considering, suppose there is just one candidate who is African-American and every African-American voter gives all their multiple votes to that candidate.&#160; The African-American candidate is likely to win a seat, and this outcome would provide African-Americans with at least some representation on the city council.</p> 
<p>As this example illustrates, <b>cumulative voting provides a way to increase representation for voters who are numerous enough to deserve representation, yet not numerous enough to elect someone if plurality voting is used</b>.&#160; This issue of representation also applies to nonracial differences such as liberal versus conservative and labor versus management, but such differences are not as visible as differences in race or gender.&#160; An obvious lack of representation for African-American voters is what led judges to approve the use of cumulative voting in areas of Alabama and Texas.</p> 
<p>Lack of representation is not a problem in countries that use proportional representation.&#160; After all, the whole point of proportional representation is to ensure that minority parties achieve an appropriate level of representation.&#160; <b>In other countries if issues of representation arise, proportional representation &#8212; not cumulative voting &#8212; is the well-established solution</b>.</p> 
<p>Attempts to implement proportional representation in the United States have failed, so cumulative voting provides an alternative to deal with clear cases of many voters being unrepresented.&#160; In these situations the less-obvious unfairnesses of cumulative voting are outweighed by the clearly visible unfairnesses of plurality voting.</p> 
<h1>Seeing A Trend</h1> 
<p>The appeal of Borda-count voting, score ballots, cumulative voting, limited voting, and approval voting is that they provide a way for a voter to indicate more than just a single preference.&#160; In particular, the use of numbers or multiple marks on a ballot enables a voter to give more support to preferred candidates, less support to less-preferred candidates, and no support to the most disliked candidates.</p> 
<p>The occasional use of multiple-mark ballots makes it clear that voters are unhappy with single-mark ballots.&#160; Obviously voters want to mark ballots in a way that expresses different levels of support for the candidates.</p> 
<p>It is useful to know that the voting methods explained so far were invented before the first electronic computer was built.&#160; As a result the people who originated these voting methods could not accommodate calculation methods that involved much more than counting marks on ballots.&#160; This insight reveals their weakness.&#160; <b>The biggest problem with these methods is the way in which the results are determined</b>.</p> 
<h1>Condorcet Counting</h1> 
<p>During the late 1700s there lived a French mathematician and philosopher named Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas Caritat, whose title was the Marquis de Condorcet.&#160; He invented a voting method that became known as <b>Condorcet voting</b>.&#160; (Condorcet is a French name pronounced <i>kon-dor-say</i>.)&#160; In this method the winner is determined in a way that is different from simply counting marks and declaring as the winner the candidate with the most marks.</p> 
<p><b>Condorcet voting uses ranked ballots on which each voter indicates his or her order of preference for all the candidates.</b></p> 
<p>Here is a ranked ballot for a three-choice contest.&#160; This ballot is marked to indicate Farah as the voter's most-preferred candidate, Clifford as the voter's second-most-preferred candidate, and Gordon as the voter's least-preferred candidate.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_169_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 169" width="580" height="432"/></p> 
<p>Now comes the interesting part.&#160; Based on the information in such preference ballots it's possible to answer these questions.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If the election only involved Clifford and Farah, which candidate would win?</li> 
<li>If the election only involved Clifford and Gordon, which candidate would win?</li> 
<li>If the election only involved Farah and Gordon, which candidate would win?</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Using Condorcet voting, whichever candidate wins all of his or her one-on-one &#8212; or pairwise &#8212; elections is declared the winner.&#160; For example, suppose Farah wins the contest against Clifford, and also wins the contest against Gordon.&#160; In this case Farah would win the three-choice election because she wins both of the pairwise contests in which she competes.&#160; In this case it does not matter who wins the pairwise race between Clifford and Gordon.</p> 
<p>In general terms, <b>whichever candidate wins all of his or her pairwise contests wins the election.</b></p> 
<p>Notice this approach overcomes one of the unfairnesses of plurality voting.&#160; Recall that in plurality voting a candidate can win the election even if he or she is less popular than one of the other candidates, especially if the votes are split among similar candidates.&#160; <b>Using Condorcet voting it is impossible for the election to be won by a candidate who is less popular than any other of the candidates</b>.</p> 
<p>As a bonus, Condorcet voting provides information that can be used to judge the fairness of the outcome.&#160; If someone thinks that their preferred candidate should have won, the person can see that the winner won the pairwise contest against that voter's preferred candidate.</p> 
<p>What is the main weakness of Condorcet voting?&#160; <b>Frequently this method fails to identify a winning candidate because none of the candidates wins all of his or her pairwise contests</b>.&#160; For example, in our three-choice election it is possible for Clifford to win the first pairwise contest, Gordon to win the second pairwise contest, and Farah to win the third pairwise contest.&#160; This outcome produces one win for each of the three candidates, which means none of the candidates wins both of his or her pairwise contests.&#160; In this case Condorcet voting fails to identify a winner.</p> 
<p><b>If Condorcet voting identifies a winner, then the result is always fair</b>.&#160; If a different voting method always identifies the <i><b>Condorcet winner</b></i>, then that method meets the characteristic known as the <i><b>Condorcet criterion</b></i>.</p> 
<p>Recently (after the print edition of this book was published), the term <i>Condorcet method<b>s</b></i> (plural) has come to have a separate meaning, different from the <i>Condorcet method</i>.&#160; The plural form refers to all the voting methods that find the same winner as Condorcet voting.&#160; These Condorcet method<b>s</b> (which includes VoteFair ranking) do not have the disadvantage of sometimes producing indecisive results.</p> 
<p>The most important point here is that <b>Condorcet voting reveals there are other ways to identify a winning candidate besides simply counting ballot marks and either declaring the candidate with the most marks to be the winner</b> &#8212; as done in plurality voting, range voting, and approval voting &#8212; <b>or declaring the candidates with the fewest marks as deserving to be eliminated before another round of voting is conducted</b> &#8212; as done in runoff voting and instant-runoff voting.</p> 
<h1>Fusion Voting</h1> 
<p>Fusion voting simply consists of allowing the name of a candidate to appear more than once in a race because of having been nominated by more than one political party.</p> 
<p>During the late 1800s in the Western and Midwestern United States there were a number of minor political parties.&#160; These parties included the Progressives, Grangers, Populists, Independents, and Greenbackers.&#160; These parties were not large enough to support electable candidates, so they often nominated the same candidate as the Democratic party, or sometimes the candidate nominated by the Republican party.&#160; Republicans didn't like the perceived advantage of listing the Democratic candidate's name two or more times in the same race, so they attempted to abolish fusion voting.</p> 
<p>Eventually 41 states banned fusion voting.&#160; In 1997 the U.S. Supreme Court agreed that Minnesota's ban on fusion voting was constitutional.&#160; The Chief Justice, William Rehnquist, declared that states should be allowed to pass laws that &#8220;may, in practice, favor the traditional two-party system.&#8221; New York is one of the few states that still uses fusion voting.</p> 
<p>Is fusion voting fair?&#160; The answer is debatable.&#160; It is more appropriate to ask, &#8220;Is fusion voting a good way to accommodate minor political parties?&#8221;&#160; No it is not.&#160; There are far better ways to accommodate political agendas that lie beyond the agendas of the financially enhanced Republican and Democratic parties.</p> 
<h1>Declaration of Election-Method Reform Advocates</h1> 
<p>Some election-method experts promote the use of some of the voting methods explained in this chapter.&#160; To maintain fairness in explaining these alternate methods it's useful to convey those other opinions.</p> 
<p>Some election-method experts from around the world have written and signed a document titled the <i><b>Declaration of Election-Method Reform Advocates</b></i>.&#160; It requests that single-mark ballots be banned from all governmental elections, and it recommends four voting methods as replacements.&#160; The supported methods (in alphabetical order) are:</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Approval voting</b></li> 
<li>Any of the <b>Condorcet methods</b></li> 
<li><b>Majority judgment</b></li> 
<li><b>Range voting</b></li> 
</ul> 
<p>In later chapters you will learn about <b>VoteFair popularity ranking</b>, which is essentially the same method as the <b>Condorcet-Kemeny</b> method, which is one of the Condorcet methods that is specifically supported by the Declaration.&#160; In other words, the election-method experts who have signed this Declaration agree that VoteFair popularity ranking produces results that they agree are fair, and they recommend it, along with the other approved methods, for use in governmental elections.</p> 
<p>The Declaration states that the signers do not agree whether instant-runoff voting should be used in governmental elections.&#160; The method has both advantages and disadvantages, and the signers do not agree whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.</p> 
<p>Although the Declaration does not identify which voting methods should <i>not</i> be used for governmental elections, virtually all election-method experts agree that limited voting and the Borda-count method do not produce fair results and should not be used, even when the decision is relatively unimportant.</p> 
<p>In later chapters you will learn about <b>VoteFair representation ranking</b>, which is used to fill more than one seat, where the seats being filled are in a legislature or city council.&#160; Does the Declaration express support for this voting method?&#160; The Declaration expresses support for using voting methods that fill multiple seats in a legislature in proportional ways, which applies to VoteFair representation ranking.&#160; However the Declaration does not recommend any specific proportional methods.</p>

<h1>Peer-Reviewed Information About Voting Methods</h1> 
<p>The Wikipedia article titled <i>Voting System</i> is a valuable resource for learning about different voting methods.&#160; The article includes a table that summarizes advantages and disadvantages of significant voting methods.&#160; What makes this information special is that this table is peer-reviewed, which means that it lacks the bias of many other sources about voting methods.&#160; This neutrality allows you to validate for yourself the claims made in this book.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that the information in the comparison table is just a checklist that tracks which voting methods meet or fail which fairness criteria.&#160; This yes-or-no information does not <i>measure</i> how often, or how rarely, a method fails each fairness criterion.&#160; When meaningful <i>percentage</i>-failure measurements eventually become available, those measurements will reveal fairness far better than than simply counting how many fairness criteria each voting method fails.</p> 
<p>When reading about voting methods, keep in mind that many voting methods have multiple names.&#160; Also keep in mind that until recently some ballot types did not have names.&#160; Instead voting methods were named as if the ballot type and counting method were a single concept with a single name.&#160; In particular, the name <i>plurality voting</i> referred to both the ballot type and the counting method, and on the rare occasions when the ballot type needed to be mentioned, the name <i>plurality ballot</i> was sufficient.&#160; When the print edition of this book was published, the self-descriptive name <i>single-mark ballot</i> was introduced.</p> 
<p>Most news sources do not discuss election-method reform because it is more difficult to explain compared to the (oversimplified) conflict between Republicans and Democrats.&#160; A notable exception is <i>Democracy Chronicles</i>.&#160; It is an online newspaper that covers democracy-related news, including articles about election methods.&#160; (Disclosure: I, the author of this book, have contributed articles to <i>Democracy Chronicles</i>.)&#160; This online-only news source is at the DemocracyChronicles.com website.</p> 
<h1>What's Missing?</h1> 
<p>The alternate voting methods described in this chapter represent attempts to correctly identify which candidate is truly the most popular candidate in an election.&#160; As the Borda-count method and Condorcet voting suggest, a necessary ingredient for achieving this goal is to find out from each voter not only which candidate he or she prefers most, but also which candidate he or she prefers second-most, third-most, and so on.&#160; As Condorcet voting suggests, the other necessary ingredient is to correctly identify which candidate is most popular.&#160; In other words, getting fair results requires using the best combination of ballot type and counting method.</p> 
<p>In addition to the failure to reliably produce fair results, all the voting methods described in this and previous chapters also fail to achieve another ingredient needed for complete fairness.&#160; <b>The missing ingredient is a way to identify the overall second-most popular candidate, the overall third-most popular candidate, and so on</b>.&#160; Notice that plurality voting, instant-runoff voting, and the voting methods described in this chapter do not even attempt to identify the second-most popular candidate.</p> 
<p>The goal of identifying the overall order of preference for all candidates is referred to in academic literature as the principal of <i><b>universality</b></i>.&#160; The difficulty of achieving universality was promoted by a Nobel-prize-winning economist named Kenneth Arrow.&#160; He published a statement, which is commonly called Arrow's Theorem, that claims it is impossible for a voting method based on the counting and grouping of ballot marks to achieve all of several specific fairness criteria, one of which is universality.&#160; Many people have misunderstood his statement to imply that universality and other important fairness characteristics are impossible to achieve.</p> 
<p>In Part Three you will learn about a voting method called <i><b>VoteFair ranking</b></i> that was developed in the 1990s.&#160; This method not only correctly identifies the overall most-popular candidate, but it also correctly identifies the overall second-most popular candidate, the overall third-most popular candidate, and so on.</p> 
<p>The way VoteFair ranking achieves universality as well as other important fairness criteria without violating Arrow's Theorem is by limiting mathematically &#8220;unfair&#8221; results to cases that involve an uncommon pattern called <i>circular ambiguity</i>, which seldom happens when there are a large number of voters.</p> 
<p>Even when those unusual cases are included, <b>VoteFair ranking nearly always declares the winner to be the candidate who would be most likely to win a runoff election against any other candidate</b>.&#160; The methods described in this chapter do not achieve this level of fairness.</p> 
<p>VoteFair ranking involves more than just counting ballot marks, so it is significant that it was developed after computers became widely available.&#160; In contrast, <b>plurality voting, instant-runoff voting, and the voting methods described in this chapter were developed back when computers were not available</b>.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; If you are in a group of people who are using a show of hands to make a not-too-important choice, such as where to eat a meal, suggest using approval voting.&#160; In this method each person can raise their hand to express support for as many of the choices as they want, and the winner is whichever choice gets the highest count.</p> 
<p>If anyone recommends any of the other voting methods described in this chapter, agree that voters should be allowed to indicate not only their first choice, but also their second choice, third choice, and so on.&#160; Yet also point out that the method does not use the ballot information in a way that always produces fair results.</p>

<h1>Chapter 8:&#160; Hidden Dilemma:&#160; Why Do We Have Only Two Political Parties?</h1> 
<p>The existence of only two main political parties in the United States is an unintended consequence of the way Presidential elections are handled.&#160; Surprisingly there are unintended advantages to the two-party limit.&#160; In this chapter you will discover why the limit exists, what the advantages are, and how the goals of third parties can be achieved in spite of the two-party limit.</p> 
<h1>Why Third Parties Can't Win</h1> 
<p>Third political parties rarely win elections.&#160; Why?&#160; There are several reasons.&#160; One important barrier is that <b>it is impossible for a third-party candidate to win a Presidential election</b>, although not for the reason most people assume.</p> 
<p>To understand the barrier, consider the 2000 Presidential election between George W.&#160; Bush and Al Gore.&#160; Suppose the Green party candidate, Ralph Nader, had been popular enough to win the electoral votes of one or two medium-size states.&#160; That would have prevented both Bush and Gore from receiving a majority of electoral votes.&#160; What would have happened as a result?</p> 
<h1>Congress Would Really Choose The Next President?</h1> 
<p>The Twelfth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires a President to receive a majority of electoral votes in order to win.&#160; It also specifies that <b>if none of the candidates receives a majority of electoral votes, the decision for who will be the next President is turned over to the U.S. House of Representatives</b>.&#160; Yes, this means the members in the lower house of Congress would choose the next President!</p> 
<p>Almost all the members of the House of Representatives are Republicans and Democrats.&#160; Would they choose a third-party candidate?&#160; Of course not.&#160; They would not even consider choosing Green-party candidate Ralph Nader instead of Republican George W. Bush or Democrat Al Gore.&#160; Now you can appreciate why it is impossible for a third-party candidate to win a Presidential election.</p> 
<h1>One Vote For Each State</h1> 
<p>Even worse, the Twelfth Amendment specifies that if the House of Representatives chooses the next President, <b>each state gets just one vote</b>.&#160; The Twelfth Amendment does not specify how the Representatives from each state would reach an agreement about which candidate they, as the Representatives of the state, should vote for.&#160; This situation would produce significant conflicts, especially for the states whose Representatives are equally divided between Republicans and Democrats.</p> 
<p>Regardless of any attempts to make the outcome of such voting relatively fair, every voter in the United States would be annoyed that the decision was taken out of their hands.&#160; To put this another way, the unpopularity of using the intermediate voters called the Electoral College would be a minor nuisance compared to the unpopularity of turning over to the House of Representatives the choice of the next President.</p> 
<h1>Has It Happened In The Past?</h1> 
<p>Has the House of Representatives ever chosen a President because of the lack of an electoral-vote majority?&#160; Yes.&#160; It has happened twice.</p> 
<p>In 1800 the two Presidential candidates, Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr, each received the same number of electoral votes.&#160; The Twelfth Amendment had not yet been written, but the original U.S. Constitution also specifies that a tie-breaking decision be given to the House of Representatives.&#160; Voting there initially produced a tie and it took a couple of days for the tie to be broken in favor of Jefferson.</p> 
<p>In the 1800 Presidential election any concern about the House of Representatives choosing the President was overwhelmed by a bigger problem.&#160; The wording in the original Constitution basically specifies that the Presidential candidate who is second-most popular according to electoral votes becomes the Vice President.&#160; As a result, Aaron Burr became Vice President.&#160; This outcome was disastrous because Jefferson and Burr were political enemies.&#160; Before the next Presidential election the Twelfth Amendment was written and adopted.&#160; It solved the problem of incompatibility between the President and Vice President, but it preserved the existing method for resolving the lack of an electoral-vote majority.</p> 
<p>In 1824 there were four Presidential candidates who received electoral votes: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, William Crawford, and Henry Clay.&#160; As is typical when the vote is split, none of the candidates received a majority of electoral votes.&#160; The decision was turned over to the House of Representatives where the top three choices (Jackson, Adams, and Crawford) were voted on.&#160; The winner was John Quincy Adams.</p> 
<p>The breakdown in the 1824 Presidential election occurred because the four candidates were not clearly associated with political parties.&#160; All four were called Republicans, but they had political differences that were somewhat associated with the conflicts between the industrial Northern states, the agricultural Southern states, and the frontier Western states.</p> 
<p>To prevent the involvement of the House of Representatives in future Presidential elections, two new political parties were created.&#160; The two parties were the Democratic party and the National Republican party.&#160; In the following Presidential election the Democratic party nominated Andrew Jackson, the National Republican party nominated John Quincy Adams, and Andrew Jackson won the Presidency with a majority of electoral votes.</p> 
<p>Since then there have been changes in the nature of the two main political parties.&#160; The National Republican party lost popularity in the 1832 Presidential election and was basically replaced by the Whig party in the following Presidential election.&#160; The Whig party lost popularity in the 1852 Presidential election, and was basically replaced by the anti-slavery Republican party in the following Presidential election.&#160; Since 1824 there have been a number of Presidential elections in which the electoral votes have been split among three or more candidates, but those times have occurred when one of the candidates has been popular enough to win a majority of electoral votes.</p> 
<p>The lack of an electoral-vote majority almost occurred in the 2000 Presidential election between Bush and Gore.&#160; It would have happened if Florida had resolved its uncertain voting results by not giving its electoral votes to either candidate.&#160; In reality this scenario was unlikely, especially because the Governor of Florida was Bush's brother.</p> 
<h1>The Party's Over</h1> 
<p>Voters typically abandon weak political parties after the results of a Presidential election reveal the weakness of the party.&#160; For example, this happened to the National Republican party after the 1832 Presidential election, the Whig party after the 1852 Presidential election, and the Reform party after H.&#160; Ross Perot failed to win any electoral votes in the 1996 Presidential election.&#160; After the 2000 Presidential election voters abandoned the Green party because Ralph Nader failed to receive five percent of the popular vote, which would have made the Green party eligible for public campaign funds.</p> 
<p>It is important to understand that <b>the limiting of politics to two main political parties is done by the voters</b>.&#160; The Constitution does not establish any limit on the number of political parties.&#160; In fact, the Constitution does not even mention political parties, not even in any of its amendments.&#160; Also, none of the states have laws that explicitly limit the number of political parties.</p> 
<p>The abandonment of third parties does not occur because voters don't want to vote for third-party candidates.&#160; <b>The abandonment of third parties occurs because single-mark ballots do not allow a voter to indicate a preference between the Republican and Democratic candidates if the voter votes for a third-party candidate</b>.&#160; Even worse, voting for a third-party candidate increases the chances that the winner will be the candidate who the voter dislikes the most.</p> 
<p>The news media and campaign contributors are aware of the frightening possibility that none of the candidates will get a majority of electoral votes.&#160; This is partly why the news media neglects third-party Presidential candidates, and why major campaign contributors do not contribute money to third-party Presidential candidates.</p> 
<p><b>The voluntary limitation of U.S. elections to only two main political parties basically guarantees that one or the other of the Presidential candidates will receive a majority of electoral votes</b>.</p> 
<h1>No Majority Even Then</h1> 
<p>Many people believe the problem of Presidential candidates failing to receive a majority of electoral votes can be solved by eliminating the use of electoral votes.&#160; The commonly recommended alternative is to use direct voting, in which all the votes from all the voters throughout the United States are used directly.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately this change would not solve the problem.&#160; In fact, it would be even more difficult for a Presidential candidate to receive a majority of votes.&#160; As an example, in the 2000 Presidential election neither Bush nor Gore received a majority of direct votes.&#160; (Bush received slightly less than 48 percent, Gore received slightly more than 48 percent, and Nader received slightly less than three percent.)&#160; This lack of a majority would have thrown the decision into the House of Representatives, which would have been even less fair than what actually happened.</p> 
<p>The use of direct voting is not a solution because the lack of direct voting is not the problem.&#160; As previously explained, the source of the two-party limit is the use of single-mark ballots.&#160; Notice that <b>electoral votes are not involved in the two-party limit</b>.</p> 
<h1>Words That Take Control From The Voters</h1> 
<p>Let's take a look at the actual statement in the Constitution that acts as a barrier to third political parties.&#160; As you read the statement, notice there is not a single mention of political parties.&#160; Here are the relevant words in the Twelfth Amendment that govern us today.&#160; An explanation of it follows.</p> 
<p class="classQuote">&#8220;...&#160; The person having the greatest number of votes for President shall be the President, if such a number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have such majority, then from the persons having the highest numbers not exceeding three on the list of those voted for as President, the House of Representatives shall choose immediately, by ballot, the President.&#160; But in choosing the President, the votes shall be taken by states, the representation from each State having one vote; a quorum for this purpose shall consist of a member or members from two thirds of the states, and a majority of all the states shall be necessary to a choice.&#160; And if the House of Representatives shall not choose a President whenever the right of choice shall devolve upon them, before the fourth day of March next following, then the Vice President shall act as President, as in the case of the death or other constitutional disability of the President.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="classQuote">&#8220;The person having the greatest number of votes as Vice President shall be the Vice President, if such number be a majority of the whole number of Electors appointed; and if no person have a majority, then from the two highest numbers on the list the Senate shall choose the Vice President; a quorum for the purpose shall consist of two thirds of the whole number of Senators, and a majority of the whole number shall be necessary to a choice. ....&#8221;</p> 
<p>Explanation: If none of the Presidential candidates receives more than half the electoral votes, the House of Representatives chooses the President from among the three candidates having the most electoral votes.&#160; However, each state gets one vote.&#160; How the Representatives from each state combine their preferences into a single vote is not specified.&#160; In a similar yet separate way, the Senate would choose the Vice President.&#160; This separation could cause problems if the Senate dislikes the choice of President.&#160; The <b>quorum</b> references deal with how many Congressmen need to attend the special Congressional sessions, but with so much at stake and the speediest transportation no longer being by horseback, sparse attendance is unlikely.</p> 
<p>Do these words limit U.S. politics to only two main political parties?&#160; Not directly.&#160; Yet indirectly they do lead to a two-party limit.</p> 
<p>The limit occurs because <b>if none of the candidates receives a majority of votes, the use of single-mark ballots does not provide enough information to determine which candidate is really the most popular</b>.&#160; Without this information, and with the transportation and communication limitations of the early 1800s, there was only one way to resolve the situation in a reasonably fair way: turn the decision over to Congress.&#160; But times have changed.</p> 
<h1>State-By-State Reform</h1> 
<p>There is a way to bypass the need to amend the Constitution in order to improve Presidential elections.&#160; Multiple states can adopt an <i>interstate compact</i> that specifies which candidate gets the electoral votes from those states if, otherwise, the electoral votes would not elect the most popular candidate.&#160; The Constitution allows this approach because it allows states to determine who gets elected to the Electoral College.&#160; Congress would have to approve this interstate compact, but that's easier to accomplish than passing a Constitutional amendment.</p> 
<p>An agreement of this type named the <i><b>National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</b></i> has been passed in a few states, and it is being considered in other states.&#160; Unfortunately this particular agreement will cause more problems than it solves.&#160; It's designed to prevent a repeat of the 2000 Presidential election in which Al Gore received more popular votes than George W. Bush.&#160; For that reason it specifies that the electoral votes should go to the candidate who receives the <i>most</i> votes.&#160; Based on what you now know, it's obvious that this plurality-based approach can accidentally cause the wrong candidate to win.</p> 
<p>An even bigger problem is that it can be exploited through the use of money.&#160; To see how, consider that vote splitting between the Democratic candidate and the <i>liberal</i> third-party candidates would give the most votes to the Republican candidate, causing the Republican to win.&#160; This outcome is more likely than <i>conservative</i> third-party candidates splitting votes away from the Republican candidate.&#160; Why?&#160; Because conservative third parties are not as popular as liberal third parties, and whichever side has fewer candidates has the advantage.&#160; In addition, conservative campaign contributors have more money available to quietly fund spoiler candidates.&#160; This bias in favor of Republicans is ironic because most supporters of this reform are politically liberal.</p> 
<p>The underlying problem with the National Popular Vote Interstate Compact is that its supporters fail to understand that single-mark ballots do not provide enough information to know which candidate is really most popular.&#160; The long-term solution requires using ballots that collect additional preference information.&#160; (Another complication, which is explained in Chapter 10, is that a vote in one state is not equivalent to a vote in a different state.)</p> 
<p>Could a different interstate compact be designed to work with our existing single-mark ballots?&#160; Yes, as a temporary fix.&#160; The agreement would invite each Presidential candidate to designate, in advance, their order of preference for the other candidates in the race.&#160; This publicly available order-of-preference information would be used to support a voter who marks the name of a third-party candidate.&#160; After the ballots have been cast, the third-party candidate who has the fewest popular votes would be eliminated, and that candidate's votes would shift to the next candidate on that candidate's list.&#160; More third-party candidates would be eliminated in the same way.&#160; As needed a voter's vote would shift to the next candidate in the marked candidate's list.&#160; Notice that the candidates, not the voters, get to specify the order of preference, which makes this method different from instant-runoff voting.&#160; If all the minor candidates designate a full list of other candidates, then this arrangement would eliminate vote splitting.&#160; From the voter's perspective, a voter could finally express support for a third-party candidate in a way that ends up supporting the more similar of the two main candidates.</p> 
<p>There is danger in this approach.&#160; It would end the two-party limit.&#160; In fact, most voters, instead of voting for the Republican and Democratic candidates, might choose to vote for third-party candidates.&#160; In that case a third-party candidate could easily become President.&#160; Although that may sound appealing, it is not yet safe to remove the two-party limit.&#160; The reason, which involves the way voting is done in Congress, is explained later in this chapter.</p> 
<h1>Third Parties Fail, But Their Issues May Live On</h1> 
<p>Obviously third political parties exist even though they cannot win a Presidential election, rarely get any of their candidates elected to Congress, and seldom get their candidates elected to state legislatures.&#160; So what role do third political parties play?&#160; </p> 
<p><b>Third parties provide a way to popularize a particular political agenda</b>.&#160; If a third-party agenda is popular enough, the third party begins to get some of its candidates elected.&#160; The growing success of a third party usually occurs at the expense of one of the two main parties.&#160; To prevent the further weakening of the affected main party, the affected main party is likely to adopt the agenda of the third party.&#160; This adoption usually leads to the agenda getting implemented as a new law.&#160; Such success ironically leads to the abandonment of the third party.</p> 
<p>An example of a successful third political party was the Prohibition party.&#160; Its agenda was to outlaw alcoholic beverages.&#160; The Prohibition party offered Presidential candidates in four Presidential elections (1884 through 1896), and these candidates received enough votes to demonstrate the popularity of the agenda, although not enough votes to win a single electoral vote.&#160; Politicians in both of the main parties eventually supported the agenda enough to adopt (in 1919) the Eighteenth Amendment that started the era of Prohibition.&#160; The inability to enforce this law led to its repeal (in 1933).</p> 
<p>Here are other examples of political agendas that were made popular by third political parties, and then later implemented with support from one or both of the two main parties.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The direct election of U.S. Senators (instead of allowing state legislatures to choose U.S. Senators).&#160; The Seventeenth Amendment implemented this change.</li> 
<li>The direct election of judges (instead of allowing judges to be appointed)</li> 
<li>Farm subsidies</li> 
<li>The progressive income tax (which is higher tax rates for higher incomes)</li> 
<li>Railroad and bank regulations (to prevent unfair practices that were commonly used by railroads and banks)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Of course there have been third political parties with agendas that never became popular with the two main parties.&#160; The Communist party (in the United States) is an example of such a third party.</p> 
<p>The popularity of the Green party's Presidential candidate, Ralph Nader, in the 2000 Presidential election demonstrated a growing popularity for both environmental protection and reduced influence of campaign contributions in politics.&#160; The degree to which the Republican and Democratic parties have adjusted their agendas in these directions is not yet clear, but some shifts have occurred.</p> 
<p>The survival of the Republican and Democratic parties is not jeopardized by the existence of third political parties.&#160; Instead third parties exist to remind everyone of specific ways in which the Republican and Democratic parties do not represent the political agendas of some voters.&#160; The use of single-mark ballots and the need for strategic voting prevents us from knowing how popular third-party agendas actually are.</p> 
<h1>Fewer Parties, More Influence</h1> 
<p><b>The two-party monopoly dramatically increases the influence of campaign contributions</b>.&#160; With only two main political parties, campaign contributors can easily afford to influence both of them.</p> 
<p><b>If the two-party monopoly did not exist and a third party was a viable alternative, frustrated voters would simply abandon the money-influenced parties and create a new political party that was not heavily dependent on large campaign contributions</b>.&#160; If that happened the Republican and Democratic parties would be motivated to reduce their money-influenced agendas so that voters would be attracted back to these parties.</p> 
<h1>Another Two-Party Limit</h1> 
<p>Are two dominant political parties enough?&#160; It depends.&#160; If they are representative of the voters, two political parties in the United States is a good choice &#8212; for a reason that is often overlooked.</p> 
<p>Suppose elections were handled in a way that allowed a voter to indicate a third-party candidate as a first choice, and either a Republican or Democratic candidate as a second choice.&#160; And suppose election outcomes correctly identified which candidate is truly most popular.&#160; And suppose Presidential elections never ended up in the hands of Congress.&#160; Under these conditions, it would be possible for three or four major parties to exist in the United States.&#160; Would this situation produce fair results?&#160; Surprisingly no.</p> 
<p>Consider what would happen in Congress if there were three or four main political parties.&#160; It is unlikely that any of the parties would have a majority in Congress.&#160; As a result, bills would not be approved because the members of each party would vote for their own bills and against the bills of the other parties.&#160; Soon the members of Congress would arrange to trade votes with members in other parties.&#160; Then vote-trading alliances would develop.&#160; Eventually these alliances would occur most often between specific parties, and that would lead to the formation of coalitions.&#160; This is the path that has already been taken by politicians in parliamentary countries.</p> 
<p>Why can't coalitions be avoided?&#160; <b>The voting methods used within Congress and Parliaments are just as unfair as the plurality-based and runoff-based voting methods used to elect the members of Congress and Parliaments</b>.&#160; The limitations of these voting methods account for why coalitions are needed when there is not a single political party that has a majority of members.</p> 
<h1>Rolling Logs And Vote Trading</h1> 
<p>Let's take a closer look at how voting is done within Congress.&#160; One of the techniques used in Congress is known as vote trading.&#160; As the name implies, this technique consists of two Congressmen agreeing to trade votes on two different bills.&#160; The fact that each of the two Congressmen must vote in favor of a bill they don't really want is simply the price they pay to gain support for the bill they strongly support.</p> 
<p>Another technique used in Congress is known as logrolling.&#160; This technique consists of combining into a single bill various laws that are preferred by various Congressional members.</p> 
<p>As a simple example of logrolling, suppose the states of California, Texas, and Florida each want federal funds to pay for a major construction project in their state.&#160; If approval for the federal funds were split up into three separate bills, the Congressmen would each vote in favor of the bill for the project in their own state, and would tend to vote against the bills for projects in other states.&#160; Logrolling combines these three independent decisions into a single bill.&#160; As a result, the Representatives from California, Texas, and Florida all vote in favor of the combined bill.&#160; These votes alone would not be enough to get the bill passed, but the bill could be expanded to include federal funds for yet other projects in other states, and vote trading could be used to arrange the additional needed votes.</p> 
<p>Notice that vote trading involves more than one bill, whereas logrolling involves a single bill.</p> 
<p>To appreciate the primitive nature of logrolling and vote trading, consider how decisions in Congress are likely to be negotiated in the distant future.&#160; Eventually the negotiations will be formalized as a voting method that integrates the compromising that forms the core of logrolling and vote trading.&#160; A prototype for this kind of voting is demonstrated at <i><b>NegotiationTool.com</b></i>.&#160; (This voting method was designed and implemented after the print edition of this book was published.)</p> 
<p>How will this kind of voting work?&#160; Each Congressman will vote digitally in a way that indicates whether he or she supports or opposes each proposed portion of a large bill.&#160; Controversial issues would be split into separate proposals, with each Congressman being allowed to offer specific proposals.&#160; In addition, each Congressman would indicate how strongly he or she supports or opposes each of the proposals.&#160; The more strongly the Congressman expresses support or opposition about an issue, the less strongly he or she can express support or opposition about other issues in the bill.&#160; Computer software combines all these rankings into a list of proposals that are recommended for inclusion in the final bill.&#160; In reaction, at any time, Congressmen would adjust their votes.&#160; When vote changing has calmed down and a majority of Congressmen indicate their approval of the overall bill, Congressional leaders can submit the bill for a vote and know that it is likely to pass.&#160; This process could handle more than seven political parties, which is more than politicians can handle in a fair way.</p> 
<p>In the meantime, <b>the existing voting methods used in Congress do not accommodate more than two main political parties</b>.</p> 
<p>Are two main parties sufficient to represent most voters?&#160; The answer depends on whether voters have a way to vote around either of the two main parties if one of the parties fails to be representative of what voters want.&#160; Currently voters do not have a reasonable way to vote around the two main parties, so lots of voters currently believe that third parties are strongly needed.</p> 
<h1>Barrier Waves</h1> 
<p>There is another barrier to third political parties worth considering.&#160; It is the high cost of television and radio advertising.&#160; However, it is currently pointless to remove this barrier.&#160; Why?&#160; Because many of the votes for third-party candidates are for the purpose of expressing displeasure with the Republican and Democratic parties.&#160; When the voting methods explained in Part Three are adopted, the Republican and Democratic parties will be directly motivated to be much more responsive to the desires of voters, and then it won't be necessary to express displeasure by voting for third-party candidates.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>Based on what you learned in this chapter, point out to interested friends or relatives that we have only two main political parties in the United States because a popular third-party Presidential candidate would put the choice of the next President into the hands of Congress.</p> 
<p>If someone says that electoral votes are the problem, point out that the lack of a majority is even more likely if direct votes are used instead of electoral votes.&#160; (Read Chapter 10 for more information about direct versus electoral votes.)</p> 
<p>If someone expresses support for the <i>National Popular Vote Interstate Compact</i>, ask them what will happen if a liberal third-party candidate splits votes away from the Democratic candidate so that the Republican candidate gets the most votes.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 9:&#160; Imbalanced Tyranny:&#160; Why Party-Balancing Games Yield Imbalanced Results</h1> 
<p>One of the most important political struggles occurs quietly, out of the spotlight.&#160; In this chapter you will learn why the Republican and Democratic parties fight over the location of Congressional-district boundaries.&#160; What's at stake?&#160; Control of Congress.</p> 
<h1>Tipping The Balance</h1> 
<p>The previous chapters in Part Two have focused on the unfair voting methods that are used to elect a single official such as a President or Governor.&#160; Now let's focus on unfair methods that are used to alter the balance of power in a legislature.&#160; Keep in mind that the term <b>legislature</b> applies to Congress as well as state legislatures.</p> 
<p>Why is the balance of power in a legislature so important?&#160; Because whichever political party has a majority of elected officials in a legislature can pass laws in spite of opposition from the other party.&#160; In addition, whichever party is the majority party typically gets to have its members be the chairmen of every committee.</p> 
<p>To see what this means, consider the situation that existed in the U.S. Senate after the year 2000 election.&#160; At that time the Senate was exactly balanced with 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats.&#160; Tie-breaking votes from the Republican Vice President, Dick Cheney, gave control of the Senate to the Republican party.</p> 
<p>In 2001 Republican Senator James Jeffords (from Vermont) decided to switch parties and officially become an independent (no party affiliation) and unofficially cooperate with the agendas of the Democratic party.&#160; What happened as a consequence?&#160; Suddenly a Democrat took over as the majority leader, and the chairmanship of all 20 Senate committees had to be renegotiated.&#160; This change allowed Democrats to take over as chairmen of the Senate committees.&#160; To appreciate the importance of this shift in power, remember that committees write the proposed laws and Congressmen can only vote in favor of, or against, these proposed laws.</p> 
<p>This historic situation prompts us to ask, &#8220;What determines the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats in Congress?&#8221; It's important to realize that <b>the balance of power in Congress does not necessarily match the preferences of the voters throughout the United States</b>.&#160; This unfairness is well-known among politicians and students of political science.&#160; This is why many democracies use proportional representation; it ensures that the number of parliamentary seats occupied by each political party matches the proportion of voters who prefer each political party.</p> 
<p>To further convey the importance of the imbalance in Congress, consider what went on in Texas during the summer of 2003.&#160; The state legislature in Texas consists of a majority of Republicans.&#160; Taking advantage of this situation, the Republican party passed legislation in Texas that changed the Congressional district boundaries within Texas in favor of the Republican party.&#160; Some of the Democrats in the Texas state legislature delayed the new legislation by living in motels across the border in Oklahoma, where they couldn't be retrieved by Texas law-enforcement officers.&#160; This left the legislature without enough legislators to allow this, or any other, legislation to be voted on.&#160; Of course this dramatic tactic came to an end, but the absurdity of this situation reveals the importance of district-boundary locations.</p> 
<p>The revised Congressional boundaries in Texas increased the number of Congressional districts in Texas that elected Republican Congressmen in the 2004 election, and decreased the number of Democrats in Congress.&#160; The result increased by several seats the margin by which the Republican party currently controls the House of Representatives.</p> 
<h1>Playing Games With District Boundaries</h1> 
<p>The manipulation of district boundaries to favor a political party is done so often it has a name: <i><b>gerrymandering</b></i>.&#160; The name was created by a newspaper editor reacting to a political cartoon that showed a strangely shaped district that looked somewhat like a salamander, and Gerry Elbridge was the Massachusetts Governor who was (mistakenly) blamed for the redistricting.</p> 
<p><b>The goal of gerrymandering is to choose the location of boundaries between districts in a way that increases the number of winners from the desired political party and reduces the number of winners from the opposing political party</b>.&#160; Remember that these increases and decreases refer to seats in a legislature.</p> 
<p>Does gerrymandering really work?&#160; You betcha!&#160; <b>In general elections, the outcome in most Congressional districts is very predictable in terms of whether a Republican or Democrat will win</b>.&#160; Out of the 435 seats in the House of Representatives, fewer than 50 seats are regarded as actually competitive.&#160; Expressed another way, the political-party outcome for about 350 Congressional races is predictable even without considering any information about the candidates.</p> 
<p>The situation in Pennsylvania demonstrates the unfairness of gerrymandering.&#160; This state has more registered Democrats than Republicans, yet out of Pennsylvania's 19 seats in the House of Representatives, 12 of these Representatives are Republicans and only seven are Democrats.&#160; Republicans control the Pennsylvania state legislature, so naturally they choose Congressional-district boundaries that favor Republican candidates.</p> 
<p>To understand why the location of district boundaries can affect election results, let's look at an example.&#160; In this example let's suppose Ohio elects 10 members to the House of Representatives.&#160; (Ohio actually elects 20 Representatives.)&#160; This means the Congressional district boundaries must define 10 districts.</p> 
<p>To keep the numbers simple, let's imagine that the state of Ohio has only 100 citizens, every one of them is a registered voter, and they all vote in every election.&#160; (Yes, it is highly unrealistic to assume every registered voter votes in every election.)&#160; An important requirement for district boundaries is that each district must contain approximately the same number of voters.&#160; So in this example, each district must have 10 voters.</p> 
<p>As for party preferences, let's suppose 60 of the Ohio voters always vote for Republican candidates and the other 40 voters always vote for Democratic candidates.&#160; Here is a map that shows the location of the voters, and shading indicates each voter's party preference.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_188_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 188" width="580" height="657"/></p> 
<p>How would the Republican party want to draw the district boundaries?&#160; They would create districts that contain six Republicans and four Democrats in each district.&#160; The map below shows how the boundaries could be drawn to create 10 such districts.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_189_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 189" width="580" height="723"/></p> 
<p>Using these district boundaries each and every district would elect a Republican candidate.&#160; In other words, all 10 of the Ohio Representatives would be Republicans.</p> 
<p>How would the Democratic party want to draw the district boundaries?&#160; In this example there are not enough Democratic voters to allow the Democrats to win in every district, so they would use two well-known gerrymandering strategies.</p> 
<p>The first strategy of the Democratic party would be to pack as many Republican voters as possible into the districts the party counts on losing.&#160; This strategy is called packing.&#160; In this example the district lines could be drawn to create four districts that each contain nine Republicans and one Democrat.&#160; As few Democrats as possible are put into these districts because they are needed for winning elections in other districts.&#160; In each of the four packed districts a Republican candidate would win with an overwhelming majority.</p> 
<p>The other gerrymandering strategy is called cracking.&#160; This strategy consists of splitting up the remaining Republicans so that none of the remaining six districts would contain enough Republicans to outvote the Democrats.&#160; Specifically, there would be six districts that each contain six Democrats and four Republicans.&#160; These districts would each elect a Democratic candidate.&#160; These elections would be won with a comfortable, but not an overwhelming, majority.</p> 
<p>The map below shows how the boundaries could be drawn to create the 10 districts preferred by the Democratic party.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_191_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 191" width="558" height="750"/></p> 
<p>What would the overall election results be using the boundaries preferred by the Democratic party?&#160; Six of the 10 Representatives would be Democrats and the other four would be Republicans.</p> 
<p>Notice the dramatic contrast between these two results.&#160; If the boundaries designed by the Republican party were used, the 60 Republican voters would be represented by 10 Republican Representatives, and the 40 Democratic voters would not be represented by a single Democratic Representative.&#160; If the boundaries designed by the Democratic party were used, the 40 Democratic voters would be represented by six Democratic Representatives, and the 60 Republican voters would be represented by only four Republican Representatives.&#160; In other words, a change in the district boundaries can affect four out of the 10 Ohio seats.</p> 
<p>Let's compare these party-biased results with ideally fair results.&#160; Ideally the 60 Republican voters should be represented by six Republican Representatives, and the 40 Democratic voters should be represented by four Democratic Representatives.&#160; In other words, <b>when the results are completely fair, the number of seats won by each party at least roughly matches the proportion of voters who prefer each party</b>.</p> 
<p>Now you have a better appreciation for why the Republican and Democratic parties struggle to influence the positions of district boundaries.&#160; <b>Gerrymandering</b> is very powerful because it <b>can change the balance of power in a legislature without changing the opinions of voters</b>.&#160; An added advantage is that it does not require much money.</p> 
<p>Another advantage for campaign contributors is that <b>knowing in advance whether a Congressional seat will be won by a Republican or Democrat makes it easy for campaign contributors to target their contributions efficiently, without wasting money where the results are unlikely to change</b>.</p> 
<h1>Marking A Party's Territory</h1> 
<p>How are Congressional district boundaries chosen?&#160; To start with, every 10 years the U.S. census counts citizens to determine where they are living.&#160; Based on this information some calculations are done in Washington DC.&#160; The goal is to ensure that, within reason, each Representative in the House of Representatives represents roughly the same number of citizens.&#160; The resulting numbers indicate how many seats each state gets in the U.S. House of Representatives.</p> 
<p>Each state legislature is responsible for choosing the boundaries of the Congressional districts within its state.&#160; A fundamental requirement is that each Congressional district must include approximately the same number of citizens as the other districts in the same state.&#160; Also there are federal laws that prevent the most obvious forms of gerrymandering.&#160; As an example, a district cannot consist of two separate areas that are connected by a thin path between them.&#160; Usually the new boundaries are similar to the previous ones, but the changes may be more dramatic if there have been dramatic shifts in the distribution of the citizens within the state.</p> 
<p>The Republican and Democratic parties each hire experts to draw proposed boundaries that favor their political party.&#160; Of course the recommended boundaries from each party are incompatible, so a few legislators from each party negotiate compromised boundaries that are presented to the state legislature for voting.&#160; Each step of the backroom negotiation process is backed by advice from the hired experts.</p> 
<p>If specific Congressional boundaries are clearly unfair, the U.S. Supreme Court can require the boundaries to be changed.&#160; For this reason gerrymandering is done at a subtle level rather than being done in obvious ways.</p> 
<p><b>During the negotiations</b> for a state's Congressional district boundaries, <b>the Republican and Democratic parties usually arrange the boundaries in ways that will produce predictable election results</b>.&#160; Specifically the negotiations involve trade-offs such as, &#8220;We will let the Republicans win in those districts, so that the Democrats can win in these districts.&#8221;</p> 
<p>You now know that <b>the Republican and Democratic parties arrange, in advance, which districts will elect Republican candidates to Congress and which districts will elect Democratic candidates</b>.&#160; Now you can better appreciate why the outcomes of most Congressional elections are so easy to predict.</p> 
<p>There are even districts that are intentionally designed for electing a specific politician.&#160; This is why some well-known Congressmen are easily reelected every term, decade after decade.&#160; Naturally the voters in these districts who favor the opposite political party get very discouraged.</p> 
<h1>What Determines The Overall Balance?</h1> 
<p>Why don't the Republican and Democratic parties choose boundaries that allow voters to decide which party's candidate wins in each district?&#160; For two reasons.&#160; First, many states contain a majority of voters who prefer the candidates of a particular party, and that makes it impossible to create balanced districts throughout the state.&#160; Second, uncertainty in the outcome of elections in each district introduces too much uncertainty in the overall results.</p> 
<p>To better understand the second reason, imagine what would happen if the general election in every Congressional district throughout the United States involved an uncertain outcome.&#160; Every two years the House of Representatives would change dramatically in terms of the number of Republicans and Democrats.&#160; In one Congressional session there might be 150 Republicans and 285 Democrats, and in the next Congressional session these numbers could be reversed so that there are 285 Republicans and 150 Democrats.&#160; To make matters worse, each election result would reflect voter-registration and voter-turnout issues, rather than reflecting the political preferences of citizens.</p> 
<p>Now we arrive at an important point.&#160; <b>The balance of power in Congress between Republicans and Democrats is based on backroom negotiations in state legislatures throughout the United States</b>.&#160; Considering how Congressional boundaries are chosen, <b>it is almost surprising that the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats in Congress roughly matches the nationwide balance in popularity between the Republican and Democratic parties</b>.&#160; The fact that there is somewhat of a balance in Congress occurs because the judicial system, especially the U.S. Supreme Court, ensures that the Congressional boundary choices are reasonable.</p> 
<p>Most citizens assume the balance of power in Congress is determined by voters casting their ballots.&#160; Now you know that the power balance in Congress is actually determined quietly, in advance of the elections, in backroom negotiations between the Republican and Democratic parties, and in difficult-to-understand courtroom cases.</p> 
<h1>Strategic Cascade Of Power</h1> 
<p>When a state legislature chooses new Congressional boundaries, the balance between Republicans and Democrats in that legislature affects the outcome.&#160; For example, if more than half the legislators in a state legislature are Republicans, they usually outvote the Democratic legislators and approve boundaries that favor Republicans in Congressional races.</p> 
<p>What affects the balance between Republican and Democratic parties in a state legislature?&#160; Obviously the balance is affected by the state's balance between Republican voters and Democratic voters.&#160; Less obviously, the balance is affected by the boundaries that define the districts from which the state legislators are elected.&#160; In other words, gerrymandering occurs in choosing state legislative districts.&#160; Who chooses these boundaries?&#160; The state legislature.</p> 
<p>Now you can see a pattern emerging.&#160; The Republican and Democratic parties fight for advantages in legislative-district boundaries in hopes of winning the balance of power in each state's legislature.&#160; In turn, winning the balance of power in many states makes it easier for a party to influence Congressional boundaries in these states.&#160; These advantages in Congressional district boundaries can then shift the balance of power in the U.S. House of Representatives.&#160; In other words, the gerrymandering of seemingly unimportant state-level legislative-district boundaries can lead to the gerrymandering of Congressional district boundaries that, in turn, affect the balance of power in Congress.</p> 
<h1>Two-Party Proportional Representation?</h1> 
<p>Many European countries avoid the unfairness of gerrymandering by using the voting method called proportional representation, which you learned about in Chapter 4.&#160; This method makes sure the percentage of winning candidates from each party matches the percentage of voters who prefer that party.&#160; When this approach is used, gerrymandering becomes ineffective.&#160; In fact, it makes the location of district boundaries irrelevant in terms of affecting the balance of power in Parliament.&#160; This big benefit is what motivates so many democracies to adopt proportional representation.</p> 
<p>Is it possible to create a two-party version of proportional representation, without adopting the undesirable characteristics of proportional representation?&#160; Yes.</p> 
<p>Consider the Ohio example in which 60 Republican voters and 40 Democratic voters are represented by 10 Representatives in the House of Representatives.&#160; Two-party proportional representation would ensure that six of the Representatives are Republicans and four of the Representatives are Democrats.</p> 
<p>A two-party version of proportional representation would not be suitable for adjusting the balance of power between the Republicans and Democrats in Congress.&#160; Why?&#160; Because that would require linking the results of Congressional elections in one state with the results of Congressional elections in another state.&#160; <b>As the writers of the Constitution wisely recognized, each state should choose for itself the details of how Congressional elections are handled</b>.</p> 
<h1>Cross-Party Preferences</h1> 
<p>There is yet another disadvantage of proportional representation that becomes important in this context of balancing power in Congress.&#160; Proportional representation requires voters to mark on their ballot which political party they prefer most.&#160; Yet most voters have cross-party preferences.&#160; To better appreciate these preferences, here are simplified profiles of actual voters.&#160; Notice that their preferences would not be revealed regardless of whether they mark the Republican party or the Democratic party as their preferred party.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>A labor-union member (Democratic orientation) who is a fundamentalist Christian (Republican orientation)</li> 
<li>A wife of a business owner (Republican orientation) who is concerned about protecting water and air from pollution (Democratic orientation)</li> 
<li>A divorced mother who wants government assistance with child care (Democratic orientation) and who is strongly against abortions (Republican orientation)</li> 
<li>An accountant who is fiscally conservative (Republican orientation) and who believes an adult woman should have the right to choose whether to get an abortion (Democratic orientation)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Of course each of these voters could choose between the two parties when asked which they prefer.&#160; But would the resulting numbers reveal their political orientations?&#160; Of course not.&#160; Yet proportional representation blindly matches voters with representatives based on political-party labels.</p> 
<p>The importance of cross-party voting reveals that, <b>even if party-based proportional representation in Congress could be achieved, Congressional decisions would frequently be different from what voters would decide if they could directly vote on Congressional bills</b>.</p> 
<h1>Voting For Candidates Or Parties?</h1> 
<p>Earlier you learned that European versions of proportional representation (that accommodate more than two main political parties) result in unfairness, and now you have learned that two-party proportional representation would also fail to produce fair results.&#160; What's left?</p> 
<p>The problem with both versions of proportional representation is they give power to a political party without also enabling voters to fully choose the elected politicians in that party.&#160; What's needed is to increase the fairness of primary elections so that voters &#8212; not big campaign contributors &#8212; fully control the political parties through a fairer candidate-selection process.&#160; <b>Through increased fairness in choosing the winners of primary elections, voters will be able to increasingly influence the agendas of the Republican and Democratic parties</b>.&#160; Until a majority of voters are truly represented by the Republican and Democratic parties, it's relatively pointless to ask voters to officially indicate their party preferences for the purpose of proportional representation.</p> 
<h1>Tyranny Of The Minority</h1> 
<p>Suppose somehow the members of Congress exactly matched U.S. citizens nationwide in terms of all political preferences, not just political-party preferences.&#160; Would the decisions made in Congress be completely fair?&#160; No.</p> 
<p>Consider that for the purpose of passing a new law, 51 Senators and 218 Representatives can outvote the remaining 49 Senators and 217 Representatives in Congress.&#160; Expressed in broader terms this means <b>majority-based voting within Congress allows 51 percent of a population to tell the other 49 percent what they can and cannot do</b>.&#160; This majority rule, which is sometimes called the tyranny of the majority, is a weakness in the cornerstone of commonly used forms of democracy.</p> 
<p>To better appreciate this weakness, consider this quote from James Boward: &#8220;Democracy must be something more than two wolves and a sheep voting on what to have for dinner.&#8221; From this perspective voting in the U.S. Senate can be as unfair as 51 wolves and 49 sheep voting &#8212; on anything.</p> 
<p>The concept of majority rule is rooted in the notion that if two groups of people are in a conflict, whichever group has more people is likely to win if a fight breaks out.&#160; From this perspective voting is basically a way of counting the number of people on each side so that the winning side can be identified without resorting to fighting.&#160; This view of majority rule reveals it to be unexpectedly primitive.</p> 
<p>The fact that majority-based decisions can lead to tyranny over a minority has motivated some groups of people to adopt consensus decision-making.&#160; In the consensus approach everyone at a meeting must agree to a change before the change is adopted.&#160; Although consensus decisions are very fair, reaching a consensus is typically difficult and often impossible.&#160; In addition, a consensus approach easily enables an uncooperative person to make demands each time a decision must be made.&#160; For these reasons consensus-based decision-making is not practical in government situations.&#160; Yet its existence, and its occasional use, reveals a frequently overlooked unfairness of majority rule.</p> 
<p>Who is represented by the majority of Congressmen?&#160; Although many people would answer this question by looking at the number of Republicans and Democrats in Congress, remember that countless voters are not represented by either the Republican or Democratic party, and both parties are heavily influenced by the biggest campaign contributors.&#160; As a result, the majority of Congressmen actually represent a minority of U.S. citizens.&#160; This fact leads to what can be called the tyranny of the minority.</p> 
<p>How big is this minority that controls Congress?&#160; Answering this question requires detailed information about the roles of all the people who are responsible for the decisions that control the biggest campaign contributions.&#160; The identity of these people and their roles would be extremely difficult to determine.&#160; Yet we can make a rough estimate based on the fact that roughly 20 percent of the U.S. population owns about 80 percent of its wealth.&#160; On this basis it is reasonable to estimate that all the members of Congress represent no more than 40 percent of the U.S. citizens who are eligible to vote.&#160; Only half the members of Congress need to approve a new law, so <b>only about 20 percent of all U.S. citizens are represented by the half of Congress that approves each new law</b>.</p> 
<p>We now see that instead of 51 percent of the voters getting to tell the other 49 percent what they can and cannot do, <b>a minority of less than 20 percent of citizens get to tell the other 80 percent what they can and cannot do</b>.</p> 
<p>This tyranny of the minority clarifies why balancing political parties to match voter preferences can still lead to unfair decisions being made in Congress.&#160; The unfairness comes from two sources.&#160; First, <b>the majority of citizens whose Congressmen are in the minority of Congress cannot pass legislation they want, and they cannot block legislation they don't want</b>.&#160; Second, <b>the heavy influence of campaign contributions causes the Congressmen who are in the majority to represent only a minority of voters</b>.</p> 
<h1>Senatorial Dilemma</h1> 
<p>With each state having only two Senators, it's difficult to match these two Senators with the state's voters and citizens.&#160; After all, there are only three likely possibilities: both Senators are Republicans, or both Senators are Democrats, or there is one Senator from each party.</p> 
<p>To better understand this difficulty in choosing how to elect Senators, let's again consider the simplified example involving 60 Republican voters and 40 Democratic voters in Ohio.&#160; Keeping in mind that the Constitution requires Senators from the same state to be elected in different years, let's suppose all the voters participate in electing both Senators.&#160; The 60 Republican voters would outvote the 40 Democratic voters in every Senatorial election, and both Senators would be Republicans.&#160; Here is a map that shows this situation.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_200_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 200" width="580" height="724"/></p> 
<p>Some states divide the state into two Senatorial districts, and then the people in each district elect just one of the two Senators.&#160; In other words, each half of the state chooses a Senator independently of the other half of the state.&#160; In this case the outcome depends on the location of the boundary between the two districts.</p> 
<p>In the simplified Ohio example, suppose the boundary is chosen so that each Senatorial district contains 30 Republican voters and 20 Democratic voters.&#160; With this boundary, both Senators would be Republicans.&#160; Here is a map that shows this situation.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_201_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 201" width="580" height="724"/></p> 
<p>It is also possible to locate the boundary so that one Senatorial district contains 24 Republican voters and 26 Democratic voters.&#160; The Senator elected from this district would be a Democrat.&#160; The other Senator would be a Republican because that district would contain the remaining 36 Republican voters and 14 Democratic voters.&#160; Here is a map that shows a district boundary that fits this description.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_202_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 202" width="553" height="750"/></p> 
<p>Which outcome is more representative?&#160; Two Republican Senators?&#160; Or one Republican Senator and one Democratic Senator?&#160; Neither outcome is particularly representative.&#160; If both Senators are Republicans, the 40 Democratic voters are not represented at all, and the 60 Republican voters are represented by two Senators.&#160; If the two Senators are from different parties, the Republican Senator represents 60 voters, and the Democratic Senator represents 40 voters.</p> 
<p>Of these two outcomes in this example, having one Senator from each political party is a better match.&#160; After all, the numbers 60 and 40 are both close to 50, and if there were 50 Republican voters and 50 Democratic voters, the match would be exactly proportional.&#160; Ironically this better match requires a very convoluted boundary between the two Senatorial districts.</p> 
<p>Would European methods of proportional representation be helpful?&#160; No, those methods cannot be used because they require at least five seats to provide proportional results.</p> 
<h1>Balancing U.S. Senators?</h1> 
<p>Is there a way to elect U.S. Senators with little or no unfairness?&#160; The first step in answering this question is to recognize that <b>the overall balance between Republicans and Democrats in the U.S. Senate is more important than proportional representation from each state</b>.&#160; In other words, the issue about determining the political party of each of the two Senators from a state is not as important as making sure the balance of power between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate matches, or at least mostly matches, the nationwide popularity of these two parties.</p> 
<p>Suppose the two Senators from each state were required to be from different political parties.&#160; Each state would have one Republican Senator and one Democratic Senator.&#160; Overall the U.S. Senate would consist of 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats.</p> 
<p>Obviously an exact balance between Republicans and Democrats in the Senate would be criticized as creating a stalemate.&#160; The absence of either party having a majority would lead to fewer bills getting passed.&#160; Yet this is not an unfairness.&#160; A Senate comprised of 50 Republicans and 50 Democrats would easily pass the truly important bills that a majority of voters support.&#160; A stalemate would occur only for changes that a majority of voters don't really want, which usually applies to conflicts between the biggest contributors of one party and the biggest contributors of the other party.&#160; Anyway, a true stalemate would be easy to break because the Vice President can add a tie-breaking vote.</p> 
<p>Ironically, a balanced Senate would be fairer than the current approach of switching power back and forth between the Republican and Democratic parties every few years.&#160; These shifts in power do not reflect large changes in the political opinions of voters.&#160; Instead they reflect small changes in party-based election strategies.</p> 
<p>A more valid criticism of a balanced Senate is that it complicates the choice of committee and subcommittee chairmen.&#160; An exact balance between Senators would lead to the Vice President adding a tie-breaking vote, and all the chairmanships would go to Senators from the same party as the President.&#160; This arrangement would be no worse than the current approach.</p> 
<p>What is the fair way to elect Senators?&#160; There are two ways that are fair.&#160; One way is to require that a state's Senators must be from different political parties.&#160; The other way is to elect both Senators in the same election and make sure the voters who get their way in choosing the first Senator have less influence in choosing the second Senator.&#160; The second method would require amending the Constitution to allow both Senators to be elected in the same election.&#160; In Part Three you will learn the details of these two methods.</p> 
<h1>Geographic Representation Myths</h1> 
<p>There is one more district-related issue of fairness that needs to be clarified.&#160; It involves the size of Congressional districts and, if they are used, Senatorial districts.&#160; District boundaries exist only for election purposes, so their size can be increased to allow two or three (or more) Representatives to be elected together in the same race.&#160; Notice that this size issue is not involved when electing a city Mayor or state Governor because the boundaries of cities and states are permanent.</p> 
<p>Many people criticize the idea of creating larger Congressional districts because they claim the voters in the original smaller districts would fail to be as well-represented in Congress.&#160; The reality is that decisions made in Congress seldom affect limited areas within a state.&#160; Those kinds of decisions are made in state legislatures where the districts are much smaller than Congressional districts.</p> 
<p>Another criticism of larger districts involves the mistaken belief that if a district is doubled in size the elected Representative must represent twice as many people.&#160; Actually this is not the case.</p> 
<p>Consider what now happens when a single Representative is elected from a district.&#160; If the Representative is a Democrat, the Republican voters in the district are not represented.&#160; To put it another way, do you really feel represented by your Congressional Representative if he or she is from the opposite party from the one you prefer?&#160; Of course not.</p> 
<p>What would happen if two Representatives are elected from a district that is twice as large?&#160; If one of the Representatives is a Democrat and the other is a Republican, then the Democratic Representative basically represents the Democratic voters, and the Republican Representative represents the Republican voters.&#160; With this situation nearly all the voters in the double-size district are represented.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; If you are registered in a third party, consider registering as a Republican or Democrat so you can influence these parties in primary elections.&#160; Remember you can still vote for third-party candidates in general elections.</p> 
<p>Use primary elections as your opportunity to influence the agenda of the Republican or Democratic party.&#160; Pay attention to agenda differences in the primary candidates and favor the candidates who promote agendas that are similar to yours.</p> 
<p>If you regard voting for third-party candidates as a way to express frustration with the Republican and Democratic parties, channel your frustration into promoting the idea of being allowed to indicate on your ballot not only your first choice, but your second choice.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 10:&#160; Presidential Smokescreen:&#160; Solving The Electoral-College Riddle</h1> 
<p>The Electoral College consists of several parts.&#160; This chapter reveals which parts of it should be eliminated and which parts should be retained.&#160; You will also learn why improvements in Presidential elections cannot be made until voters are allowed to indicate secondary preferences.</p> 
<h1>Should We Get Rid Of The Electoral College?</h1> 
<p>Many voters believe that the biggest unfairness in U.S. elections is the use of the Electoral College.&#160; These voters believe that the Electoral College should be abolished.&#160; This belief is partly right and partly wrong.</p> 
<p>What most people don't realize is that the Electoral College is actually several concepts combined under a single name.&#160; Here are descriptions of the separate, yet related, concepts:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The Electoral College is implemented as a group of intermediate voters.&#160; Individually these people are called electors, and collectively they are called the Electoral College.&#160; Each elector has one electoral vote.</li> 
<li>The number of electoral votes assigned to each state is equal to the number of Congressmen &#8212; both in the Senate and the House of Representatives &#8212; assigned to that state.&#160; This means that the number of electoral votes is based on the population of the state plus an extra two electoral votes.</li> 
<li>Electoral votes must be assigned to Presidential candidates in whole numbers.&#160; This means the votes cannot be split up into fractional or decimal numbers.</li> 
<li>Currently nearly all 50 states assign all their electoral votes entirely to a single Presidential candidate.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Let's consider these Electoral-College issues separately in the next few sections.</p> 
<h1>Disappearing Intermediate Voters</h1> 
<p>Obviously <b>the use of intermediate voters in Presidential elections should be eliminated</b>.&#160; After all, how can a few people &#8212; whose names the voters don't even know &#8212; be representative of all the voters in their home state?&#160; This aspect of the Electoral College should be abandoned.</p> 
<p>Why hasn't it been done already?&#160; Because one of the intended purposes of the Electoral College is to resolve a Presidential election when none of the candidates gets a majority of votes.&#160; Now that computers are available to handle the collection and counting of secondary preferences from voters, there is a way to fairly resolve the lack of a first-choice majority outcome.&#160; But <b>until the Constitution is amended to request collecting and using secondary preferences, we are stuck with the Electoral College</b>.</p> 
<h1>Popping The Direct Voting Myth</h1> 
<p>Although electors are no longer necessary, electoral votes are still needed.&#160; Why?&#160; To appreciate the importance of electoral votes, let's look at a commonly recommended alternative: direct voting.</p> 
<p>Direct voting for a President refers to the idea of counting the Presidential votes in all 50 states and simply adding the numbers together to determine how many voters voted for each candidate.&#160; This approach sounds reasonable.&#160; It seems to be based on the idea that each voter deserves to have the same influence as any other voter.</p> 
<p>In reality one vote in one state is not necessarily equivalent to one vote in a different state.&#160; That's because each state has many differences that affect voting.&#160; These differences include the weather on election day, different voter-registration laws, and the integrity of election officials.&#160; Consider that the U.S. Presidential election is the only election that involves voters from more than one state, so it's the only election that is affected by state-to-state differences.</p> 
<p>To clearly see the importance of state-based differences and to better appreciate the unfairness of direct voting, let's compare direct voting with the use of electoral votes for a sample Presidential election in which the two Presidential candidates are named Clifford and Farah.</p> 
<p>In this Presidential election let's suppose there is an exact balance of votes (both direct and electoral) between the two candidates in 48 states and the outcome depends on the votes in just two states, Minnesota and Louisiana.</p> 
<p>To keep the numbers simple, let's suppose Minnesota and Louisiana have just 100 registered voters each.&#160; Also, let's suppose Minnesota and Louisiana each have 10 electoral votes (which isn't far from reality).</p> 
<p>As for voter preferences in Minnesota, let's suppose that out of the 100 voters, 40 voters prefer Clifford, and the other 60 voters prefer Farah.&#160; In Louisiana let's suppose the 100 voters have the same preferences, namely 40 voters prefer Clifford, and the other 60 voters prefer Farah.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_210_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 210" width="580" height="677"/></p> 
<p>If direct voting is used, and if all 200 voters in both Minnesota and Louisiana go to the polls and vote, Farah wins the election.&#160; That's because, between these two states, Clifford receives a total of 80 votes (40 from Minnesota and 40 from Louisiana) and Farah receives a total of 120 votes (60 from Minnesota and 60 from Louisiana).</p> 
<p>Now let's introduce some real-life complications.&#160; Let's suppose that on election day a heavy storm hits Minnesota, and only half the voters get to the polls to vote.&#160; Presumably the voters of both political parties are affected equally.&#160; This means that only 20 (out of 40) voters who prefer Clifford get to the polls to vote, and only 30 (out of 60) voters who prefer Farah get to the polls to vote.</p> 
<p>Meanwhile, in Louisiana, let's suppose there is corruption in the state's election offices, and this corruption involves blocking the votes of 32 voters who prefer Farah.&#160; In particular let's say that the names of 20 of these voters are omitted from the list of valid voters (so they aren't allowed to vote) and another 12 of these voters are given the wrong information and don't get to their correct polling place before the polls close.&#160; This means that out of the 60 voters who prefer Farah, only 28 of them vote.&#160; In contrast, let's suppose Clifford's campaign supporters arrange for voters who prefer him to sign up for absentee ballots so that all 40 voters who prefer Clifford conveniently vote through the mail.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_211_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 211" width="580" height="658"/></p> 
<p>After the effects of the storm in Minnesota and the corruption in Louisiana are taken into account there are a total of 60 votes for Clifford (20 from Minnesota and 40 from Louisiana) and 58 votes for Farah (30 from Minnesota and 28 from Louisiana).&#160; According to the rules of direct voting, Clifford wins &#8212; even though more voters actually prefer Farah.&#160; In other words, the combined effects of stormy weather in one state and corruption in another state reverses the outcome.</p> 
<h1>Wisdom Of Using Electoral Votes</h1> 
<p>Now let's see what happens if, instead of using direct voting, electoral votes are used.</p> 
<p>Currently nearly all 50 states use the all-or-nothing approach, assigning all of a state's electoral votes to a single candidate.&#160; The fairer way to handle electoral votes is to distribute them in proportion to the vote counts in each state.&#160; Using the current example, this means that if 40 out of the 100 voters prefer Clifford, 4 of the state's 10 electoral votes should go to Clifford.&#160; Proportions don't always produce whole numbers, so decimal numbers (such as 3.5, which is between three and four) must be allowed for full fairness.</p> 
<p>In the electoral-vote version of our example, let's first suppose the storm in Minnesota had not occurred.&#160; Minnesota's 10 electoral votes are distributed as 4 electoral votes for Clifford &#8212; because 40 out of 100 voters have this preference &#8212; and the other 6 electoral votes go to Farah &#8212; because 60 out of 100 voters have this preference.</p> 
<p>And let's suppose the corruption in Louisiana had not occurred.&#160; Louisiana's 10 electoral votes are distributed as 4 electoral votes for Clifford &#8212; because 40 out of 100 voters have this preference &#8212; and the other 6 electoral votes go to Farah &#8212; because 60 out of 100 voters have this preference.</p> 
<p>The result for this scenario is that Farah wins the election.&#160; That's because, between these two states, Clifford wins 8 electoral votes (4 from Minnesota and 4 from Louisiana) and Farah wins 12 electoral votes (6 from Minnesota and 6 from Louisiana).&#160; This is the same result as direct voting without any real-life complications, and it matches what the voters actually prefer.</p> 
<p>Now let's consider the real-life complications.&#160; With the storm in Minnesota, recall that 20 voters vote for Clifford and 30 voters vote for Farah.&#160; This gives Clifford four electoral votes.&#160; Why?&#160; If you use a calculator and enter 10 (electoral votes), then multiply by 20 (votes for Clifford), and then divide by 50 (total votes in Minnesota), the result is four.&#160; Notice that this number is the same as without the storm.&#160; The state's remaining six electoral votes go to Farah.&#160; (The number six also can be calculated as 10 electoral votes multiplied by 30 votes for Farah divided by 50 total votes.)</p> 
<p>The electoral-vote numbers for Louisiana change slightly as a result of the corrupt blocking of voters.&#160; Out of Louisiana's 10 electoral votes, 5.9 (between 5 and 6) electoral votes go to Clifford.&#160; This number is calculated as 10 electoral votes multiplied by 40 votes for Clifford and then divided by 68 total votes in Louisiana.&#160; The remaining 4.1 (between 4 and 5) electoral votes go to Farah.&#160; (The number 4.1 also can be calculated as 10 electoral votes multiplied by 28 votes for Farah and then divided by 68 total votes in Louisiana.)</p> 
<p>Finally we have the electoral-vote totals from Minnesota and Louisiana.&#160; Clifford receives 9.9 (between 9 and 10) electoral votes (4 from Minnesota and 5.9 from Louisiana), and Farah receives 10.1 (between 10 and 11) electoral votes (6 from Minnesota and 4.1 from Louisiana).&#160; The 10.1 electoral votes for Farah is more than the 9.9 electoral votes for Clifford, so Farah wins the Presidential election.&#160; Very importantly, recall that this matches what a majority of both Minnesota and Louisiana voters prefer.</p> 
<p>Now you see that <b>using electoral votes produces fairer results</b>.&#160; Why?&#160; Because a reduced voter turnout in one state, such as Minnesota in this example, doesn't weaken that state's influence in the final counting of votes.&#160; Explained another way, when a state's voter turnout is low, the balance between Republicans and Democrats tends to remain the same as if there were a full turnout, so the voters who do vote are basically saving other voters (in that state) from having to vote to get the same results.&#160; Expressed in terms of this example, a full voter turnout of 40 voters supporting Clifford and 60 voters supporting Farah is the same proportion as 20 voters supporting Clifford and 30 voters supporting Farah.&#160; In the reduced voter-turnout case, half as many voters show up, but Minnesota still gets its full influence as if all the state's voters voted.</p> 
<p>Using electoral votes does not completely protect the results from corruption and unfair election laws in a state, but using electoral votes limits this influence.&#160; If direct (instead of electoral) votes are used, blocking one voter in one state (such as Louisiana in this example) counts the same as blocking several voters in a state with bad weather on election day.</p> 
<p>If election corruption seems unreal, remember what actually happened in Florida at the end of the 2000 Presidential election.&#160; Within Florida there was a difference of only a few hundred votes between George W.&#160; Bush and Al Gore, and the winner of Florida's electoral votes was destined to win the Presidential election because of the close balance in other states.&#160; This situation put local, state, and Supreme-Court officials in a position of control over the choice of the next President.&#160; It was clear from the actions of those officials that, in spite of efforts to stay unbiased, some officials made decisions that favored their preferred candidate.&#160; Even the Supreme Court justices all voted according to their preferred political party.</p> 
<p>Bad weather and corruption are not the only state-to-state differences that can influence voting.&#160; Here are some others.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Each state uses different kinds of ballots.&#160; Some states use paper ballots marked by pencil, some use punch cards that are punched with a stylus, and some use electronic equipment.&#160; Such differences introduce issues of accessibility and a likelihood for making mistakes.</li> 
<li>The number of polling places and where polling places are located differ by state.&#160; For instance, the voters in rural states typically have to travel farther to get to a polling place.&#160; In Oregon there are no polling places because everyone votes by mail, and the convenience of not needing to travel to a polling place and wait in line increases voter turnout.</li> 
<li>A government official can allow the counting of mail-in ballots that are late.&#160; Mail-in ballots are more likely to be from Republican voters, so this adjustment tends to favor Republican candidates.</li> 
<li>Some states allow their residents to register to vote when they get a drivers license, and this convenience increases voter registration.&#160; Also, some states allow voters to register shortly before an election and not have to wait as long to become a new resident of the state.&#160; Republicans tend to dislike these practices because they increase the registration of people who move more often, which is more common of Democrats than Republicans.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>You now understand that <b>a vote in one state is not equivalent to a vote in another state</b>.</p> 
<p><b>Electoral votes minimize the effect of state-to-state differences, so they should continue to be used in Presidential elections</b>.&#160; Except for the issue of each state getting an extra two electoral votes, it can be said that electoral votes serve to balance the influence between states.</p> 
<h1>One Bump Or Two Per State?</h1> 
<p>Currently each state is given the same number of electoral votes as the number of Congressmen who represent the state.&#160; Specifically the number of electoral votes given to a state equals the number of members of the House of Representatives who represent the state, plus two &#8212; because each state has two Senators.</p> 
<p>The result of this approach is that each state gets two extra electoral votes beyond the number of electoral votes that are determined by the state's population.&#160; The purpose of the extra electoral votes is to prevent less-populated states, such as North Dakota and Vermont, from being ignored in Presidential elections.&#160; However, the two extra electoral votes are excessive.</p> 
<p>How excessive?&#160; Currently each electoral vote from average-size and heavily populated states &#8212; such as Georgia and New York &#8212; represents about 20,000 voters.&#160; In contrast, each electoral vote from sparsely populated states &#8212; such as North Dakota and Vermont &#8212; represents about 10,000 voters.&#160; This means that a voter in North Dakota has about twice as much influence as a voter in New York.</p> 
<p>A more reasonable approach would be to give each state just one extra electoral vote in Presidential elections.&#160; This approach still keeps less-populated states from being ignored, but without giving voters in those states excessive influence.&#160; When the Constitution is eventually amended to improve the fairness of Presidential elections, this improvement would be easy to include.</p> 
<p>After this change each electoral vote from North Dakota and Vermont would represent about 15,000 voters.&#160; This means that four voters in New York would have about the same influence as three voters in North Dakota.&#160; This extra influence of North Dakota's voters would be much more reasonable.</p> 
<h1>All Or Nothing?&#160; Of Course Not</h1> 
<p>Currently nearly every state assigns their electoral votes on a winner-take-all basis.&#160; This approach is used regardless of whether the Presidential candidate wins by a landslide or barely wins.&#160; The Constitution does not specify how electoral votes should be distributed, so why is this approach so popular?</p> 
<p>Suppose most states split up their electoral votes and assigned some to each of the two main Presidential candidates, with the split being based on the number of voters who prefer each Presidential candidate.&#160; In a close Presidential race this approach would produce a close balance of electoral votes between the two candidates.&#160; Although this kind of balance is a fairer representation of voter preferences, the balance would be upset easily if a large state chose not to cooperate, and instead chose to assign all its electoral votes to just one candidate.</p> 
<p>As an example, let's look at the 2004 Presidential election between George W.&#160; Bush and John Kerry.&#160; If each state had divided its electoral votes &#8212; giving some electoral votes to each of the two candidates according to the number of voters who prefer each candidate &#8212; Bush would have received approximately 277 electoral votes, and Kerry would have received approximately 261 electoral votes.&#160; Notice how close these numbers are.&#160; In this situation a large state with a Democratic orientation, such as California, could change the outcome simply by giving all its electoral votes to just one of the candidates.&#160; If California used the all-or-nothing approach and every other state split their electoral votes to match voter preferences, Kerry would have won instead of Bush.&#160; Naturally none of the states wants to split up its electoral votes just so that other states can be the ones to upset the results.</p> 
<p>There is another reason for the widespread use of the all-or-nothing approach.&#160; Many states have a clear majority of either Republican voters or Democratic voters, which means there is a stable, well-established majority party in the state legislature.&#160; The state legislators in the majority party naturally want to support their party's Presidential candidate, so they naturally pass a law that gives all the state's electoral votes to the Presidential candidate who receives the most votes in their state.</p> 
<p>The unfairness of the all-or-nothing approach was highlighted in the 2000 Presidential election.&#160; Months before the election there were websites for online vote swapping.&#160; The vote-swapping websites were soon declared illegal and shut down, but they revealed the strangeness of the all-or-nothing approach.&#160; How did the vote-swapping websites work?&#160; Consider a voter who preferred Al Gore and who lived in Texas where George W.&#160; Bush was clearly going to win by a large margin.&#160; This voter could agree to swap votes with another voter who preferred third-party-candidate Ralph Nader and who lived in a state such as Iowa, New Hampshire, New Mexico, or Wisconsin where the outcome was uncertain.&#160; This swap would help the Green-party voter provide Ralph Nader with a vote to help the Green party reach its goal of five percent of the vote &#8212; which would trigger federal matching funds for the Green party.&#160; Yet the swap would help the Democratic voter increase the chances of Al Gore winning in a state where the balance between Bush and Gore was close.</p> 
<p>Assigning electoral votes on a proportional basis was demonstrated in the example (earlier in this chapter) that produced decimal numbers.&#160; <b>Assigning electoral votes on a proportional basis causes every vote to make a difference in the final electoral-vote numbers</b>.&#160; The difference for each voter is only a very small fraction of an electoral vote, yet each voter can see the (tiny) effect of their vote in the final electoral-vote numbers.&#160; This visibility would increase voter turnout.</p> 
<p>For better or worse, the simple proportional approach described in this chapter cannot be done using current voting methods.&#160; Why?&#160; Because votes for third-party candidates would often lead to the lack of a majority of electoral votes for either of the two main candidates.</p> 
<p>Again let's consider the 2000 Presidential election.&#160; If the electoral votes had been split up proportionally within each state, George W.&#160; Bush would have received about 260 electoral votes, Al Gore would have received about 261 electoral votes, Ralph Nader would have received about 15 electoral votes, and the other minor candidates would have received a total of about two electoral votes.&#160; The 17 electoral votes for the minor candidates would have prevented either of the main candidates from receiving the 270 electoral votes needed to win.&#160; Such an outcome would have thrown the decision into the House of Representatives.</p> 
<p>Is there a way to split up electoral votes proportionally so that at least one of the candidates always gets a majority outcome?&#160; Not as long as single-mark ballots continue to be used.&#160; That's why we have been stuck with the all-or-nothing approach for so long.</p> 
<h1>Primary Elimination</h1> 
<p>Now let's look at a neglected issue in Presidential voting.&#160; The kind of wise politician who most voters would appreciate never even shows up on the general-election ballot.&#160; The loss of these truly popular candidates occurs in the primary elections, long before the Electoral College becomes involved.&#160; This concept is worth repeating.&#160; <b>The loss of Presidential candidates who the voters really want occurs in the primary elections, long before the general election where electoral votes are involved</b>.</p> 
<h1>Should Bush Or Gore Have Won The 2000 Presidential Election?</h1> 
<p>The historic 2000 Presidential election between George W.&#160; Bush and Al Gore brought up many concerns about the Electoral College.&#160; Now that you understand how electoral votes should be assigned, it's natural to wonder: who should have won, Bush or Gore?&#160; </p> 
<p>First and foremost, it is important to understand that if fair voting methods had been used, Bush probably would not have won the Republican primary election and Gore probably would not have won the Democratic primary election.&#160; As explained in the previous section, the kind of politicians who currently win primary elections are not the kind of politicians voters really appreciate.&#160; With this in mind, we will never know who would have won the 2000 Presidential election if fair voting methods had been used in the Republican and Democratic primary elections.</p> 
<p>As for the general election, of course we're limited to considering the votes that were actually cast.&#160; This means, for example, we cannot know how many citizens chose not to vote because they knew their vote would not make any difference in which candidate received their state's electoral votes.&#160; In contrast, fair voting methods would have caused every vote to make at least a small difference in the final numbers, and that would have motivated more voters to vote.</p> 
<p>Of course we also don't know for certain the full order-of-preference information for each voter.&#160; However, it is reasonable to make these assumptions.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Let's assume the voters who voted for Ralph Nader preferred Gore over Bush.&#160; (Later we will consider the possibility that these voters were equally split about this preference.)</li> 
<li>Let's assume the voters who voted for Browne, Harris, McReynolds, Moorehead, and Smith preferred Gore over Bush.</li> 
<li>Let's assume the voters who voted for Buchanan preferred Bush over Gore.</li> 
<li>It is difficult to know the secondary preferences of the voters who voted for Brown, Dodge, Hagelin, Lane, Phillips, Venson, and Youngkeit.&#160; Therefore let's assume they would have indicated Bush and Gore as being equally preferable.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Using the calculation methods suggested in this chapter, who would have won?&#160; A drumroll please ...!&#160; Al Gore would have won!&#160; What would the final numbers have been?&#160; Rounded to the nearest whole number, Gore would have received 250 electoral votes, and Bush would have received 236 electoral votes.&#160; In terms of percentages, the numbers are 51.4 percent in favor of Gore, 48.5 percent in favor of Bush, and 0.2 percent expressing no preference.</p> 
<p>For comparison, Gore actually received 266 electoral votes, and Bush actually received 271 electoral votes.&#160; If these numbers are converted into percentages, the numbers become 49.5 percent in favor of Gore, and 50.5 percent in favor of Bush.</p> 
<p>Also for comparison, let's consider the actual number of votes for each candidate.&#160; Gore received 50,999,897 votes, which is 48.38 percent.&#160; Bush received 50,456,002 votes, which is 47.87 percent.&#160; And Nader received 2,882,955 votes, which is 2.74 percent.&#160; As you can see, Gore received more votes than Bush.&#160; As previously explained, state-based differences make these direct-count numbers unreliable for official purposes, but they help to confirm that the fair-voting-method outcome of Gore winning the election is very reasonable.</p> 
<p>What does this comparison reveal?&#160; Most importantly it reveals that the outcome of the election was unfair because of the all-or-nothing approach currently used to assign electoral votes.&#160; This unfair all-or-nothing approach is what caused the election results to be affected by just a few hundred ballots in a few counties in Florida.&#160; If electoral votes had been split up proportionally, the real issue would have been the closeness of the race throughout the United States.</p> 
<p>This issue of closeness is extremely important, yet it was neglected by the news media.&#160; What does the closeness reveal?&#160; It reveals that a great many voters didn't like either of the two main Presidential candidates!&#160; The disapproval of these two candidates was further demonstrated by the unusual popularity of a third-party candidate, namely Ralph Nader.</p> 
<p>Hopefully you now recognize the most important issue concerning the fairness of U.S. elections.&#160; <b>The most important issue of fairness is the absence of representative politicians appearing anywhere on the ballot</b>.&#160; This absence is especially significant in general elections, after campaign contributions have excessively influenced the primary elections.</p> 
<p>Before leaving this topic of the Bush versus Gore election, let's take a closer look at one of the assumptions listed above.&#160; The assumption is that every voter who voted for Ralph Nader preferred Gore over Bush.&#160; In reality, at least some of the people who voted for Nader probably preferred Bush over Gore.</p> 
<p>Just for kicks, let's consider the exaggerated scenario in which half the voters who voted for Nader preferred Bush as their second choice, and the other half preferred Gore as their second choice.&#160; Would Gore still have won?&#160; Yes.&#160; However, the outcome would have been so close that decimal numbers need to be considered.&#160; Specifically, Gore would have received 243.35 electoral votes, and Bush would have received 242.65 electoral votes.&#160; This difference of less than a single electoral vote reveals where the attention deserves to be, namely on the money-influenced manipulation of primary elections resulting in lackluster choices in general elections.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with your clearer understanding of the Electoral College?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If someone recommends abandoning the Electoral College, ask the person how they recommend handling Presidential elections without the Electoral College.&#160; If they recommend using direct popular voting, ask how they would resolve an election where none of the candidates gets a majority.&#160; If they recommend electing the candidate with the most votes, point out the unfairness of this approach, which is called plurality voting.</li> 
<li>If someone recommends using instant-runoff voting for Presidential elections, agree that this would improve the fairness of Presidential elections.&#160; If it is appropriate, also point out that this approach would end the two-party limit, lead to complications in the voting that goes on in Congress, and lead to the need to form coalitions to get bills passed in Congress.</li> 
</ul> 

<h1>Part Three:&#160; How To Get Fair Election Results</h1> 

<h1>Chapter 11:&#160; Get Real:&#160; Letting Voters Indicate Their Second Choice, Third Choice, And So On</h1> 
<p>An essential ingredient for getting fair election results is to allow each voter to indicate not only a first choice, but also a second choice, a third choice, and so on.&#160; ranked ballots allow voters to express this full range of preference information.&#160; In this chapter let's explore ranked ballots and how marks on these ballots are interpreted.&#160; Let's also answer the question: Would digital versions of ranked ballots be better for this kind of voting?</p> 
<h1>Introducing Ranked Ballots</h1> 
<p>The best way to understand ranked ballots is to look at some examples.&#160; Let's suppose the sample ballots are for a primary election among these candidates competing for a U.S. Senate seat.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_225_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 225" width="580" height="144"/></p> 
<p>Shown below is a filled-out ranked ballot for this election.&#160; Notice that it allows a voter to indicate his or her order of preference for all the candidates.&#160; Specifically it allows the voter to indicate a first choice, second choice, third choice, and so on.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_226_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 226" width="580" height="492"/></p> 
<p>On this ballot the voter has indicated that Meredith is his first choice, Elliot is his second choice, Selden is his third choice, and Roland is his last choice.</p> 
<h1>Going Beyond Single-Mark Voting</h1> 
<p>Suppose a voter likes the old way of voting and only indicates a first choice on a ranked ballot.&#160; Here is what the ballot mark would look like.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_226_fig_2.png" alt="Figure 2 on page 226" width="580" height="492"/></p> 
<p>How would this ballot be interpreted?&#160; <b>When there is no mark for one of the choices, that choice is assumed to be less preferred than all the marked choices</b>.&#160; This means the three unmarked candidates would be ranked at the same level and would be regarded as less preferred compared to the voter's first choice.&#160; In other words Selden, Elliot, and Roland would be regarded as equally acceptable second choices.</p> 
<p>Seeing a single mark on a ranked ballot helps us appreciate why our traditional single-mark ballots are so primitive, and why marking them is so frustrating for so many voters.&#160; Essentially the single mark we are currently allowed to put on a single-mark ballot conveys that all the unmarked choices are equally acceptable second choices.</p> 
<h1>Allowing For Creativity</h1> 
<p>Suppose a voter marks a ranked ballot in this way.&#160; Should this ballot be discarded as improperly marked?</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_227_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 227" width="580" height="492"/></p> 
<p>The best way to deal with this situation is to <b>assume the left-most mark for each candidate indicates the preference level for that candidate</b>.&#160; This means the above ballot indicates that Meredith is the first choice, Elliot is the second choice, Selden is the third choice, and Roland is the fourth choice.&#160; This interpretation is reasonable.&#160; It is also much fairer than tossing out all the preference information just because some of the information might be considered unclear.</p> 
<p>When these conventions are used there is only one factor that can cause uncertainty about a voter's preferences: the failure of a voter to clearly mark an oval, or marking the ballot outside the ovals.</p> 
<h1>Skipping Columns</h1> 
<p>Inevitably some voters mark their ballot as if one of the candidates is their first choice and all the other candidates are marked as last choices.&#160; Such a ballot looks like this.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_228_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 228" width="580" height="492"/></p> 
<p>Would this strategy increase the chances of electing the preferred candidate?&#160; No, because <b>the numbers associated with the columns are ignored when the ballot is interpreted</b>.&#160; Instead this ballot would be interpreted to mean that Meredith is the voter's first choice and all the other candidates are equally acceptable.</p> 
<p>Skipping numbers is irrelevant because (as you will learn in the next chapter) the ballots are counted in a way that ignores the column numbers.&#160; <b>The only purpose of the numbers on the ballot is to help a voter keep track of which column each oval is in</b>.</p> 
<h1>Satisfaction Of Expressing Displeasure</h1> 
<p>As you may have already realized, the last-choice column isn't completely necessary.&#160; After all, if a voter's preferred candidates are marked as preferred, any unmarked candidates are obviously not preferred.</p> 
<p>Yet it is important for voters to have the opportunity to explicitly mark their least-preferred &#8212; and most disliked &#8212; choice.&#160; This approach allows voters to angrily mark their last choice, which for psychological reasons would be important for some people.</p> 
<p>In addition, <b>including a column for a least-preferred candidate reduces confusion about the interpretation of a candidate whose ovals are all unmarked</b>.&#160; Voters appreciate knowing that their least-preferred candidate will not be mistakenly assigned to anything except the lowest preference level.</p> 
<h1>Ties Of Course</h1> 
<p><b>Voters must be allowed to indicate that two or more candidates in a race are equally acceptable</b>.&#160; Ranked ballots allow a voter to express this kind of preference.&#160; Below is an example of a voter indicating an equal preference between Selden and Roland.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_229_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 229" width="580" height="492"/></p> 
<p>In this ballot the voter indicates that Meredith is the first choice and Elliot is the last choice.&#160; This means the preference level of Selden and Roland is above Elliot, but below Meredith.</p> 
<p>Why must equal preferences, or ties, be allowed on a ballot?&#160; For three reasons.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In a voter's mind, two or more candidates can genuinely be regarded as equally acceptable.&#160; Requiring the voter to somehow choose one of the candidates over another would be frustrating, unfair, and unrepresentative.</li> 
<li>Inevitably some voters mark two or more candidates at the same preference level, even when they are told not to.&#160; It is not fair to toss out the other preferences, in the same race, that are expressed on the ballot.</li> 
<li>A voter should be allowed to mark just one oval for his or her favorite choice.&#160; The only way to accept this realistic preference is to regard the remaining candidates as being equally unpreferred.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>This issue of accommodating equal preferences accounts for the difference between preference ballots and ranked ballots.&#160; (Clarification: Some people use the name <i><b>preference ballot</b></i> to also refer to what here is called the ranked ballot.&#160; Here, different names are used to emphasize that the rules for marking them are different.)&#160; <b>Preference ballots, which are used in instant-runoff voting and the single transferable vote, do not allow ties on a ballot</b> because those voting methods have no way to deal with equal preferences &#8212; except to discard the ballot (when the tied preference level is reached).</p> 
<p>Ranked ballots are used with VoteFair ranking, which is described in the next chapter.&#160; For reasons you will soon understand, <b>VoteFair ranking easily accommodates equal preferences</b>.&#160; This flexibility is essential for truly fair results.&#160; After all, the point of voting is to allow voters to express their actual preferences.</p> 
<h1>No Written Numbers Or Punched Cards</h1> 
<p>Some election organizers, especially in small elections, make the mistake of using a ballot on which a voter must write numbers to indicate preference levels.&#160; As explained in Chapter 7, this approach introduces confusion and uncertainty about voter preferences.&#160; Therefore, <b>writing numbers on a ballot must not be used as a substitute for the paper ballots shown here</b>.</p> 
<p>The use of punch cards is also inappropriate.&#160; With this type of ballot the voter uses a stylus to poke holes at specific locations in the punch card.&#160; The big disadvantage of punch-card ballots is that a voter cannot see which holes they have already punched.&#160; As finally discovered in Florida during the 2000 Presidential election, this type of ballot is not even a good choice for single-mark ballots.</p> 
<p><b>When paper ballots are used, they should be of the type that only involves using a pencil or pen to fill in circles or ovals</b>.&#160; Handwritten numbers and punch cards result in too many ballots being discarded, or marked in ways that fail to represent a voter's preferences.</p> 
<h1>Long Live Paper Ballots!</h1> 
<p>For an election to be fair, <b>some ballots must be capable of being printed on paper and marked by pencil or pen</b>.&#160; That is, a voter must not be <i>required</i> to use a computer to vote.&#160; Why?&#160; Because it allows a bedridden voter who doesn't own a computer to vote.&#160; More importantly, in the not-too-distant future, voting by mail will become increasingly common.</p> 
<p>Voting by mail is already used in Oregon for every election.&#160; It significantly increases voter turnout because <b>mail-in voting is much more convenient</b>.&#160; Voting is done at home.&#160; And the ballot can be marked and mailed at any time during the two or three weeks prior to Election Day.</p> 
<p>Compare the convenience of voting by mail with the use of polling places.&#160; The need for a voter to travel to a particular location on a particular day is very inconvenient, and significantly reduces voter turnout.&#160; Some voters are even limited to voting during early morning hours or evening hours because their designated polling place is near their home and far from where they work.</p> 
<p>Many people are concerned about the possibilities for fraudulent voting if voting is done by mail.&#160; Eventually most such objections will be overcome by the use of fingerprints.&#160; Fingerprinting technology will soon evolve to the point of making it easy for a voter to mark the outside of a security envelope with a fingerprint (with allowances for alternate attempts) and the fingerprints on randomly selected ballots will be checked for authenticity.&#160; In the meantime, a signature on a mailed-in ballot provides almost as much protection against fraudulent voting as the current tradition of using signatures at polling places.</p> 
<p>Initially many citizens will be concerned about privacy regarding the use of fingerprints on mailed-in ballots.&#160; Yet to the degree that government makes increasingly ethical decisions about what is legal and illegal, fewer and fewer citizens will have anything to hide.</p> 
<p>Many objections to voting-by-mail can be raised.&#160; Yet each objection is easily overcome.&#160; For example, the possible inconvenience and cost of buying a stamp is avoided in Oregon by offering conveniently located ballot boxes for use by people who prefer not to send their ballot through the mail.&#160; As another example, some politicians are likely to oppose voting by mail because the resulting increase in voter turnout will predominantly be from voters who oppose these politicians.&#160; Yet increased voter participation should be a goal, not an election-manipulation consideration.</p> 
<h1>Digital Ballots</h1> 
<p>As a result of the ballot-design problems and the hanging chads in the 2000 Presidential election, computers are increasingly used at polling places to assist voters with the voting process.&#160; This increased use of computers will also make it easier for voters to fill out ranked ballots.</p> 
<p>The big advantage of digital voting is that a voter can point to candidate names in the sequence in which they are preferred.&#160; This means a voter can first point to his or her first choice, then point to his or her second choice, and so on.&#160; Of course there would also be ways to make adjustments and specify some choices as being at an equal level of preference.&#160; In some cases the ballots will look like paper ballots, and in that case the ovals can be marked by clicking on them.&#160; To experience digital voting you can try the interactive ballots at VoteFair.org.</p> 
<p>Digital voting offers another big convenience.&#160; The order in which candidates are listed can match the political-party preferences of the voter.&#160; For example, if a voter indicates that he or she most prefers the Republican party, second-most prefers the Democratic party, and most dislikes the Green party, each race would list the candidates starting with Republican candidates and ending with Green-party candidates.&#160; This arrangement is less disorienting than the paper-based convention of putting the candidate names in semi-random order.</p> 
<p>Additional advantages of digital voting include the elimination of ballots that are filled out incorrectly and reduced costs for counting ballots.</p> 
<h1>Security Solutions</h1> 
<p>Unfortunately digital voting introduces many security weaknesses that allow election results to be corrupted.&#160; Even worse, many of these corruption methods are difficult to trace.</p> 
<p>How can these security weaknesses be avoided?&#160; In the early stages of using digital voting for governmental elections <b>the equipment at a polling place must print a correctly marked ballot</b>, the voter would be invited to examine the marked ballot, and then the voter would place the ballot in the ballot box.&#160; This approach eliminates the many possible sources of corruption that can arise from digital voting.</p> 
<p>Even after the security weaknesses of digital voting at polling places have been resolved, digital voting will not completely replace paper ballots.&#160; Instead, <b>both digital voting and paper voting will be used in the same election</b>.&#160; Eventually each voter will be allowed to choose between voting by mail, voting by telephone, or possibly voting in person at a polling location.&#160; Each method offers different advantages, and the different advantages suit different voters.</p> 
<p>Some people think that web-based voting through the Internet would be even more convenient.&#160; But Internet communications are not secure enough to handle government elections.&#160; In contrast, <b>web-based voting is very useful for electing the officers of a small organization, conducting surveys, ranking musical preferences, and other informal forms of voting</b>.&#160; In these situations the results are not important enough to motivate people to spend time and money attempting to corrupt the results.</p> 
<h1>Dialing For Votes</h1> 
<p><b>Digital voting also can be done using a telephone</b>.&#160; How would this work?</p> 
<p>Suppose a television talent show asks viewers to call a special telephone number and rank the contestants who have just performed.&#160; After dialing the phone number, a viewer would enter the contestant numbers in the sequence the viewer prefers the contestants.&#160; For instance, a viewer who prefers contestant number 2 as the first choice and contestant number 1 as the second choice, would first press the number 2 key and then press the number 1 key.&#160; If this voting had been done using a paper ballot, this is how the equivalent ballot for a three-choice contest would have been marked.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_234_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 234" width="580" height="384"/></p> 
<p>To avoid invalid votes, rules such as these can be used for telephone voting.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If a voter enters the same number more than once, the repetitions are ignored, and only the first occurrence is counted.</li> 
<li>Any numbers that are not entered by a voter are regarded as equally disliked.</li> 
<li>As is common, pressing the star (&#42;) key would activate a spoken menu of options.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>When voting by telephone involves a toll-free number, fraudulent voting can be reduced because the phone number of each person who calls is provided to the business that pays for the calls.</p> 
<h1>Why?&#160; Why Not?</h1> 
<p>If ranked ballots are so wonderful, why aren't they already in common use?&#160; Because, until recently, there has been no fair way of using the order-of-preference information to produce fair results.&#160; As you learned in Part Two, there have been a variety of methods for counting ranked ballots, but those methods do not produce fair results.&#160; In the next chapter you will learn about a relatively new method called VoteFair ranking.&#160; It transforms marked ranked ballots into fair results.</p> 
<p>The unfair days of using single-mark ballots will soon become a part of history.&#160; How wonderful!&#160; We will finally be able to mark ballots in a way that indicates our actual preferences.&#160; No longer will strategic voting be necessary, or even effective.</p> 
<p>But remember, <b>just using ranked ballots does not produce fair results</b>!&#160; In the next chapter you will learn what needs to be done to transform order-of-preference information into fair results.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; The next time you are in a small group of people who are voting for more than two choices, recommend that ranked ballots be used.&#160; Use the opportunity to educate yourself and the other voters about this fairer method of collecting voter preferences.&#160; Before making this recommendation consider that you also must use VoteFair ranking (described in the next chapter) to determine the results.&#160; Even if your recommendation is not adopted, your recommendation will probably inspire at least one other person to learn about better ways of voting.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 12:&#160; Finally Fair:&#160; VoteFair Ranking Reveals True Popularity</h1> 
<p>VoteFair popularity ranking is the key ingredient needed for fairer election results.&#160; In contrast to the unfairness of U.S. voting methods &#8212; namely plurality voting and runoff voting &#8212; VoteFair popularity ranking correctly identifies the most popular candidate in an election.&#160; It also identifies the second-most popular candidate, the third-most popular candidate, and so on, which no other voting method even attempts to do.&#160; In this chapter let's look at how VoteFair popularity ranking works, and why it produces such fair results.</p> 
<h1>Introducing VoteFair Popularity Ranking</h1> 
<p>This chapter describes VoteFair popularity ranking, which is the general-purpose form of VoteFair ranking.&#160; There are two variations of VoteFair ranking, namely VoteFair representation ranking (described in Chapter 15) and VoteFair party ranking (described in Chapter 16).&#160; The variations are only used in special situations.&#160; <b>All three forms of VoteFair ranking begin with the steps of VoteFair popularity ranking, so all three forms identify the same first-place winner.&#160; The variations only involve differences in terms of identifying the second-place winner, third-place winner, and so on</b>.&#160; The term <b>VoteFair ranking</b> refers to whichever form is needed for a situation, and in most cases this is VoteFair popularity ranking.</p> 
<p>What does VoteFair popularity ranking do?&#160; It reveals the popularity of each choice in an election.</p> 
<p>To arrive at completely fair results, <b>VoteFair ranking takes into account <i>all</i> the voter preferences expressed in every ranked ballot</b>.&#160; As you learned in the previous chapter, a ranked ballot allows a voter to indicate a first choice, second choice, third choice, and so on.</p> 
<p>What advantages does VoteFair ranking offer?</p> 
<ul> 
<li><b>Strategic voting does not work</b>.&#160; This means if a voter expresses his or her actual preferences on the ballot, the voter's influence on the election results are not reduced, regardless of how other voters vote.&#160; In particular, voters do not need to use a strategy such as voting for the least-offensive candidate among the ones who have a chance of winning.&#160; If a voter attempts to vote strategically, no added influence can be gained.</li> 
<li><b>The splitting of votes is not a problem</b>. As a result, campaign contributors cannot manipulate election results by exploiting the vote-splitting vulnerability of plurality voting.&#160; Expressed in a different way, the removal or addition of a non-winning candidate does not change who wins an election.</li> 
<li><b>A voter can indicate an equal preference among any candidates in a race</b>.&#160; This allows VoteFair ranking to use ranked ballots (which allow equal preferences) instead of preference ballots (which do not allow equal preferences).</li> 
</ul> 
<p>(Clarification: Some election-method experts may claim that strategic voting does work with VoteFair ranking.&#160; From an exact mathematical perspective that claim is correct.&#160; However, strategic voting only works in situations that do not have a <i>Condorcet winner</i> and that involve <i>circular ambiguity</i>.&#160; As the word <i>ambiguity</i> implies, circular ambiguity involves a convoluted voting pattern in which it is difficult for any method to clearly identify which candidate deserves to win.&#160; In such situations it may be possible for a group of voters &#8212; who know in advance how most other voters will vote &#8212; to mark their ballots in a way that affects the results with more influence than normal.&#160; Yet circular ambiguity seldom occurs when there are more than about 20 independently thinking voters.&#160; In other words, these strategic-vulnerability conditions rarely occur in governmental elections, so VoteFair ranking is much less vulnerable to strategic voting than virtually all other voting methods.)</p> 
<h1>Step One, Tally, Step Two, Score</h1> 
<p>VoteFair popularity ranking is a two-step process.&#160; The first step involves looking at ranked ballots one at a time and doing a special kind of counting.&#160; The result of this counting is to produce something called a tally table.&#160; This tally table summarizes all the preference information on all the ballots.&#160; Soon you will see an example, so don't worry if this brief description doesn't make sense.&#160; Simply keep in mind that the first step involves counting the ballots in a special way.</p> 
<p>The second step of VoteFair popularity ranking consists of analyzing the information in the tally table.&#160; This analysis involves testing every possibility in terms of which candidate might be most popular, which candidate might be second-most popular, and so on.&#160; Each of these possibilities is given a score based on the numbers in the tally table.&#160; The possibility that has the highest score is the one that ranks all the candidates according to their actual popularity.&#160; This brief explanation is probably confusing, but don't worry.&#160; Soon you will see an example that demonstrates this second step.&#160; For now just recognize that the second step involves analyzing the numbers produced by the first step.</p> 
<h1>Counting In A New Way</h1> 
<p>Let's follow an example to see how VoteFair ranking counts the preference information in ranked ballots.&#160; In this example let's use the same four candidates as in the previous chapter.&#160; These candidates are Selden, Meredith, Elliot, and Roland.</p> 
<p>Let's start by looking at a ballot in which Selden is the first choice, Meredith is the second choice, Elliot is the third choice, and Roland is the fourth choice.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_240_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 240" width="580" height="492"/></p> 
<p>What we want to count is the number of voters who prefer one candidate over another candidate.&#160; We need to keep track of these preferences for every possible combination of two candidates.&#160; For this ballot, here are the counts that summarize this voter's preferences:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 voter prefers Selden over Meredith</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Selden over Elliot</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Selden over Roland</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Meredith over Elliot</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Meredith over Roland</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Elliot over Roland</li> 
</ul> 
<p><b>As you look at the description for each of these counts, also look at the ballot to verify that this information matches the preferences indicated on the ballot</b>.&#160; Doing this comparison is important.&#160; It clarifies that this counting process simply converts the voter's preferences, as expressed on the ballot, into a different, yet equivalent, form.</p> 
<p>We are counting multiple pieces of information, and this kind of counting is often called tallying.&#160; In fact, counting votes in a traditional election is often referred to as tallying votes.&#160; So let's call each of these counts a tally.&#160; This shift in terminology will make it easier to understand the information contained in the tally table that we are beginning to create.</p> 
<h1>Tidy Tallying</h1> 
<p>More tallying is done as each ballot is considered.&#160; Simply listing the tally numbers would become awkward, so let's rearrange the numbers into a table arrangement.&#160; The rearranged tally numbers that apply to the first ballot now look like this.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_241_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 241" width="580" height="428"/></p> 
<p>As you can see, each row (which goes from left to right) of the tally table refers to a particular pair of candidates.&#160; In each such pair, one of the candidates is identified as the <b>X</b> candidate and the other candidate is identified as the <b>Y</b> candidate.</p> 
<p>The tally table contains three columns (which go from top to bottom) that contain numbers.&#160; (At this point the numbers are just the numbers 1 and 0.)&#160; These three columns are labeled <b>X preferred over Y</b>, <b>X and Y equally preferred</b>, and <b>Y preferred over X</b>.</p> 
<p>Look at any pair of candidate names.&#160; To the right of these two candidate names are three numbers.&#160; <b>The left-most number indicates how many voters prefer the X candidate over the Y candidate.&#160; The middle number indicates how many voters have no preference between the X and Y candidates.&#160; And the right-most number indicates how many voters prefer the Y candidate over the X candidate</b>.</p> 
<p>This table-based arrangement makes the information easier to comprehend and more compact compared to simply listing the information.&#160; Later you will learn about another advantage of this arrangement.</p> 
<p>There is nothing special about the sequence in which the names appear in the left column.&#160; More importantly, <b>the sequence in which the candidate names appear does not affect the final results</b>.&#160; All that matters is that every possible pair of candidate names appears in one of the rows.&#160; Whether a candidate name appears as an <b>X</b> candidate name or a <b>Y</b> candidate name doesn't matter.</p> 
<h1>Fruitless Confusions</h1> 
<p>Now let's look at a second ballot.&#160; In this case let's suppose a voter marks his or her ballot in an unusual way.&#160; Specifically, let's suppose Roland is marked as the voter's first preference, Meredith and Elliot are both marked as fourth preferences, and nothing is marked for Selden.&#160; In other words, the ballot contains a gap in the preference levels, and the voter has indicated a tie for two of the candidates.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_243_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 243" width="580" height="492"/></p> 
<p>Here are the tallies that summarize the preference information in this ballot:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>1 voter prefers Roland over Selden</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Roland over Meredith</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Roland over Elliot</li> 
<li>1 voter has no preference between Meredith and Elliot</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Meredith over Selden</li> 
<li>1 voter prefers Elliot over Selden</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Take the time to verify that this tally information summarizes the preferences indicated on the ballot.</p> 
<p>Notice that <b>the preference gap on the ballot</b> &#8212; between the first-level preference (Roland) and the fourth-level preference (which is a tie between Meredith and Elliot) &#8212; <b>does not show up in the tally information</b>.&#160; In other words, the tally information would be the same as if the voter had marked the ballot as shown below.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_244_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 244" width="580" height="492"/></p> 
<p>If preference gaps did weaken candidates that are ranked at less-preferred preference levels, many voters would use this strategic-voting technique to manipulate the results.&#160; Fortunately the tallying process makes preference gaps irrelevant.&#160; As a result, this attempted voting strategy doesn't work.</p> 
<p><b>It is to the voter's advantage to simply express a full order of preference for all the candidates</b>. In other words, sincere voting, rather than strategic voting, works best.</p> 
<p><b>Although VoteFair ranking allows ties on a ballot, ties should only be used if a voter really can't make up his or her mind about which of the tied candidates he or she actually prefers</b>.&#160; Expressing an equal preference between two or more candidates amounts to saying, &#8220;I'll let the other voters determine which of these candidates is a better choice.&#8221;</p> 
<p>Let's look at the numbers in the tally table after the tally information from the second ballot has been added.&#160; The numbers that have changed (from 0 to 1) are marked with an asterisk (&#42;).</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_245_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 245" width="580" height="428"/></p> 
<p>Now you understand how the tallying is done.&#160; For each ballot, the appropriate tally numbers are increased by one count.</p> 
<h1>More Ballots, More Preferences</h1> 
<p>Let's suppose that in the election we are considering there are 100 voters.&#160; As in previous chapters, let's use numbers that are multiples of 10, which means that within a group of 10 voters each voter has the same preferences as the other voters in the same group.&#160; All the preferences of all 100 voters are shown in the illustration below.</p> 
<p>This illustration uses the same convention as in earlier chapters (especially 5 and 6) except that the voters are not shown (because of a lack of space).&#160; The preferences of each group of ten voters is represented by the candidate names and shadings in each row.&#160; For instance, the ten voters represented by the row at the top prefer Selden as their first choice, they prefer Elliot as their second choice, and their least favorite choice is a tie between Meredith and Roland.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_246_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 246" width="577" height="750"/></p> 
<h1>Filled Tally Table</h1> 
<p>Based on these voter preferences, we can finish tallying the ballots.&#160; The final tally numbers are shown in the next table.&#160; At this point just glance at the table because in a moment we will look at a few specific numbers in it.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_247_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 247" width="580" height="428"/></p> 
<p>Let's look at a few numbers in this tally table to confirm that the numbers match the voter preferences shown in the previous illustration.</p> 
<p>The top row of the table compares the popularity of Selden and Meredith.&#160; The number 70 indicates that 70 voters prefer Selden over Meredith.&#160; Also in this row the number 30 indicates that the remaining 30 voters prefer Meredith over Selden.&#160; The number zero indicates that none of the voters expressed an equal preference between these two candidates.</p> 
<p>To confirm the accuracy of these numbers, look at the illustration above and notice, for each group of 10 voters, whether the candidate name Selden appears to the left or the right of the candidate name Meredith.&#160; As you can see, there are seven groups of voters for which the name Selden appears to the left of the name Meredith, and there are three groups of voters for which these names have the opposite orientation (which means the name Selden is to the right of the name Meredith).&#160; This check confirms that the numbers in the first row of the tally table match the voter preferences.</p> 
<p>Now look at the numbers in the middle column labeled <i><b>X and Y equally preferred</b></i>.&#160; Most of these numbers are zero, but one of them is 10, and another is 20.&#160; The number 10 represents the number of voters who have an equal preference between Meredith and Elliot.&#160; This number matches the fact that in the illustration only one group of 10 voters has an equal preference between these two candidates.&#160; Similarly you can confirm that the number 20 matches the fact that two groups of voters have an equal preference between Meredith and Roland.</p> 
<p>As you can see, <b>the numbers in a tally table provide a summary of the preferences expressed on all the ballots</b>.</p> 
<h1>Scoring Every Possible Ranking Sequence</h1> 
<p>Now let's see how VoteFair ranking uses the information in the tally table to answer the question, &#8220;What is the overall ranking of candidates?&#8221; Specifically we want to know which candidate is the most popular, which is the second-most popular, which is the third-most popular, and so on.</p> 
<p>VoteFair calculations essentially &#8220;try out&#8221; each possible sequence of preferences.&#160; In other words, using the names of the candidates above, we ask these questions.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>How popular is the sequence of Selden winning first place, Meredith winning second place, Elliot winning third place, and Roland winning fourth place?</li> 
<li>How popular is the sequence of Meredith winning first place, Selden winning second place, Elliot winning third-place, and Roland winning fourth place?</li> 
<li>How popular is the sequence of Elliot winning first place, Selden winning second place, Meredith winning third place, and Roland winning fourth place?</li> 
<li>And so on, until ...</li> 
<li>Finally, how popular is the sequence of Roland winning first place, Elliot winning second place, Meredith winning third place, and Selden winning fourth place.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Notice that the last sequence is a complete reversal of the first sequence.</p> 
<p>Do you see the pattern?&#160; <b>Each candidate is considered for every position, with the other candidates in every possible remaining position</b>.</p> 
<p>In this sample election with four candidates, there are 24 possible sequences to consider.&#160; In a race involving five candidates, there are 120 possible sequences.&#160; For a six-candidate race there are 720 possible sequences.&#160; As you can see, the number of sequences increases rapidly with each added candidate.</p> 
<p>The process of determining the popularity of each possible sequence involves the addition of numbers and keeping track of which numbers to add.&#160; You will soon see how these simple calculations are done.&#160; But don't panic!&#160; If you don't like dealing with numbers, just skip ahead to the next section, which is titled <i>What Took So Long?</i>.&#160; You already understand the important point, which is that every possible order of preference is considered as part of identifying the overall popularity of the candidates.</p> 
<p>For those of you who haven't panicked and skipped ahead, here is good news.&#160; You will never have to actually do the calculations described in this section!&#160; Through the magic of software a computer handles these calculations for you.&#160; Better yet, you don't even have to obtain any kind of software because at least one website, VoteFair.org, calculates the results for free.&#160; Of course if you take the time to understand how the calculations are done, you will better appreciate why the results are so fair.</p> 
<p>How is the popularity of each order-of-preference sequence evaluated?&#160; We simply add up the tally numbers that apply to that particular sequence.&#160; For example, consider the last sequence of Roland winning first place, Elliot winning second place, Meredith winning third place, and Selden winning fourth place.&#160; These tallies, which in this case are all in the right-most column, apply.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>30 voters prefer Meredith over Selden</li> 
<li>60 voters prefer Elliot over Selden</li> 
<li>30 voters prefer Roland over Selden</li> 
<li>70 voters prefer Elliot over Meredith</li> 
<li>20 voters prefer Roland over Meredith</li> 
<li>30 voters prefer Roland over Elliot</li> 
</ul> 
<p>The resulting sum of these numbers is 240.&#160; This number is the sequence score for the (already-described) last possible sequence.&#160; Expressed in general terms, <b>the score for each sequence equals the sum of the numbers in the tally table that apply to that sequence</b>.&#160; Of course it would be tedious to manually calculate the sequence scores for the 24 sequences in this example, so let's look at the scores shown below that were calculated (in just a fraction of a second) on a computer.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_251_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 251" width="472" height="750"/></p> 
<p><b>The largest score</b> in this table is 400.&#160; It <b>identifies which sequence best represents the overall order of preference for the candidates</b>.&#160; Specifically, it identifies this sequence as the winning sequence:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Elliot wins first place</li> 
<li>Selden wins second place</li> 
<li>Meredith wins third place</li> 
<li>Roland wins fourth place</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Where did the score of 400 come from?&#160; It was calculated by adding the six numbers that are marked with asterisks in the following copy of the tally table.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_252_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 252" width="580" height="428"/></p> 
<p>As you can verify, the numbers marked with asterisks add up to 400.&#160; This is the largest score of all the possible sequences, so this sequence reveals the overall order of preference.</p> 
<p>In this example the numbers marked with asterisks happen to be the largest numbers in each row.&#160; This fact makes it obvious that no other sequence could have tally numbers that add up to a larger sequence score.&#160; It is not always this easy to determine the results just by looking at the tally-table numbers, but this is a good way to verify that the results are correct.</p> 
<h1>What Took So Long?</h1> 
<p>If calculating 24 sequence scores seems like a lot of work, consider what happens when an election involves more candidates.&#160; When an election involves seven candidates, there are 5,040 possible sequences, and the score for each sequence involves adding 21 numbers.&#160; That adds up to more than 100,000 additions.</p> 
<p>Interestingly <b>the number of additions only depends on the number of candidates, not the number of ballots</b>.</p> 
<p>A century ago the calculations for just three races with five candidates each, might have required days of work by a large team of clerical workers.&#160; Now that personal computers are readily available and very fast, the calculations are done in less than a second.&#160; This historical perspective reveals why VoteFair ranking was not practical until recently.&#160; Very significantly <b>the calculations would have been unthinkable at the time the U.S. Constitution was written</b>.</p> 
<p>Even now it's easy to believe that these calculations become unthinkable if an election involves 50 candidates.&#160; Fortunately the task of finding the sequence with the highest score does not require the brute-force method of checking every sequence and calculating every score.&#160; In fact, well-designed software can find the highest-score sequence without calculating even one sequence score.&#160; (In most cases the difference between two sequence scores can be calculated by subtracting the appropriate two numbers in the tally table.)&#160; Yes, the task of writing efficient software is challenging, but efficient open-source (free and transparent) software is already available.&#160; It can calculate results for 50 candidates within minutes.</p> 
<h1>Two-Choice Simplicity</h1> 
<p>Does a complication arise when an election involves only two candidates?&#160; Quite the contrary.&#160; In two-choice elections the tally table contains only one row of three numbers.&#160; The three numbers simply indicate how many voters prefer one candidate, how many voters prefer the other candidate, and how many voters have no preference between the two candidates.&#160; Here is an example for a contest between Selden and Meredith.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_253_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 253" width="580" height="142"/></p> 
<p>In VoteFair ranking, what is done with the count of voters who express no preference between the two candidates?&#160; The same thing that's done in plurality voting: the number is ignored.&#160; This is fair because when a voter indicates an equal preference, the voter is essentially saying, &#8220;I'll let the other voters decide which of these candidates is better.&#8221; Although no-preference votes might seem unlikely in real elections, they are common in races for obscure offices, such as Water Board Council Member, where few people know who the candidates are.</p> 
<p>In a two-choice contest, the second step of VoteFair ranking involves just two sequences.&#160; For example, in the contest between Selden and Meredith, one sequence would be Selden as the first choice, and Meredith as the second choice, and the score for this sequence would be the number of voters who prefer Selden over Meredith.&#160; The other sequence would be Meredith as the first choice, and Selden as the second choice, and the score for this sequence would be the number of voters who prefer Meredith over Selden.&#160; Obviously the sequence with the higher score would have the candidate with more votes in first place.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_254_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 254" width="580" height="221"/></p> 
<p>As you can see, <b>when there are only two choices, VoteFair ranking produces the same results as using plurality voting</b>.&#160; This equivalence is important because plurality voting produces fair results in two-choice contests.</p> 
<h1>Ties Without A Knot</h1> 
<p>Just as in plurality voting, <b>when a tie occurs in VoteFair results, the tie indicates that the number of voters who have one preference exactly equals the number of voters who have the opposite preference</b>.</p> 
<p>Because VoteFair ranking goes beyond just identifying the most popular choice, there is a possibility of a tie occurring at a popularity level other than first place.&#160; As a result, <b>a tie can occur for first place, a tie can occur for second place, a tie can occur for third place, and so on</b>.</p> 
<p>Here is an example of VoteFair results in which there is a two-way tie at second place.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_255_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 255" width="580" height="219"/></p> 
<p>What indicates the existence of a tie?&#160; In the step-two calculations, <b>a tie is involved if two or more of the sequence scores are exactly the same</b>.&#160; When this happens, the same computer software that calculates the popularity numbers also identifies which candidates are tied, and at what popularity levels the ties occur.</p> 
<p>Usually, but not always, the existence of a tie also shows up in the tally table.&#160; In particular, a tie is likely if one of the numbers in the <i>X preferred over Y</i> column exactly equals the number in the <i>Y preferred over X</i> column in the same row.&#160; For example, the above tie between Selden and Meredith suggests that the number of voters who prefer Selden over Meredith exactly equals the number of voters who prefer Meredith over Selden.&#160; The number of voters who have an equal preference between Selden and Meredith is irrelevant.&#160; (Under extremely rare circumstances a tie can occur even though there is no evidence of the balanced numbers in the tally table.)</p> 
<p>Ties are just as uncommon in VoteFair ranking as in plurality voting.&#160; When an election involves a large number of voters, an exact balance of opposing preferences is extremely rare.&#160; In contrast, a tie can easily occur if the voting is done among a small group of people, such as club members or city-council members.</p> 
<p>When VoteFair ranking is used to elect a single official, a tie in second place or third place is of no significance.&#160; But if a first-place tie occurs, or if a significant lower-level tie occurs, the tie can be resolved using traditional tie-breaking methods.&#160; These methods include turning the decision over to a judicial court, introducing a tie-breaking vote, recounting the ballots in hopes of getting a different result, or flipping a coin.</p> 
<h1>Tactical Impotence</h1> 
<p><b>When VoteFair ranking is used, the outcome cannot be manipulated by splitting votes among similar candidates</b>.&#160; This means the tactic of supplying campaign contributions to a spoiler candidate for the purpose of splitting the votes does not work.&#160; Why?&#160; Because voters who indicate the spoiler candidate as their first choice also get to indicate the similar candidate as their second choice.&#160; Assuming these two similar candidates are more popular than the money-backed candidate, VoteFair ranking would reveal as the winner whichever of the similar candidates is preferred by more voters.</p> 
<p>Another interesting aspect of VoteFair ranking concerns the voters whose first choice is the candidate who would benefit from vote splitting.&#160; These voters also get to indicate their preference for the two similar candidates.&#160; As a result, all the voters &#8212; not just the ones who prefer the two similar candidates &#8212; get to influence the results.</p> 
<p>The reverse of vote splitting, namely withdrawing a candidate so the most similar candidate can more easily win, also becomes pointless when VoteFair ranking is used.&#160; Why?&#160; Because the numbers in the tally table do not change.&#160; What changes is that the rows involving the withdrawn candidate are removed from the table.</p> 
<p>In general, <b>when VoteFair ranking is used</b> with more than just a few voters, <b>adding or withdrawing non-winning candidates cannot increase or decrease the chances of a particular candidate winning</b>.&#160; This fairness eliminates one of the most effective manipulation tactics used by large campaign contributors.</p> 
<p>As a further fairness, strategic voting has no effect when VoteFair ranking is used.&#160; <b>Any attempt by a voter to increase the likelihood of winning for a particular candidate fails to have any effect beyond what is achieved by simply marking the ballot according to the voter's actual preferences</b>.&#160; To appreciate why, consider that strategic voting works in instant-runoff voting only because that method starts with the top preferences and only considers some secondary preferences of some voters.&#160; In contrast, <b>VoteFair ranking considers all the preferences of all the voters</b>.</p> 
<p>As a related point, any strategy that involves marking two or more candidates at the same level of preference fails to provide any strategic benefit.&#160; Instead, this strategy blocks the voter from affecting the overall popularity of the candidates who are marked as equally preferred.</p> 
<p>For these reasons <b>it is in each voter's best interests to use sincere voting</b>.&#160; Also, <b>for full influence, a voter should avoid using the same level of preference for two or more candidates</b> &#8212; unless the voter really has absolutely no preferences among these candidates.</p> 
<p>Now you can better appreciate that <b>VoteFair ranking provides fair results regardless of voting-based attempts to manipulate the results</b>.&#160; Of course <b>election results can still be influenced through marketing tactics, but such tactics can be ignored by voters</b>.&#160; In contrast, the current use of plurality voting and runoff voting makes elections vulnerable to voting-based tactics that cannot be avoided by voters.</p> 
<h1>Checking The Results</h1> 
<p>How can voters be assured that VoteFair ranking produces truly fair results?&#160; This is easy to do.&#160; <b>Any voter can look at the appropriate numbers in the tally table to verify the fairness of the final election results</b>.</p> 
<p>As an example, suppose someone questions the validity of the results calculated in the sample election presented earlier in this chapter.&#160; Specifically, suppose someone believes that Selden, not Elliot, should have been declared the most popular candidate.&#160; The disbeliever can look at the numbers in the tally table and see that 40 voters prefer Selden over Elliot, whereas 60 voters prefer Elliot over Selden.&#160; This simple comparison reveals the belief to be mistaken.</p> 
<p>For this reason, <b>when VoteFair election results are announced, the numbers in the tally table also must be made available</b> (although not necessarily in the same location).&#160; This information allows any voter to confirm the fairness of the results.&#160; The fact that the tally table is created simply by counting the preferences expressed in ballots means that voters do not have to blindly trust the calculations done in step two of VoteFair ranking.&#160; Instead voters can rely on the accuracy of counting votes, just as is done now.</p> 
<h1>Majority Rule At Last</h1> 
<p>Some critics are likely to claim that the one-on-one comparisons revealed in the tally table sometimes lack credibility because they don't always indicate that a majority of voters prefer the winning candidate.</p> 
<p>As an example of this criticism, consider our sample election.&#160; Instead of the previous voter preferences, suppose 15 voters who prefer Elliot over Selden change their vote to indicate an equal preference between these two candidates.&#160; The numbers in the tally table would then indicate that 45 voters prefer Elliot over Selden, 15 voters now express an equal preference for these two candidates, and the remaining 40 voters continue to prefer Selden over Elliot.&#160; Let's assume that the other numbers in the tally table do not change.</p> 
<p>These changed numbers indicate that more voters &#8212; 45 compared to 40 &#8212; still prefer the winning candidate, Elliot.&#160; However, a critic would point out that the 45 voters who prefer the winning candidate is fewer than half the 100 total votes.&#160; This interpretation suggests that the winning candidate did not receive a majority of votes.</p> 
<p>This criticism overlooks what happens in plurality voting.&#160; In plurality voting the 15 votes that express an equal preference are ignored, and not counted.&#160; This means plurality voting counts 45 votes in favor of Elliot, and 40 votes in favor of Selden, and counts a total of only 85 votes.&#160; This is a clear majority because 45 votes out of 85 votes equals 53 percent, and this is more than half.&#160; In other words, <b>in a two-choice contest, plurality voting always produces a majority result</b> (except when there is a tie) <b>because plurality voting ignores ballots that fail to express a preference</b>.</p> 
<p>Unlike the counting approach used with plurality voting, a tally table includes a count for the number of voters who express an equal preference between two choices.&#160; Yet <b>when identifying whether a majority result is achieved, the equal-preference count should be ignored, just as it is for plurality voting</b>.&#160; Now you can see that when we use the same definition of <b>majority</b> that is used in plurality voting, VoteFair ranking always produces results that are supported by a majority of voters &#8212; who express a preference.&#160; This issue of achieving a majority outcome guarantees that no other candidate is preferred by more voters.</p> 
<p>Except in the uncommon case of a tie and some rare cases of circular ambiguity, <b>VoteFair ranking always achieves a majority outcome</b>. This characteristic reveals the fairness of VoteFair ranking.&#160; In contrast, <b>plurality voting and instant-runoff voting can easily produce results in which the winning candidate is not preferred by a majority of voters</b>.</p> 
<h1>Good, Better, Best</h1> 
<p>To further appreciate the fairness of VoteFair ranking, let's consider a situation in which plurality voting and instant-runoff voting identify the wrong winner.&#160; Of course VoteFair ranking identifies the correct winner.&#160; This example also reveals what kind of candidates are really the most popular.</p> 
<p>Again let's suppose the election is between Selden, Meredith, Elliot, and Roland.&#160; The voter preferences in this example are conveyed in the illustration below.</p>

<p>Who would win this election according to plurality voting?&#160; Selden because he has the most first-choice votes.</p> 
<p>Who would win this election according to instant-runoff voting?&#160; Elliot.&#160; Let's see why.&#160; Roland would be eliminated in the first round because he receives no first-choice votes.&#160; In the next round there is a tie situation with Meredith and Elliot having the same number of fewest votes.&#160; If the runoff method is allowed to peek at the alternate preferences and see that more voters prefer Elliot than Meredith, Meredith would be eliminated in the second round.&#160; Between the remaining two candidates, Selden and Elliot, there are more votes for Elliot, so Elliot would win &#8212; according to instant-runoff voting.</p> 
<p>Who would win this election according to VoteFair ranking?&#160; Roland.&#160; This result comes from letting a computer do the calculations.&#160; Here are the VoteFair ranking results.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>First ranked: Roland</li> 
<li>Second ranked: Elliot</li> 
<li>Third ranked: Selden</li> 
<li>Fourth (last) ranked: Meredith</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Is Roland really the most popular candidate?&#160; Yes.&#160; You can verify this by looking at the voter preferences.&#160; If we look at how many voters prefer Roland over Elliot (as indicated by Roland's name appearing to the left of Elliot's name), we see that 70 voters &#8212; which is more than half &#8212; have this preference.&#160; If we look at how many voters prefer Roland over Selden (as indicated by Roland's name appearing to the left of Selden's name), we see that 60 voters &#8212; which is more than half &#8212; have this preference.&#160; If we look at how many voters prefer Roland over Meredith (as indicated by Roland's name appearing to the left of Meredith's name), we see that 70 voters &#8212; which is more than half &#8212; have this preference.&#160; The result is a clear majority compared to each of the other candidates.</p> 
<p>Is Elliot really the second-most popular?&#160; Yes.&#160; Notice that 60 voters prefer Elliot over Selden, and only 40 voters prefer Selden over Elliot.</p> 
<p>Is Meredith really least popular?&#160; Yes.&#160; Only 40 voters prefer Meredith over Selden, only 30 voters prefer Meredith over Elliot, and only 30 voters prefer Meredith over Roland.</p> 
<p>Now that we know the full ranking, how good are the results based on plurality and instant-runoff voting?&#160; The winner according to plurality voting &#8212; Selden &#8212; is actually the third-most popular candidate.&#160; That's not good.&#160; The winner according to instant-runoff voting &#8212; Elliot &#8212; is actually the second-most popular candidate.&#160; That's better than plurality voting, but it still isn't correct.&#160; Only VoteFair ranking correctly identifies Roland to be the most popular.</p> 
<p>With the unfairness of plurality and instant-runoff voting fresh in your mind, consider that <b>virtually all the voting methods used in all the democracies throughout the world today would fail to correctly identify the most popular candidate in this election</b>.&#160; Is it any surprise that elections commonly fail to elect politicians who are truly representative of what voters want?&#160; And <b>with traditional voting methods being so easy to exploit using tactics that involve money, is it any surprise that politicians have become puppets of the biggest campaign contributors?</b></p> 
<h1>Moderate Or Representative?</h1> 
<p>Perhaps you are thinking that the voter preferences in this example are unrealistic.&#160; Although they are intentionally exaggerated, these preferences are basically realistic.</p> 
<p>To see the potential for realism, suppose the four candidates have these political orientations.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Selden is outwardly charismatic and quietly favors laws that are desired by large corporations.</li> 
<li>Meredith favors protecting the environment in ways that are popular, and expresses a strong desire to improve public education.</li> 
<li>Elliot favors legislation, including medical-insurance reform, that would benefit hard-working employees.</li> 
<li>Roland has a reputation for successfully resolving political conflicts in ways that accommodate most people's interests.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Now let's consider the voters in this election.&#160; Let's suppose they live in an industrial area where they are somewhat equally divided among these three groups.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Corporate executives and managers, investors, and private business owners, all of whom prefer Selden.</li> 
<li>Middle-income people, especially non-minority parents, who prefer Meredith.</li> 
<li>Workers and minorities who prefer Elliot.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Of course these categories are simplistic because many voters would fit into more than one group.&#160; Also, this three-way division is not as dramatic as the well-established two-way division between conservatives and liberals.&#160; Yet this situation is realistic enough to reveal why Roland is not the first choice of any voter, yet overall is the most popular candidate.&#160; This situation also reveals why each group of voters would prefer Roland as their second choice.</p> 
<p>At this point you might conclude that VoteFair ranking favors moderate candidates.&#160; In one sense this assessment is correct.&#160; Yet it is more accurate to say that <b>VoteFair ranking favors candidates who are most representative of what a majority of voters want</b>.&#160; This perspective is validated by the results in the sample election.&#160; Notice that none of the first three candidates represents a majority of voters, each of these three candidates represents only a large minority of voters, and only the fourth conflict-resolving candidate represents the best interests of a majority of voters.</p> 
<p>A valid criticism of using VoteFair ranking is that election results would become less schizophrenic, and therefore less exciting, compared to the current tendency to alternate between political extremes.&#160; But if excitement was a worthwhile goal of government, the best results would be obtained by going back to the days of kings and queens.&#160; It's true that fairness is not exciting.&#160; But for reasons explained in the closing chapter, increased fairness leads to widespread prosperity, and widespread prosperity makes nearly everyone happier.</p> 
<h1>Suspicions</h1> 
<p>What will it take to prove, on a widespread basis, that VoteFair ranking provides fair results?&#160; The most important proof will develop slowly as voters discover they like the results of VoteFair ranking better than the results of traditional voting methods.</p> 
<p>Until VoteFair ranking has proven itself through widespread use, many people will be suspicious of this new voting method.&#160; This suspicion should not only be expected, but encouraged.&#160; In fact, it is wise for people to be suspicious of what they don't understand.&#160; Suspicion leads to rejecting new ideas that deserve to be rejected.</p> 
<p>Fortunately, valuable solutions can survive lots of suspicion, criticism, and rejection.&#160; Useful solutions eventually evolve into valued innovations, and valued innovations eventually become so commonly used that they become new traditions.&#160; This evolutionary nature of creative problem solving reveals the origin of today's valued traditions.</p> 
<h1>VoteFair Ranking In Perspective</h1> 
<p>Where did VoteFair ranking come from?&#160; I invented it.&#160; It would be more precise to say that I discovered it because I'm aware that sooner or later someone else would surely arrive at the same insights.</p> 
<p>[Update:&#160; After publishing the print edition of this book, I learned that in 1959 a mathematician named John Kemeny published a method that does different calculations, yet yields the same results.&#160; Instead of basing the sequence scores on how many voters <b>support</b> each sequence and finding the <b>highest</b> score, Kemeny's method bases the scores on how many voters <b>oppose</b> each sequence and finding the <b>lowest</b> score.&#160; This means that the sequence that has the highest VoteFair sequence score is the same sequence that has the lowest Kemeny sequence score.&#160; The Kemeny method is now typically described using the VoteFair method.&#160; The name <i><b>Condorcet-Kemeny method</b></i> covers both methods as if they are the same method.]</p> 
<p>I created VoteFair ranking while writing my first book, which is titled <i><b>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</b></i>.&#160; That book describes how to create solutions to real-life problems of any kind.</p> 
<p>While writing that book I wanted to make sure the techniques I was describing were powerful enough to create solutions for even the most challenging of problems.&#160; So I tested the techniques on many challenging real-life problems.&#160; I came to recognize that there are two especially important problems currently facing the United States.&#160; Obviously one of these problems is that voters are unable to elect the kind of leaders they want, namely people who are able and willing to solve the many economic and political problems that remain unsolved &#8212; as a result of campaign contributions excessively influencing election results.&#160; The other important problem is the need to dramatically improve the quality of public education.</p> 
<p>Using the techniques I described in <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i>, I arrived at a series of insights.&#160; It was obvious that a fair voting method must take into account all the preferences of all the voters.&#160; After various attempts I realized that a fair voting method also must reveal the second-most popular choice, the third-most popular choice, and so on, in addition to identifying the most popular choice.</p> 
<p>[Update: One of the approaches I considered was to look for the biggest and smallest numbers in the tally table.&#160; I rejected that approach because it has the same basic weakness as instant-runoff voting, namely it focuses on big and small numbers without looking more deeply at all the numbers.&#160; Later (in 1997) a German mathematician named Markus Schulze developed such a method and he promotes it under the name the <i><b>Schulze method</b></i>.&#160; That method almost always yields the same winner as VoteFair ranking.&#160; However the method's only notable advantage over VoteFair ranking is that it achieves a mathematical criterion (<i>cloneproof</i>) that becomes irrelevant in the rare cases when VoteFair ranking does not achieve that mathematical criterion.&#160; Very significantly the method was not designed to reveal the overall popularity ranking, and when the method is used repeatedly as a way to calculate a full ranking, it sometimes fails to correctly rank all the choices.&#160; Software that implements the method is easier to write, so that software became available sooner, so some organizations adopted the <i><b>Condorcet-Schulze method</b></i> early, and other organizations have copied that move.&#160; Another disadvantage of the method is that it is unnecessarily difficult to understand.&#160; There are yet other Condorcet method<i><b>s</b></i> that also look for the biggest and smallest numbers (either in the tally table or in runoff-based numbers), and they too yield similar results for the most popular candidate, but none of them correctly ranks all the candidates from most popular to least popular.]</p> 
<p>My background in using mathematics as a part of getting a university degree in physics provided an advantage in arriving at the method I now call VoteFair ranking.&#160; My experience as a computer programmer enabled me to write software that performs the ranking calculations.&#160; My experience as a technical writer enabled me to simplify my explanations of how the method works, and why it produces fairer results.</p> 
<p>In <i>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</i> I briefly described the ranking method as an example of one of the creative-problem-solving techniques.&#160; Later I developed software to make the computations of VoteFair ranking available, for free, through the website at VoteFair.org.</p> 
<p>To satisfy my own curiosity I wrote a proposed constitutional amendment that would implement VoteFair ranking in Presidential elections.&#160; About a year later I began to become aware that the proposed amendment overlooked some important aspects of elections, especially the tendency of voters to split up into lots of small political parties.&#160; Over the next two years I expanded the amendment and realized there was a need for a book that describes how VoteFair ranking works and how to use it in real elections.&#160; It took another five years to write this book.&#160; While writing it I became aware of yet more subtleties and complexities of elections, so this book and VoteFair ranking grew as a result.</p> 
<p>[Update:&#160; After publishing the print edition of this book, I developed an open-source version of the VoteFair ranking software.&#160; It and a companion utility named Vote-Info-Split-Join are available for free at the GitHub.com website (under the username CPSolver).&#160; The open-source version speeds up the calculations (using a variation of the <i>insertion sort</i> algorithm and a successive-elimination process) so that VoteFair ranking results can be calculated quickly even when there are hundreds of choices.&#160; The design for the marble machine described in the next section is another recent development.]</p> 
<h1>VoteFair Marble Machine</h1> 
<p>Another way to understand VoteFair ranking is to watch a marble machine that implements this counting method.&#160; The design for a VoteFair marble machine is posted at the VoteFair.org website (<a href="http://www.VoteFair.org/votefair_marble_machine.html" title="www.VoteFair.org/votefair_marble_machine.html" class="classLink">www.VoteFair.org/votefair_marble_machine.html</a>).&#160; When someone builds this marble machine and makes a video of it in action, a link to that video will be added to that VoteFair web page.</p> 
<p>The marble machine handles three choices.&#160; For example, if the voting is done to find out the popularity of ice-cream flavors, the three choices might be <i>chocolate</i>, <i>vanilla</i>, and <i>strawberry</i>.&#160; Each of these labels appears over a funnel-shaped opening.</p> 
<p>When a voter is at the machine, he or she grabs the three large marbles that wait in a dispenser.&#160; Then the voter puts the first marble into the funnel labeled with their favorite flavor.&#160; Next, the voter puts the second marble into the funnel labeled with their second-favorite flavor.&#160; Finally, although it isn't really necessary, the voter puts the last marble into the funnel labeled with their least-favorite flavor.</p> 
<p>These large marbles travel down the machine and knock smaller (normal-size) marbles off of platforms.&#160; The large marbles return to the dispenser, ready for the next voter.&#160; Each smaller marble travels down through a tube that deposits it into one of six clear jars.</p> 
<p>Each of the six jars is labeled with one of the six possible sequences.&#160; In this ice-cream flavor example, the six jars would be labeled:</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Jar 1:&#160; chocolate, vanilla, strawberry</li> 
<li>Jar 2:&#160; chocolate, strawberry, vanilla</li> 
<li>Jar 3:&#160; vanilla, chocolate, strawberry</li> 
<li>Jar 4:&#160; vanilla, strawberry, chocolate</li> 
<li>Jar 5:&#160; strawberry, chocolate, vanilla</li> 
<li>Jar 6:&#160; strawberry, vanilla, chocolate</li> 
</ul> 
<p>After all the voters have cast their votes, the jar that contains the most marbles &#8220;wins.&#8221;&#160; In other words, the label on the fullest jar reveals which choice is most popular, which choice is second-most popular, and which choice is least popular.</p> 
<p>The only moving part (besides the marbles) is a mechanism that is rotated with a crank or lever before each voter deposits their large marbles.&#160; The rotating mechanism supplies one small marble to each of nine platforms.&#160; Why nine?&#160; The first large marble knocks six small marbles off their platforms, and the second large marble knocks three small marbles off their platforms.&#160; When the last marble goes through the machine it does not knock off any marbles because all nine marbles already have been knocked off.</p> 
<p>Each small marble on a platform can be knocked off to the left by a large marble coming from the right, or can be knocked off to the right by a large marble coming from the left.&#160; This amounts to doing a pairwise comparison, where the first large marble to reach a small marble determines which of two directions the small marble goes.</p> 
<p>Suppose a voter puts their first large marble into the funnel labeled <i>vanilla</i>.&#160; That large marble will knock two small marbles into jar 3, another two small marbles into jar 4, one small marble into jar 1, and one more small marble into jar 6.&#160; And suppose the same voter puts their second large marble into the funnel labeled <i>strawberry</i>.&#160; That second large marble will hit the remaining three small marbles into jars 4, 5, and 6.&#160; At this point jar 4 will have the most marbles (three) and that matches that voter's preference.</p> 
<p>As more voters vote, some jars will collect more marbles and other jars will collect fewer marbles.&#160; When all the voters have voted, the jar with the most marbles reveals the full popularity ranking.</p> 
<p>In other words, the VoteFair marble machine does pairwise comparisons.&#160; But instead of doing the calculations using computer software, it does the calculations using marbles.&#160; This makes it possible to physically see the calculations as they are being done.</p> 
<p>It also demonstrates the simplicity of VoteFair ranking.&#160; Of course plurality voting and approval voting can be implemented even more simply, just by having one jar for each choice.&#160; But those results are not as fair as VoteFair ranking.&#160; If instant-runoff voting or any other Condorcet method (besides VoteFair ranking) were implemented as a marble machine, the machine would require multiple moving parts that perform extra steps after the voting finishes.&#160; And, as already explained, none of those other methods reveal which choice is actually second-most popular, and which choice is actually least popular.&#160; In contrast, the VoteFair marble machine calculates the full popularity ranking in spite of having only one moving part (besides the marbles).</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; Start by using the VoteFair.org website to try out VoteFair ranking.&#160; (Using it is free, and it doesn't ask for any identifying information.)&#160; After entering the names of imaginary (or real) candidates, you can randomly mark a few ranked ballots, and then immediately receive the VoteFair results for that imaginary election.&#160; The results indicate the overall popularity of your candidates based on the ballots you marked.&#160; The results also include a filled-out tally table, and indications of who would win according to plurality, instant-runoff, and other voting methods.</p> 
<p>After you have experimented with VoteFair ranking, look for opportunities to recommend using VoteFair ranking in surveys and small-group elections.</p> 
<p>Tell other interested people about VoteFair ranking and why it produces results that are much fairer.&#160; It is useful to emphasize that VoteFair ranking makes use of <b>all</b> the preferences of <b>all</b> the voters, which is not true of even instant-runoff voting.&#160; Also emphasize that the results reveal the overall popularity of all the choices, which goes far beyond just identifying a winning candidate.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 13:&#160; Simple Votin':&#160; Fair Elections In Simple Situations</h1> 
<p>It's easy to use VoteFair ranking to elect the president or treasurer of a small organization, or to vote by smartphone for contestants in a talent contest.&#160; This chapter explores these simple situations where political parties are not involved.</p> 
<h1>Electing Officials In Small Organizations</h1> 
<p>How can VoteFair ranking, in conjunction with ranked ballots, be used to elect officials in a small organization?&#160; If the organization is small enough for political parties to be irrelevant, simply use VoteFair ranking just as you would expect.&#160; In particular, conduct the election using the same steps that are used in traditional plurality voting except for these differences.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Assuming the election involves a race with more than just two candidates, ranked ballots (rather than single-mark ballots) must be created.</li> 
<li>Voters need to be taught how to mark ranked ballots.</li> 
<li>The preference information collected on the ballots must be supplied to computer software that calculates VoteFair results.&#160; Note that a free service of calculating VoteFair results is available at the VoteFair.org website.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>It's as simple as that!&#160; The results reveal which candidate is most popular, and this person should be declared the winner.&#160; VoteFair results also reveal which candidate is second-most popular, third-most popular, and so on, but these results aren't used in this simple kind of voting.</p> 
<h1>Collecting Preferences</h1> 
<p>Shown below is an example of a ranked ballot for this simple kind of voting where political parties are not involved.&#160; You can make a similar kind of ballot for your needs.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_269_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 269" width="411" height="750"/></p> 
<p>Ranked ballots can be printed on paper, or implemented on a web page (if security and Internet access are not significant issues).&#160; In either case, consider using the VoteFair.org website to assist you in creating a basic ballot as a starting point.&#160; Ballot information also can be collected using email messages, voice-mail messages, or ballots displayed on smartphones.&#160; Offering a combination of these voting methods also may be appropriate.</p> 
<p>Printed ballots are the most confusing for voters because, unlike interactive ballots on websites, there are no constraints about what can and cannot be marked.&#160; To assist voters using printed ballots you may want to include these answers to frequently asked questions in your written instructions.</p> 
<p>Question:&#160; How do I indicate that one of the candidates is totally unacceptable?</p> 
<p>Answer:&#160; Leave all of that candidate's ovals unmarked.&#160; Or if you have expressed a full order of preference for all the other candidates, mark that candidate as your least-preferred choice.</p> 
<p>Question:&#160; How is the ballot interpreted if a candidate receives no mark?</p> 
<p>Answer:&#160; That candidate is regarded as being less-preferred than any candidates in the same race who receive a mark.</p> 
<p>Question:&#160; How is the ballot interpreted if a candidate receives more than one mark?</p> 
<p>Answer:&#160; The left-most mark indicates the preference level of that candidate.</p> 
<p>Question:&#160; How can I fix a mistake in my marks?</p> 
<p>Answer:&#160; If you have marked the ovals with a pencil, erase the unwanted marks.&#160; If you have marked the ballot with a pen, you need to get a new ballot and start over.</p> 
<p>Question:&#160; Can two or more candidates in the same race be marked at the same preference level?</p> 
<p>Answer:&#160; Yes.&#160; This simply means you regard the candidates as equally preferred.&#160; However, marking candidates in this way is equivalent to leaving it up to other voters to determine the relative popularity of these candidates.</p> 
<p>Question:&#160; How is the ballot interpreted if one or more of the preference levels is skipped?</p> 
<p>Answer:&#160; Any gaps in the marking of preference levels are meaningless.&#160; The ballots are counted in a way that ignores this and any other attempts to increase a voter's influence on the results.</p> 
<p>Question:&#160; How are the numbers inside the ovals used to calculate the results?</p> 
<p>Answer:&#160; The numbers inside the ovals are not used in any aspect of calculating the results.&#160; The numbers are just to help voters keep track of which column each oval is in.</p> 
<p>Although some voters (especially the ones who don't read instructions) might get confused about how to mark ranked ballots, most voters quickly recognize they are finally being allowed to express what they have always wanted to be able to express on a ballot.</p> 
<h1>Doing The Math</h1> 
<p>If voting is done digitally &#8212; such as through a web page or a smartphone app &#8212; the preference information can be supplied automatically to software that does the VoteFair ranking calculations.&#160; Otherwise the preference information on printed ballots or other sources must be entered manually into the software.</p> 
<p>If people in your organization do not trust calculations done on a distant computer, and if a computer programmer is available to help out, the programmer can download the open-source VoteFair ranking software from GitHub within the CPSolver account, and follow the included instructions to run the calculations on a local computer.&#160; (The instructions explain how to run the software on a PC, Mac, or Linux computer.)</p> 
<p>Obviously the candidate who VoteFair ranking identifies as most popular should be declared the winner.&#160; If two or more candidates are tied as most popular, traditional methods can be used to resolve the tie.&#160; For example, a coin can be flipped or the organization's outgoing treasurer or president can cast a tie-breaking ballot.&#160; <b>To ensure that a tie-breaking ballot will definitely break the tie, the person casting the tie-breaking ballot must not mark any of the candidates as being equally preferred</b>.</p> 
<p>If the election results might be controversial, the numbers in the tally table should be made available to all the voters after the election.&#160; This can be done by posting the printed results, or by making the results available on a web page.&#160; These numbers allow a voter to confirm that the winning candidate is preferred by more voters compared to any of the other candidates.</p> 
<h1>Biggest Challenge</h1> 
<p><b>The biggest challenge in using ranked ballots is for voters to learn how to judge their preferences for candidates</b>.&#160; Of course voters have lots of practice identifying their most-preferred choice.&#160; And most voters can easily identify which candidate they dislike the most.</p> 
<p>Yet some voters may need to vote in a few elections using ranked ballots before they become comfortable identifying their intermediate preferences for candidates.&#160; Fortunately, most voters quickly learn how to think in this way after they have been given the opportunity.</p> 
<p>If learning to think beyond the first choice seems like a trivial skill to learn, consider that when telephone answering machines were first introduced, it took a few years for most people to learn how to talk to those machines.</p> 
<h1>Excessive Fairness</h1> 
<p>In very small organizations it is rare to have more than two candidates in a race because the biggest challenge is getting somebody to volunteer for a position.&#160; <b>When there are only two candidates, it is pointless to use VoteFair ranking because the results are the same as using plurality voting</b>.</p> 
<p><b>VoteFair ranking may not be necessary when all the voters are gathered together in the same room, there are only three or four candidates, and voting for officials is done using a show of hands</b>.&#160; In this situation a variation of instant-runoff voting, which can be called immediate runoff voting, can produce results that are usually, although not always, fair.&#160; This method is described in the next section.</p> 
<p>It is important to remember that fairness is not the only consideration in elections.&#160; <b>In informal situations, convenience may be more important than fairness</b>.&#160; Also consider that your standards for fairness may be higher than what other people in the organization care to achieve.&#160; So if you recommend using VoteFair ranking and discover lots of resistance, reconsider your goals.</p> 
<p>Ultimately <b>the most important reason for using VoteFair ranking in a small organization</b> is to help people learn about VoteFair ranking as a fairer way to conduct elections, and learn how to mark ranked ballots.&#160; There should be an emphasis on learning, not just on issues of fairness.&#160; The purpose of this learning <b>is to prepare citizens for opportunities to adopt VoteFair ranking in political situations</b> &#8212; where the issue of fairness is very important.</p> 
<h1>Immediate Runoff Voting</h1> 
<p>What is <b>immediate runoff voting</b>?&#160; It <b>is equivalent to instant-runoff voting except that voter preferences are expressed by a show of hands as they are needed</b>.&#160; In contrast, instant-runoff voting collects all the preferences of all the voters before beginning to determine the results.</p> 
<p>As in instant-runoff voting, multiple rounds of voting are conducted until one of the candidates receives a majority of votes.&#160; Between the rounds of voting, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated.</p> 
<p>An advantage of immediate runoff voting &#8212; over instant-runoff voting &#8212; is that if a round of voting produces a tie for the fewest votes, a special round of voting can be used to determine which of the tied candidates should be eliminated.&#160; Of course if voting gets this messy, the fairness of VoteFair ranking should be considered.</p> 
<p>Immediate runoff voting provides a convenient alternative in situations where access to VoteFair-ranking software through the Internet is not available.&#160; As with instant-runoff voting, <b>immediate runoff voting produces results that are fairer than plurality voting</b>.</p> 
<h1>Making It Official</h1> 
<p>Most small organizations operate under rules or bylaws, so officially adopting ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking might require making changes in these rules or bylaws.</p> 
<p>If the organization officially follows <i><b>Roberts Rules of Order</b></i>, an official change may be needed, depending on how those rules are interpreted.&#160; <b>In Roberts Rules of Order the rules about voting specify achieving a majority, but the rules do not specify how to achieve that majority when there are three or more choices</b>.&#160; The rules ideally recommend multiple rounds of voting without any candidates being eliminated between rounds, with the hope that voters will eventually arrive at a compromise candidate.&#160; Some versions of the rules recommend instant-runoff voting as a tolerable, but less-acceptable, method.&#160; VoteFair ranking results include the tally table, so <b>if the tally-table numbers indicate a majority preference for the most popular candidate, VoteFair ranking results are compatible with the majority requirement</b>.&#160; If a result is controversial, the original ballots can be counted to verify that the number of voters who prefer the winning candidate over the second-most popular candidate exceed the number of voters with the opposite preference.&#160; If the result is still controversial and only one non-winning candidate is a reasonable alternative, a two-candidate round of voting can be used to verify that a majority of voters prefer the most popular choice.</p> 
<p>If an organization's rules or bylaws need to be changed to accommodate VoteFair ranking, below is a wording for a rule that can be adopted for this purpose.&#160; It applies to electing the organization's president, treasurer, and secretary (and any similar officer).&#160; It does not specify how candidates are nominated because traditional nomination methods are usually fair.&#160; Of course the wording should be modified as necessary to fit the needs of a specific organization.</p> 
<p class="classQuote">&#8220;After the candidates for the offices have been nominated, the officers of this organization shall be elected as follows.&#160; Eligible members shall be given ballots that contain the names of the candidates grouped according to their desired office.&#160; To the right of each name shall be markable locations, such as empty ovals, arranged in columns labeled <i>First choice</i>, <i>Second choice</i>, <i>Third choice</i>, and so on, progressing from left to right.&#160; Each voter shall mark these locations on their ballot to indicate their first choice, second choice, third choice, and so on for each office.&#160; The left-most mark among multiple marks given to the same candidate shall be used as the voter's preference level.&#160; More than one candidate can be marked at the same preference level.&#160; The absence of a mark for a candidate indicates the lowest preference.&#160; VoteFair ranking, as explained below, shall be used to identify the most popular candidate for each office, and the most popular candidate for each office shall win the election for that office.&#160; If there is a tie for first place, the counting of votes and the VoteFair ranking shall be repeated.&#160; If the recount also indicates a tie, the outgoing Treasurer [or some other designated official] shall choose how to resolve the tie.&#8221;</p> 
<p class="classQuote">&#8220;VoteFair ranking shall be done using software (such as at VoteFair.org or GitHub.com) that performs the following calculations.&#160; The preferences indicated in the ballots are counted to produce a tally table in which all the possible pairs of candidates are listed, one number for each pair indicates the number of voters who prefer one candidate in the pair over the other candidate in the pair, another number for each pair indicates the number of voters who have the opposite preference for these two candidates, and a third number for each pair indicates the number of voters who express no preference between the two candidates.&#160; Using a computer, each possible sequence of candidates is considered, where a sequence consists of one of the candidates being regarded as the most popular candidate, another candidate being regarded as the second-most popular candidate, and so on.&#160; For each such sequence the numbers in the tally table that apply to that sequence are added together to produce a sequence score for this sequence.&#160; The sequence that has the highest sequence score indicates the overall order of preference for the candidates.&#160; If there is more than one sequence that has the same highest score, the sequences with this score shall be analyzed to identify one or more ties at one or more preference levels.&#8221;</p> 
<h1>Less Formal Possibilities</h1> 
<p>There are other, less formal, situations in which VoteFair ranking can be used to improve fairness.&#160; Contests are a good example.</p> 
<p><b>In a contest of any kind the way to get fair results is to allow voters to indicate secondary preferences in addition to first-choice votes</b>.</p> 
<p>Suppose a television show allows viewers to vote &#8212; by telephone &#8212; for singers competing for a recording contract, and the competition involves several or more contestants.&#160; Sound familiar?&#160; It's the format of the American Idol television show.</p> 
<p>It's worth noting that some of American Idol's voting results have nicely demonstrated the unfairness of plurality voting, which is what the show uses (except that a voter can vote multiple times).&#160; In season 5 the top three singers were two male singers (Taylor Hicks and Elliott Yamin) and one female singer (Katharine McPhee), and vote splitting between the two male singers caused one of the male singers (Yamin) to be eliminated, even though he was more popular than the female singer.</p> 
<p>When contest voting is done by telephone, 1-2-3 voting can be done by dialing a special telephone number and pressing digit keys in the sequence in which the contestants are preferred (although if there are more than nine contestants, some complexities arise).&#160; Telephone voting is vulnerable to power voting which refers to voting many times.&#160; Fortunately each call to a toll-free telephone number tracks the originating telephone number, and there are ways to analyze the calls to minimize the influence of power voting.</p> 
<p>For shows such as American Idol that stretch the competition over many weeks &#8212; and many commercials &#8212; VoteFair ranking can be used to identify the least-popular contestants, and these are the contestants who deserve to be eliminated.&#160; Although VoteFair ranking also reveals the show's most popular contestant, that information would not be revealed because it would spoil the suspense &#8212; and the show's ratings.&#160; <b>If VoteFair ranking is used to identify the least-popular contestants in each round of voting, and these are the contestants who are eliminated, the final winner is truly the most popular</b>.&#160; Of course complete fairness is ultimately elusive because the audience changes each week, people's opinions change, and the effects of power voting cannot be completely eliminated.&#160; Also remember that the purpose of a contest is to provide entertainment, and fairness is not always as entertaining as unfairness.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; Look for opportunities to recommend using VoteFair ranking in situations that do not involve political parties.&#160; Here are some opportunities that may arise.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Electing officers in an organization.&#160; However, if there are just one or two candidates for each position, plurality voting works fine.&#160; If there are three or four candidates and convenience is more important than fairness, remember that instant-runoff voting and runoff voting by a show of hands (immediate runoff voting) may provide adequately fair results.</li> 
<li>Voting in talent contests.&#160; These situations can use VoteFair ranking to rank all the contestants in a single voting process.&#160; As many elimination rounds as desired can be accommodated by not revealing the full VoteFair results.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Remember to not get too focused on fairness in situations where fairness is not as important as convenience or entertainment.&#160; Keep in mind that <b>the main reason for recommending VoteFair ranking is to educate people about this fairer voting method</b>.&#160; The sooner lots of people learn about VoteFair ranking, the sooner it will be adopted for use in governmental elections &#8212; where fairness is very important.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 14:&#160; Nobody Here:&#160; Decision-Making, And Ranking Choices That Aren't Candidates</h1> 
<p>So far the choices you've seen on ranked ballots have been the names of people.&#160; Yet VoteFair ranking also can be used to make decisions in which the alternatives are things such as travel destinations, logo designs, and activities to fund.&#160; The fact that VoteFair ranking reveals the relative popularity of each and every choice also makes it useful for ranking things, such as budget categories, where the goal is not to identify a single winner.</p> 
<h1>Decision-Making Challenges</h1> 
<p>Meetings in corporations and other organizations often involve making decisions on yes-or-no issues such as whether or not to pursue a particular activity.&#160; In these simple two-choice cases virtually every voting method, including VoteFair ranking and plurality voting, produces fair results.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, many people are not aware of the unfair results that can easily arise when voting involves three or more choices.&#160; As a result, small organizations and small groups of people often make the mistake of using plurality voting or runoff voting to choose from among three or more choices.</p> 
<p><b>VoteFair ranking offers fair results in decision-making situations where there are three or more choices</b>.&#160; Here are a few examples of situations in which the choices are not people.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>An organization choosing a new logo or slogan.</li> 
<li>An organization choosing which one of several projects or activities to fund.</li> 
<li>A large family democratically choosing where to go on a family vacation.</li> 
<li>A group of musicians choosing a name for their musical group.&#160; (This was the second real-life situation in which VoteFair ranking was used.)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>To see how VoteFair ranking works when the alternatives are not people, let's consider such an example.&#160; Suppose a city named Throckmorton wants to choose a city slogan, and four slogans have been nominated.&#160; Instead of asking city residents to fill out ballots, let's suppose volunteers use telephones to call randomly selected city residents and ask them for their preferences.&#160; The volunteers then translate these preferences into marks on ballots such as this one.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_280_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 280" width="580" height="377"/></p> 
<p>Based on this preference information, VoteFair ranking would correctly identify the most popular slogan.&#160; Let's suppose the most popular slogan is Capital of Cow Country.&#160; (This is the actual city slogan for Throckmorton Texas.)&#160; VoteFair ranking would also reveal the second-most popular slogan, third-most popular slogan, and the least-popular slogan.&#160; The full popularity ranking would be published online, but of course only the most popular slogan would be declared the winner.</p> 
<p>To appreciate the fairness of VoteFair ranking, consider what might have happened if plurality voting had been used in this survey.&#160; The city residents who prefer a slogan that includes the word <i><b>cow</b></i> would probably be split regarding which of the first three slogans to choose.&#160; As a result, the fourth choice, which does <b>not</b> include this word, could easily have won simply because it attracts support from the fewer residents who dislike the word <i><b>cow</b></i> in the slogan.</p> 
<h1>Special Consideration For Doing Nothing</h1> 
<p>Notice that the city-slogan example does not include a none-of-the-above option, yet many city residents might prefer not to have a city slogan at all.&#160; Or if the city already has a slogan, many residents might prefer the existing slogan over the most popular of the proposed slogans.</p> 
<p>In contrast, notice that <b>a do-nothing alternative is not a possibility when candidates compete for a government office</b>.&#160; In such elections the do-nothing alternative would amount to leaving a governmental office vacant.&#160; Although some voters would love to mark a choice labeled <i><b>None of the above</b></i> and might like the idea of leaving a governmental office vacant, this alternative is not realistic.</p> 
<p><b>If doing nothing</b> &#8212; such as keeping things as they are, not going anywhere, or not spending any money &#8212; <b>is a realistic alternative that should be offered to voters, voting must be handled in a special way</b>.</p> 
<p>To appreciate the need for this special treatment, consider the confusion that arises if a do-nothing alternative is offered on a ranked ballot.&#160; Shown below is what such a ballot would look like for the Throckmorton city-slogan survey.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_282_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 282" width="580" height="474"/></p> 
<p>As you can see by the way this ballot is marked, <b>the presence of a do-nothing alternative on a ballot confuses voters</b>.&#160; The voter who marked this ballot is attempting to say that the slogan <b>The Cow Town</b> is acceptable, but all the other proposed slogans are not acceptable.&#160; This is an attempt to use strategic voting to block the disliked choices.&#160; This strategy does not accomplish what is intended.&#160; Instead, marking a ballot this way leaves the voter unrepresented in the comparison of the three unwanted choices.</p> 
<p>To avoid this confusion, a better approach is to <b>first determine the popularity of the proposed change-based alternatives, and then use a second round of voting in which the most popular change-based alternative competes against the do-nothing alternative</b>.&#160; The ballot shown below demonstrates this second round of voting for the city-slogan example.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_283_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 283" width="580" height="275"/></p> 
<p>This two-step approach produces fairer results.&#160; Why?&#160; Because <b>it is difficult for most people to accurately rank a do-nothing choice</b>.&#160; In particular, most people don't fully understand their preferences regarding actions until they are faced with a choice between doing something specific and doing nothing.&#160; <b>Separating the decisions into two separate rounds of voting helps the voters express their true preferences</b>, and more accurate preference information increases the fairness of the results.</p> 
<p>An added benefit of the two-step approach is that it increases confidence in the results.&#160; This occurs because the final decision is obviously supported by a majority of voters.&#160; Note that <b>if VoteFair ranking is used with a single ballot that includes the do-nothing alternative, the results would also be based on a majority</b>, but this majority basis is not obvious.</p> 
<p>There is another reason for giving special attention to a do-nothing alternative.&#160; <b>In many situations doing nothing is a safer choice than doing something</b>.&#160; Obviously there are situations, such as when driving a car or facing a military enemy, when doing nothing is not necessarily the safest choice.&#160; But when a group of people are using voting to choose what action to take, doing nothing &#8212; at least temporarily &#8212; is often the best choice until there is agreement about which action is best.&#160; Safety deserves this extra consideration.</p> 
<p>There is yet another reason for giving special attention to a do-nothing alternative.&#160; <b>If the do-nothing alternative is more popular than any of the action alternatives, this lack of support for the action alternatives suggests there is a better alternative that hasn't yet been offered to the voters</b>.&#160; For example, in the city-slogan situation, if the second round of voting reveals the city residents prefer the existing slogan over the most popular proposed slogan, this does not mean that the residents are necessarily opposed to changing the city slogan.&#160; It means that none of the proposed slogans are good enough to replace the existing one.&#160; If sometime in the future a better slogan is suggested, that better slogan might be preferred over the existing slogan.</p> 
<p>Ultimately, if a take-action choice is really better than doing nothing, it will easily win the second, two-choice round of voting.</p> 
<p>One more clarification might be helpful.&#160; This two-choice round of voting is different from a runoff round of voting.&#160; Runoff voting refers to offering the same choices that were available in an earlier round of voting, except that some of the choices have been eliminated.&#160; In contrast, notice that the two-choice round of voting involves an alternative &#8212; namely the do-nothing alternative &#8212; that was not offered in the first round of voting.</p> 
<p><b>When you design ballots for making decisions in which doing nothing (making no change) is an acceptable alternative, you should use two rounds of voting.&#160; In the first round, find out which possible change is the most popular.&#160; In the second round, offer only two choices: the most popular alternative from the first round and the alternative of making no change</b>.</p> 
<h1>Rank 'em</h1> 
<p><b>The fact that VoteFair ranking reveals the second-most popular choice, third-most popular choice, and so on means that VoteFair ranking can be used in situations where voting is seldom used</b>.&#160; Here are examples of situations in which VoteFair ranking can be used to indicate the overall popularity of issues, categories, choices, options, and virtually anything that can be ranked.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>College students ranking budget categories to determine how best to use student-body funds.&#160; (This was the first real-life situation for which VoteFair ranking was used.)</li> 
<li>Business managers working together to rank the importance of several budget categories.</li> 
<li>Music fans ranking songs to produce a more accurate <i>top 10</i> or <i>top 50</i> music ranking.</li> 
<li>Members of a non-profit political organization ranking political issues according to priority, for purposes of scheduling and budgeting.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Basically <b>VoteFair ranking can be used to rank anything</b>.&#160; After all, it simply combines the separate order-of-preference rankings from voters into a single overall order-of-preference ranking.</p> 
<p>To better appreciate this usefulness, let's look at an example in which VoteFair ranking is used to rank the priority of budget categories.&#160; Suppose the student council of a small college wants to find out how students want their student-activity funds spent.&#160; This portion of a survey would allow these preferences to be collected.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_285_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 285" width="580" height="372"/></p> 
<p>Let's suppose VoteFair ranking reveals this ranking of importance based on the preferences marked on the ballots.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>First-ranked: Educational speakers</li> 
<li>Second-ranked: Scholarships for conferences</li> 
<li>Third-ranked: Outdoor activities (rafting, skiing, etc.)</li> 
<li>Fourth-ranked: Intramural sports</li> 
<li>Fifth-ranked: Out-of-town band performances</li> 
</ul> 
<p>In this case there is not one <i><b>winning</b></i> choice that contrasts with the remaining <i><b>losing</b></i> choices.&#160; Instead, <b>ranking results are used in a general way to guide decisions about how to allocate resources in a way that represents the voters</b>.&#160; In this example the resources are student-activity funds.</p> 
<p>To better appreciate the broad usefulness of VoteFair ranking, each time you encounter the word <i><b>candidate</b></i> (or <i><b>candidates</b></i>) in this book, imagine replacing the word with a phrase such as <i><b>candidate or item or choice</b></i> (or its plural version).&#160; Such a phrase is awkward, and pictures of candidates are more meaningful than symbols that represent <i><b>items</b></i> or <i><b>choices</b></i>.&#160; That's partially why candidates are used in most of the examples throughout this book.&#160; Don't let the focus on candidates stop you from appreciating that VoteFair ranking is also useful for ranking anything that voters can rank.</p> 
<h1>New Uses</h1> 
<p>Ranking items and choices is a relatively new use for voting.&#160; Why?&#160; Because voters and survey participants are typically asked to identify just one choice as their preferred choice, without being allowed to indicate alternate preferences.&#160; This lack of complete preference information makes it impossible to correctly identify the second-most popular choice.&#160; Another reason for the rarity of ranking questions in surveys is that traditional ways of analyzing the answers are simplistic and misleading.</p> 
<p>Hopefully you now recognize that <b>the full order-of-preference results produced by VoteFair ranking opens up many new possibilities for using voting to determine what a large number of people really want</b>.</p> 
<p>As a peek into the future, imagine how voting will commonly be done in corporate and governmental meetings.&#160; Each voter at the meeting will use their smartphone (or cell phone) to enter their preferences.&#160; When all the preferences have been entered, the popularity of each choice will be instantly calculated by a distant computer.&#160; The results will be accessed by the moderator using a smartphone and an access code.&#160; If a projector is available, the results will be displayed visually.&#160; Notice that the recent arrival of computer technology, smartphones, and VoteFair ranking finally makes voting useful as a tool for ranking choices in decision-making situations.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; Look for opportunities to use VoteFair ranking for making decisions and ranking choices.&#160; Here are some opportunities that may arise.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Making a decision such as choosing a new logo, choosing the name of a musical group, choosing which one of several projects or activities to fund, or democratically choosing where to go on a family vacation.&#160; If one of the choices is to do nothing, use a second round of voting to choose between doing nothing and the most popular alternative from the first round of voting.</li> 
<li>Ranking budget categories, projects, music, movies, and virtually anything else that can be ranked.&#160; These opportunities can arise in nearly any situation where a group of people are gathered to make decisions, share opinions, or resolve conflicts.</li> 
<li>Asking ranking-type survey questions at a website.</li> 
<li>Judging entries at a state fair, or conducting a talent contest.&#160; For convenience consider using approval voting to estimate the top four choices, and then use ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking to correctly identify the winners of first, second, and third place.</li> 
</ul> 

<h1>Chapter 15:&#160; Double Dilemma:&#160; Filling A Second Equivalent Seat Representatively</h1> 
<p>When an election involves filling just one position, the most popular candidate &#8212; as identified by VoteFair popularity ranking &#8212; obviously deserves to win.&#160; But some elections, such as for Congressional and legislative seats, involve filling two or more equivalent seats.&#160; In these situations the second-most popular candidate is not necessarily the second-most representative candidate.&#160; In this chapter let's explore how to identify who should win the second seat and any additional equivalent seats.&#160; The resulting approach is called VoteFair representation ranking.</p> 
<h1>Looking Beyond The First Winner</h1> 
<p>In the U.S. Senate, each state is represented by two Senators.&#160; Regardless of how they are elected, after they are elected the two Senators from a state are equivalent, and together they represent the voters in their state.&#160; This situation is different from other kinds of political offices where a single official &#8212; such as a Mayor or Governor &#8212; has full responsibility for representing the citizens in his or her city or state.</p> 
<p>As previously explained (in Chapter 9), a significant lack of fairness easily occurs in Senatorial elections.&#160; For example, suppose a state has 100 voters and 60 of them prefer Republican candidates.&#160; If all the voters are involved in both elections, then both Senators will always be Republicans.&#160; This leaves the other 40 voters unrepresented, even though they make up almost half the state's population.</p> 
<p>One way to avoid this unfair outcome is to divide the state into two Senatorial districts.&#160; This gives the impression of fairness because each Senator supposedly represents the voters in the district that elected the Senator.&#160; However, the results are easily affected by where the district boundaries are placed.&#160; Furthermore, once a Senator is elected, virtually all his or her decisions are based on representing the voters in the state who are from the same political party, and intrastate (within-the-state) geographic differences become irrelevant.</p> 
<p>So how can a state's two Senators be chosen in a way that is fair?&#160; <b>When just two equivalent seats are involved, all the candidates for both seats can compete in the same race</b>.&#160; If this approach is used, obviously the most popular candidate deserves to win one of the two seats.&#160; How should the winner of the second seat be identified?&#160; To answer this question, let's consider an example.</p> 
<p>Let's suppose these three Republicans and three Democrats compete in the same race for a state's two U.S. Senate seats.</p> 
<p>Here is what the ballot for this election would look like.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_291_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 291" width="580" height="412"/></p> 
<p>VoteFair popularity ranking would be used to reveal the popularity of the candidates based on the preferences expressed on these ballots.&#160; Let's suppose VoteFair popularity ranking reveals the most popular candidate to be Selden.&#160; As you would expect, Selden would win the first of the two Senate seats.</p> 
<h1>Loss Of Influence</h1> 
<p>How would the second Senate seat be filled?&#160; The easiest way to understand the answer to this question is to consider some exaggerated situations.</p> 
<p>As usual, let's suppose there are exactly 100 voters.&#160; In this example let's suppose 51 of the voters prefer Republican candidates, the other 49 voters prefer Democratic candidates, and there is no cross-party voting.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_292_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 292" width="580" height="648"/></p> 
<p>The 51 Republican voters are already represented by the Republican who wins the first seat (Selden).&#160; So in this situation it is fair to allow the remaining 49 voters to select the winner of the second Senate seat.&#160; This means the ballots of the 51 Republican voters &#8212; who chose the first winning candidate &#8212; essentially are ignored in order to identify the second-most representative candidate.</p> 
<p>Using this approach, the second seat is filled by a Democrat.&#160; More specifically, the seat is filled by the candidate who is most popular among the 49 voters who prefer Democratic candidates.&#160; For example, if Walter is the most popular candidate among these voters, Walter wins the second Senate seat.</p> 
<p>Notice the fairness of this outcome.&#160; The Republican Senator, Selden, represents the 51 voters who prefer Republican candidates, and the Democratic Senator, Walter, represents the remaining 49 voters who prefer Democratic candidates.</p> 
<h1>Doing It Proportionally</h1> 
<p>Now let's consider a less obvious case.&#160; Let's suppose some Democratic voters in the previous example mysteriously transform into Republicans, and there are now 70 voters who prefer Republican candidates and 30 voters who prefer Democratic candidates.&#160; The illustration below shows these preferences.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_294_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 294" width="580" height="677"/></p> 
<p>The same 51 Republican voters are numerous enough to again elect the same Republican candidate, Selden, to the first Senate seat.&#160; When we try to identify the second-most representative candidate, would it be fair to ignore the 70 ballots from the Republican voters?&#160; Of course not.</p> 
<p>As a first step toward fairness, consider the possibility of ignoring 50 out of the 70 voters who prefer Republican candidates.&#160; Why 50?&#160; Because it's almost equal to 51, and that's how many voters it takes to provide a majority of votes for the winning candidate.&#160; If we ignore those 50 ballots, there are still 20 ballots from Republican voters.&#160; These 20 ballots combined with the 30 ballots from the Democratic voters would give us 50 ballots on which to base the winner of the second seat.</p> 
<p>Would this approach be fair?&#160; It would be somewhat fair because, in this case, Republican voters obviously deserve some influence over who wins the second seat.&#160; Of course this approach is unfair because the result is affected by which 50 Republican ballots are ignored and which 20 Republican ballots continue to be considered.</p> 
<p>Fortunately the magic of mathematics provides a fair way to eliminate the unfair aspect of this approach.&#160; Instead of ignoring some Republican ballots and considering others, the influence of all 70 ballots can be reduced.&#160; Magically the reduction can be done in a way that compresses the preferences of all 70 Republican voters into the equivalent of 20 ballots.</p> 
<p>This reduction can be done using subtraction and division.&#160; If you don't like mathematics, feel free to ignore the remainder of this paragraph knowing that voters never need to do these calculations.&#160; For those of you who want to understand the reduction, here is the explanation.&#160; Start with the number of voters who prefer Republican candidates (which is 70 in this case).&#160; Subtract half the number of voters (which is 50 in this case).&#160; The result (20 in this case) represents the ballot-number-based influence deserved by the Republican voters for identifying the second winner in this example.&#160; Next, divide the ballot-number-based influence number (20 in this case) by the number of Republican voters (70 in this case).&#160; The result (which is approximately 0.29; an amount between one-fourth and one-third) is the fraction of a vote that each Republican voter gets when the ballots are recounted for identifying the winner of the second seat.</p> 
<p>This example reveals a fair way to identify the second-most representative candidate when a second seat needs to be filled.&#160; In particular, <b>choosing the winner of the second seat involves reducing the influence of voters who are already represented by the first winner.&#160; After making this adjustment, VoteFair popularity ranking is used to identify the most popular candidate among the remaining (non-winning) candidates.&#160; The candidate who is most popular after making this adjustment is elected to the second equivalent seat</b>.</p> 
<h1>Picking Ballots</h1> 
<p>Identifying which voters are well-represented by the first-seat winner is not as simple as categorizing voters as Republicans and Democrats, which is what we've done so far in this example.&#160; Remember that relatively few voters are well-represented by all the agendas of a particular party.&#160; In particular, cross-party preferences must be taken into account.</p> 
<p>To accommodate cross-party preferences, let's not even consider the political parties of voters or candidates when we identify which voters elect the first-seat winner.&#160; As an added benefit, this improvement allows the method to be used in situations where political parties are not involved, such as the election of corporate board members.</p> 
<p>To see how we can ignore party categories, let's start by considering this ballot.&#160; It is from a voter who ranks the winner of the first Senate seat, Selden, as most preferred.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_296_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 296" width="580" height="399"/></p> 
<p>This ballot obviously deserves to be at least partially ignored when choosing the second-seat winner because it clearly contributes to electing the first-seat winner.&#160; If this first-choice criterion was the only basis for reducing the influence of ballots, some voters would adjust their voting strategy.&#160; They would mark a very unpopular candidate as their first choice and then mark their real first choice as their second preference.</p> 
<p>To defeat this strategic attempt to increase influence over the winners of both seats, the criterion for which ballots to ignore needs improvement.&#160; A better method is to consider the relative preference between the first-seat winner and the candidate who is most popular among the voters who don't rank the first-seat winner in first place.&#160; Specifically, <b>the ballots identified for reduced influence are the ballots on which the first-seat winner is preferred over the candidate who is most popular among the voters who do not rank the first-seat winner as their first choice</b>.</p> 
<p>The best way to understand this complex-sounding approach is to break it down into a step-by-step approach.</p> 
<h1>Stepping Fairly Into The Second Seat</h1> 
<p>Here are the steps that correctly identify which candidate deserves to win the second seat.&#160; (If you are not interested in these details, skip over the steps guilt-free.)</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Identify the winner of the first seat using VoteFair popularity ranking.</li> 
<li>Identify the ballots that rank the first-seat winner as their first choice.</li> 
<li>Completely ignore the ballots identified in step 2, and then use VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the most popular candidate based on the remaining ballots.&#160; This candidate will not necessarily win the second seat.&#160; Instead, this candidate is used in step 5 to identify which ballots are from voters who are well-represented by the winner of the first seat.</li> 
<li>Again consider all the ballots.</li> 
<li>Identify the ballots in which the first-seat winner is preferred over the candidate identified in step 3.&#160; This step identifies the ballots from voters who are well-represented by the first-seat winner.&#160; With this criteria the only way for a voter to avoid having his or her ballot identified in this step is to express a preference that significantly reduces the chances that the preferred candidate will win the first seat.</li> 
<li>Proportionally reduce the influence of the ballots identified in step 5.&#160; This reduction uses subtraction and division as explained earlier in this chapter.&#160; This step reduces the influence of the voters who are well-represented by the first-seat winner.</li> 
<li>Based on all the ballots, but with reduced influence for the ballots identified in step 5, use VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the most popular candidate among the remaining (non-winning) candidates.&#160; This candidate is the second-most representative candidate and therefore deserves to win the second seat.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Of course these steps would be done using a computer, which means voters never need to do these steps.&#160; So if this method seems difficult to understand, don't worry about it; someone else will write the computer's instructions.</p> 
<p>Here is what's important to understand: <b>The second-most popular candidate does not necessarily deserve to win the second seat when more than one position (or seat) is open.&#160; Instead, the ballots that most heavily contribute to giving a majority of votes to the winner of the first seat need to be proportionally reduced in influence for the purpose of identifying the second-most representative candidate</b>.</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that <b>the voters who are well-represented by the first-seat winner would not be completely ignored unless they just barely form a majority</b>.&#160; In other words the voters who form the majority still have an appropriate level of influence in choosing the second-seat winner.</p> 
<p>What happens <b>if almost all the voters have the same preferences</b>?&#160; In that case, <b>the second-most representative candidate</b> &#8212; who wins the second seat &#8212; <b>is also the second-most popular candidate</b>.&#160; For example, if there are 90 Republican voters and 10 Democratic voters, the winner of the second seat is the second-most popular candidate, and he or she will be a Republican.&#160; This leaves the 10 Democratic voters appropriately unrepresented, just as occurs under current voting methods.</p> 
<p>So who would win the Senate seat in the contest involving the 70 Republican voters and 30 Democratic voters?&#160; To find out we need to know all the preferences of all the voters.&#160; Let's suppose these preferences are the ones shown in the illustration below.&#160; As a reminder of how these preferences are represented, consider that the 10 voters in the top row prefer Selden as their first choice, Elliot as their second choice, and Meredith as their third choice.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_299_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 299" width="580" height="535"/></p> 
<p>Based on these preferences and VoteFair representation calculations, the winner of the second seat is Walter.&#160; Remember that Selden is the most popular candidate and therefore wins the first seat.</p> 
<p>Is this result fair?&#160; Yes.&#160; If we look at the illustration we see that, together, Selden and Walter are the most representative of nearly all the voters.&#160; Although Walter is not any voter's first choice, he is more consistently preferred over every other candidate &#8212; among the voters who did not elect Selden.&#160; Also notice that this approach is much fairer than the traditional approach of leaving the bottom 30 Democratic voters completely unrepresented.</p> 
<p>Although the winner of the second seat, Walter, is a Democrat, the choice of which Democrat wins is significantly influenced by the 70 Republican voters.&#160; To appreciate this influence, consider that if the Republican voters were completely ignored in choosing the second winner, Roland would have won the second seat.&#160; What's the difference?&#160; Based on the voters' preferences, Walter is probably a conservative Democrat and Roland is probably a liberal Democrat.&#160; In other words, although the 30 Democratic voters are sufficient to get a Democrat elected to the second seat, the preferences of the 70 Republican voters getting compressed into the equivalent of 20 ballots is (in this case) sufficient to elect a conservative Democrat instead of a liberal Democrat.</p> 
<p>If you don't yet clearly understand how these calculations would be done, don't be concerned.&#160; Computers easily handle these calculations.</p> 
<h1>On To The Third, Back To The First</h1> 
<p>For the purposes of improving U.S. elections as described in this book, only the first two positions of this method are needed.&#160; Yet there are more advanced uses for this voting method, including uses that currently only apply to elections in other nations, that require filling more than two seats.</p> 
<p>The simplest way to extend this voting method beyond two seats is simply to start over from the beginning.&#160; Specifically, after identifying the winners of the first and second seats, the winner of the third seat would be the most popular of the remaining candidates, and the winner of the fourth seat would be chosen in basically the same way as the winner of the second seat.</p> 
<p>What kind of results would this produce?&#160; If a situation involves voters who are somewhat equally balanced in their preference for the Republican and Democratic parties, and if the winner of the first seat is a Republican, the winner of the second seat is likely to be a Democrat, the winner of the third seat is likely to be another Republican, and the winner of the fourth seat is likely to be another Democrat.</p> 
<p>In more general terms, the winner of the first seat would represent the majority of voters, the winner of the second seat would represent the <i><b>opposition</b></i> voters (who disagree with the majority opinion), the winner of the third seat would represent the majority, and the winner of the fourth seat would represent the opposition.&#160; In other words, the results basically alternate back and forth in terms of which voters get represented.&#160; This kind of result would represent most of the voters.</p> 
<p>To better represent minorities, this voting method can be enhanced to insert (after each majority and opposition pair of candidates) additional winning candidates who represent minorities who are not yet <i>proportionally</i> represented by the winners of earlier seats.&#160; For example, if the first two seats are filled with candidates who represent 65 percent of the voters, and the remaining 35 percent of the voters agree on who should fill the third seat, then that candidate should win the third seat.&#160; This enhancement is currently being developed and will be added to the open-source VoteFair ranking software available online.</p> 
<h1>Giving It A Name</h1> 
<p>This process of identifying the second-most representative candidate, the third-most representative candidate, and so on, is called <b>VoteFair <i>representation</i> ranking</b>.&#160; The word <i><b>representation</b></i> clarifies that the results are different from VoteFair popularity ranking, which ranks the popularity of candidates.</p> 
<p>As previously explained (in Chapter 12), the general term <i><b>VoteFair ranking</b></i> refers to either <b>VoteFair <i>popularity</i> ranking</b>, <b>VoteFair <i>representation</i> ranking</b> (which have already been described), or <b>VoteFair <i>party</i> ranking</b> (which is described in Chapter 16), with the understanding that whichever type of ranking is appropriate for a situation is the one that should be used.&#160; When in doubt, assume it refers to <b>VoteFair <i>popularity</i> ranking</b>.</p> 
<p>It is important to remember that <b>the most representative candidate is always the most popular candidate</b>.&#160; As a result, if an election involves just one opening &#8212; such as Mayor or Governor &#8212; it doesn't matter whether VoteFair popularity ranking or VoteFair representation ranking is used because they rank the same candidate at the top.&#160; The differences between the methods only involve the ranking of candidates at the second and lower levels (of representation or popularity).</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; When someone sees the popularity rankings produced by VoteFair popularity ranking, don't allow them to make the mistake of thinking that the second-most popular candidate is also the second-most representative candidate.&#160; In particular, point out that the second-most popular candidate may represent the same 51 percent of the voters who prefer the most popular candidate, and this can leave the other 49 percent of the voters unrepresented by either candidate.</p> 
<p>If you find yourself involved in setting up an election in which two or more equivalent seats need to be filled, explain to the other people involved that all the candidates for the equivalent seats should compete together in the same race.&#160; Also explain why the winners of the additional seats should be based on VoteFair representation ranking, not VoteFair popularity ranking.&#160; For identifying the second-most representative candidate in your election, use the free ranking service at the VoteFair.org website.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 16:&#160; It's Party Time!:&#160; Voting For Parties And Keeping Ballots Short</h1> 
<p>Voting for political parties is a new idea for U.&#160; S.&#160; voters, but it is a typical part of voting in many European countries.&#160; In this chapter you will learn why getting fair election results requires that voters indicate their order of preference for political parties.&#160; From these party preferences VoteFair ranking reveals the most popular and representative political parties, and this information can be used to limit, in a fair way, the number of candidates on a ballot.&#160; This limitation makes room on the ballot for two extra candidates from the two top parties.</p> 
<h1>True Party Preferences At Last</h1> 
<p>For most voters in the United States, here is the biggest surprise about what it will take to get fair election results: <b>Voters will see on the ballot a list of political parties, and each voter will be asked to indicate his or her order of preference for the listed political parties</b>.</p> 
<p>To better understand what this means, let's look at an example.&#160; Shown below is a sample ranked ballot for ranking seven political parties.&#160; In this example a voter has marked the ballot to indicate his preference for the listed parties.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_304_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 304" width="580" height="425"/></p> 
<p>In a real election the list of political parties might be long, possibly including as many as 10 or 20 parties.&#160; If such a list seems excessively long, keep in mind that <b>some, or even many, of the listed parties do not have enough support to allow them to have candidates in the races that appear elsewhere on the ballot</b>.&#160; Using a full list of officially registered political parties is necessary to find out when a previously small party has become popular enough to deserve candidates in the next election cycle.</p> 
<p>Even when there are only four or five political parties listed, some voters are likely to be overwhelmed by this number of parties.&#160; Fortunately it's not necessary to mark a preference level for every party.&#160; A voter can just mark their favorite party as their first choice, and perhaps mark their second-favorite party as their second choice.&#160; In this case the other parties are regarded as equally unacceptable, which is typically a valid interpretation.</p> 
<h1>Ranked Parties</h1> 
<p>When order-of-preference information regarding political parties is available, VoteFair ranking reveals the popularity of all the listed parties.&#160; If this ranking were done today, obviously the Republican and Democratic parties would be the two most popular.&#160; Small political parties, such as the Green party and the Libertarian party, would be ranked at lower levels.</p> 
<p>How should <b>the first-ranked political party</b> be identified?&#160; It <b>is the party that is first-most popular according to VoteFair popularity ranking</b>.&#160; VoteFair representation ranking also could be used because the most representative party is also the most popular party.</p> 
<p><b>To correctly identify the second-ranked party, VoteFair representation ranking must be used</b>.&#160; As explained in the previous chapter, the representation version of VoteFair ranking &#8212; rather than the popularity version &#8212; ensures that the same voters who prefer the top-ranked party cannot use their majority influence to also identify the second-ranked party.</p> 
<p>How should <b>the third-ranked political party</b> be identified?&#160; It <b>is identified using two steps.&#160; First, identify the ballots on which the voter's most-preferred party is not one of the two highest-ranked parties.&#160; Second, using only these ballots, use VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the most popular party (excluding any party that has already been ranked)</b>.</p> 
<p>Why not simply choose the next-most popular or next-most representative party?&#160; Because using all the ballots gives too much influence to the same voters who have already chosen the two top parties.&#160; The recommended approach also prevents the usefulness of decoy parties.&#160; A <i><b>decoy party</b></i> (or <i><b>shadow party</b></i>) would have basically the same political agenda as one of the two top parties, and its primary purpose would be to keep other parties off the ballot.&#160; As an example from the sample ballot, the Elephant party might be a decoy party of the Conservative party.</p> 
<p><b>The fourth-ranked party would be identified using VoteFair popularity ranking, with all the ballots being considered.&#160; The remaining party rankings would be identified using VoteFair representation ranking</b>.</p> 
<p>The list below summarizes how the party rankings are determined.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>First-ranked party:&#160; VoteFair first-most popular (which is also VoteFair first-most representative)</li> 
<li>Second-ranked party: VoteFair second-most representative</li> 
<li>Third-ranked party:&#160; VoteFair most-popular based on the ballots for which the most-preferred choice is not one of the above two parties.&#160; (If no ballots fit this criteria, the third-ranked party is the next-most popular party, and the fourth-ranked party is the next-most representative party.)</li> 
<li>Fourth-ranked party:&#160; VoteFair next-most popular (based on all ballots)</li> 
<li>Fifth-ranked party:&#160; VoteFair next-most representative (based on all ballots)</li> 
<li>Sixth-ranked party:&#160; VoteFair next-most representative (based on all ballots)</li> 
<li>Seventh-ranked party:&#160; VoteFair next-most representative (based on all ballots)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>As an example of VoteFair party ranking, here is what the party rankings might look like for the parties listed in the sample ballot.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>First-ranked party: Conservative</li> 
<li>Second-ranked party: Liberal</li> 
<li>Third-ranked party: Labor</li> 
<li>Fourth-ranked party: Green</li> 
<li>Fifth-ranked party: Elephant</li> 
<li>Sixth-ranked party: Solutions</li> 
</ul> 
<h1>When And Where?</h1> 
<p>How often would voters be asked to rank political parties?&#160; Once every other year would be sufficient.&#160; In particular, <b>party ranking should be done in the general election of each even-numbered year</b>.&#160; These party preferences are reasonably accurate for the big general election two years later.&#160; Why the delay?&#160; A politician needs to know in advance whether his or her party is popular enough to enable the politician to be listed on the ballot in upcoming elections.</p> 
<p>Of course party rankings are calculated for each state.&#160; These results are used in elections for Governors and other state offices.&#160; Less obviously, <b>separate party rankings are calculated for each political area from which an official is elected</b>.&#160; For example, a separate city-based party ranking is used in the election of the city's Mayor, and separate district-based rankings are used in each Congressional district.</p> 
<p>Keeping track of separate party rankings, and tracking which voters' preferences contribute to each of these rankings, is easily handled by computers.&#160; This complexity is hidden from voters because <b>a voter only ranks political parties once on the ballot every two years</b>.</p> 
<h1>Nixing Candidates From Trivial Parties</h1> 
<p>How are the party rankings used?&#160; The most basic use is to identify the lowest-ranked parties and exclude those parties from putting their candidates on the ballot.&#160; This means that <b>only the highest-ranked parties would be allowed to have candidates appear on the ballot in a general election</b>.&#160; This limit only applies to general elections because each political party controls its own primary-election races.</p> 
<p>To see how the limit works, let's suppose there is an election for state Governor and only the top four parties are allowed to have candidates in that election.&#160; Using the party names on the ballot near the beginning of this chapter, let's suppose the top four parties (for this race) are the Conservative, Liberal, Green, and Labor parties.&#160; The candidates listed on the ballot for this gubernatorial election would be from only these four parties.&#160; Candidates from the Elephant and Solutions parties would not be allowed in this race.</p> 
<p>Is this approach fair?&#160; Yes.&#160; Consider that it is very rare for a candidate from an unpopular political party to win an important election.</p> 
<p>A notable exception occurred when wrestler Jesse Ventura was elected Governor of Minnesota.&#160; But consider why he won.&#160; Many of the people who voted for him were expressing their frustration with the candidates from the Republican and Democratic parties.&#160; If those voters could have voted in ways that motivated the Republican and Democratic parties to offer more appealing candidates, Ventura would have received many fewer votes.&#160; Another consideration is that this election used plurality voting, and Ventura won without receiving a majority of votes.&#160; (In this election the split between Republicans and Democrats gave him an added advantage.)</p> 
<p><b>If voters are allowed to rank the popularity of political parties, there is no need to offer candidates from unpopular political parties &#8212; in important elections</b>.&#160; Those candidates clutter up the ballot unnecessarily.</p> 
<p>This limit would apply to important elections such as for Governors, Congressmen, and Presidents.&#160; Less important elections, such as electing a city's Mayor, may not need to use this limit.&#160; Consider that less-important elections attract fewer candidates, and political-party orientations are much less significant.</p> 
<h1>Allowing A Second Candidate For Each Of The Two Top Parties</h1> 
<p>Here is another surprise.&#160; <b>In each general election the first-ranked and second-ranked parties will be allowed to have two candidates each</b>.&#160; Based on current conditions this means there would be two Republican candidates and two Democratic candidates in each general-election race.&#160; <b>The remaining political parties that are allowed to have candidates will be allowed only one candidate in each general-election race</b>.</p> 
<p>Shown below is a sample ballot that illustrates this concept for the sample gubernatorial election.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_310_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 310" width="580" height="376"/></p> 
<p>Why should the two top parties be allowed an extra candidate each?&#160; As previously explained (in Chapter 6), the candidate who is truly the most popular candidate among all the voters &#8212; of all parties &#8212; is not necessarily the most popular candidate among the voters in that candidate's own party.&#160; Another way of stating this unfairness is that the practice of only allowing Republicans to vote in Republican primaries can easily eliminate a Republican candidate who, among both Republican and Democratic voters, is the most popular candidate.&#160; Similarly, Democratic voters can easily eliminate a Democratic candidate who the Republican voters prefer over the Democratic candidate who wins the Democratic primary.</p> 
<p>Allowing two candidates from each of the two main political parties provides what might be called a <i><b>second chance</b></i> to nominate someone who is widely appreciated by all the voters &#8212; from both political parties.&#160; In this sense <b>each of the two main parties can offer not only the candidate who is most popular among the voters registered in that party, but also can offer another candidate who may be more acceptable to the voters registered in the opposing party</b>.&#160; Another way of stating this is to say that <b>the second candidate from each top party helps to accommodate cross-party preferences</b>.</p> 
<p>Allowing two candidates from each of the two top parties will reduce the currently excessive influence of campaign contributions.&#160; How?&#160; There will be twice as many candidates that contributors must support in order to guarantee access to whoever wins.&#160; In addition, when a heavily funded candidate competes against a voter-preferred candidate from the same party, the heavily funded candidate would more often lose to the voter-preferred candidate.</p> 
<p>Now you can better appreciate why the current practice of the Republican and Democratic parties each offering just one candidate leads to a general election in which a majority of voters dislike both choices.&#160; This consequence has become especially clear in recent Presidential elections.</p> 
<h1>Why Favor Two Main Parties?</h1> 
<p>Of course rewarding the two top political parties with an extra candidate on the ballot increases the chances of these two parties winning more elections.&#160; This is an intentional effect.&#160; It provides voters with more choices from the two parties they most prefer.</p> 
<p>If this approach seems to be an unfair advantage, consider that when voters don't like any of the four candidates from the two top parties, there are at least two more candidates to choose from.&#160; If one of the two top parties repeatedly offers unappreciated candidates, the ranking of that party will drop and another party will take its place.&#160; As a result, the two top parties, which currently are the Republican and Democratic parties, are motivated to offer candidates whose agendas voters appreciate.</p> 
<p>As previously explained (in Chapter 8), there are advantages to having just two main political parties.&#160; As a reminder, having two dominant parties avoids the need to form coalitions, which require backroom compromises that are often contrary to what a majority of voters want.&#160; Also recall that the voting methods currently used in Congress and state legislatures involve vote trading and logrolling, and someday these voting methods will be replaced by more advanced voting methods that can accommodate more than two main political parties.&#160; In the meantime, <b>until advanced voting methods are finally adopted for use in Congress and state legislatures, favoring two main political parties ensures that voters, rather than money-influenced political-party leaders, control the agendas of Congress and state legislatures</b>.</p> 
<p>Finally, consider that <b>when voters are finally allowed to directly express their preference for political parties, third-party candidates will lose their appeal as a choice for the many voters who currently want to express, on their ballot, a dislike of both the Republican and Democratic parties</b>.</p> 
<h1>Disallowing Parties Based On Religion, Gender, Or Race</h1> 
<p>There is another advantage to <b>having two main political parties</b>.&#160; It <b>forces cooperation between people with very different political agendas</b>.</p> 
<p>To appreciate this advantage, consider what would happen if there were no limits on who can form a political party.&#160; Large political parties would tend to split into smaller parties based on race, religion, and gender.&#160; For example, consider political parties with names such as the Women's party, the African-American party, the Hispanic party, the Anglo-Saxon party, the Jewish party, the Catholic party, and the Conservative Christian party.&#160; The obvious result of a population breaking down into such polarized parties would be increased conflicts, somewhat like the conflict in Northern Ireland between Catholics and Protestants.</p> 

<p>The existing two-party limit forces cooperation between people with significant differences.&#160; For example, the European-based conflict between Catholics and Protestants has very little influence in U.S. politics because Catholics and Protestants must cooperate politically to achieve more important political agendas.&#160; As a clearer example of sometimes-forced cooperation, people from different races routinely register to vote in the same political party and vote in favor of the same candidates.</p> 
<p>This increased cooperation has contributed significantly to the economic prosperity of the United States.&#160; Compared to other countries, employees in a U.S. corporation demonstrate a high level of cooperation in spite of racial, gender, and religious differences.&#160; In other countries it is common for consumers to buy from businesses owned by people with the same political orientation, whereas in the United States it is uncommon to characterize a business as Republican or Democratic.</p> 
<p>How can religious, gender, and racial differences be avoided as the basis for political parties?&#160; <b>The name of a political party whose agenda is based on religion, gender, or race must not be allowed to appear on any ballot.&#160; And any candidate from such a political party would not be listed on any ballot</b>.</p> 
<p>Notice that the political parties themselves would not be banned, because that would deny their rights to freedom of speech.&#160; Instead, the ban only affects what appears on ballots for government offices.&#160; Of course this limitation effectively, yet fairly, limits the power of any such group.</p> 
<p>Suppose a political party chooses a neutral name that does not reveal any religious, gender, or racial orientation, yet it has such an orientation.&#160; How can such a political party be recognized?&#160; By the candidates the party offers and promotes.&#160; For example, suppose there is a political party named the Alliance party.&#160; If this party predominantly promotes candidates who are Latino and only occasionally promotes non-Latino candidates, the name of the political party and any candidates from that party would be banned from the ballot.&#160; As a less obvious example, if a political party named the Tree party predominantly promoted male candidates and only occasionally promoted female candidates, that party and its candidates would be banned from appearing on ballots.</p> 
<p>Should other political differences &#8212; such as rich versus poor or business-owner versus employee &#8212; also be banned as the basis for political parties?&#160; No.&#160; Racial and gender differences are not changeable.&#160; In contrast, wealth and business ownership can change easily enough that someone can change back and forth between these characteristics.&#160; Religion is so rarely changed that it deserves to be regarded as unchangeable for political purposes.</p> 
<p>The limitation on political-party orientations would force political parties to attract candidates and voters from different racial, religious, and gender categories.&#160; Such cooperation forms the basis of democratic government.&#160; After all, cooperation means that conflicts are resolved peacefully and without threatened violence or economic coercion.&#160; In contrast, <b>when a democratic government fails to resolve conflicts without violence or threats of violence against large numbers of its own citizens, the power of that government is based on unfair voting methods</b>.</p> 
<h1>Number Seven, Number Seven</h1> 
<p>How many political parties would be allowed to enter their candidates in a general election?&#160; The number would be different for different races in the same general election.&#160; The number would primarily depend on the number of voters who are eligible to vote in that race.&#160; <b>In a race that involves fewer voters</b>, such as a race for the Mayor of a large city, <b>the race might be limited to six political parties.&#160; In a race that involves the largest number of voters</b>, such as a race for a U.S. Senate seat or a U.S. Presidential race, <b>the race might be limited to four political parties</b>.</p> 
<p>What happens <b>if one of the two top parties offers just one candidate instead of two</b>?&#160; <b>The highest-ranked among the political parties that otherwise are not allowed to offer even one candidate would be allowed to have one candidate in the race</b>.&#160; If the other top party also offers just one candidate, the next-ranked party would be allowed to have one candidate.&#160; This approach stops the two top parties from trying to monopolize the results by offering just a single choice each.</p> 
<p>Widespread research has shown that people have difficulty remembering more than about seven items at a time.&#160; For this reason <b>it is best to limit the total number of candidates in a single-position race to no more than seven candidates.&#160; When the number of voters is large, a smaller limit, such as four, five, or six candidates, may be more appropriate</b>.</p> 
<p>The limit on the total number of candidates in a race affects how many political parties are allowed to offer a candidate.&#160; For example, if both top parties offer just one candidate each, a seven-candidate limit would accommodate one candidate each from seven different parties.&#160; In contrast, if both top parties offer two candidates each, a seven-candidate limit would accommodate five parties, three of which would be allowed just one candidate each.</p> 
<p>If seven candidates in each race seems like more than most people can keep track of, consider that many voters will only express a preference among the four candidates from the two most representative parties.&#160; The preference levels for the other three candidates would be unmarked by many voters.&#160; This situation is similar to what happens now because most voters basically ignore candidates from third parties.&#160; Remember that VoteFair ranking easily accommodates voters who indicate an equal preference among disliked candidates.</p> 
<h1>Smooth Transitions</h1> 
<p>Occasionally the ranking of one of the two top parties may drop and the former third-ranked party will rise to take its place.&#160; But such changes won't come as a surprise.&#160; Here are a few reasons why the change will happen somewhat smoothly.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If a party declines in its ranking, the party-ranking results reveal this decline two years in advance.&#160; This advance notice gives the political party time to adjust its agendas and choose different kinds of candidates in hopes of restoring its former popularity.</li> 
<li>A voter can express displeasure with a high-ranked party by ranking that party at a lower level, and yet still give first-choice preference to the candidates in that party.&#160; Currently the only way to express displeasure with a party is to vote for candidates in other parties.&#160; This current approach introduces the risk of those candidates winning, even though that was not the intent of the vote.</li> 
<li>If one of the two top parties dramatically lost popularity, it would first lose only its opportunity to offer two candidates in some races in some cities and states.&#160; Only if it lost its remaining popularity would it stop being allowed to offer even one candidate in important races.</li> 
<li>If a new party grows in popularity, it would first achieve enough popularity to be allowed to have one candidate in each race, but only in some states.&#160; Later, if it continues to grow in popularity it could begin winning more seats in Congress.&#160; If that doesn't motivate one or both of the two top parties to adopt at least some of the new party's agenda, then the party that loses its position in the top two deserves the loss.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>A top-ranked political party is unlikely to fall from popularity unless the top party leaders make foolish decisions and stray from the agendas of its voters.&#160; In other words, <b>increases in party ranking will be earned, and declines will be deserved</b>.&#160; This fairness contrasts with the current approach in which party dominance is based on past performance rather than current representativeness.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; When you are talking to someone who wants to know how political parties can be motivated to respond to strong voter preferences that are currently ignored, consider asking their opinion about allowing voters to rank political parties and using the results to determine how many candidates each party can have in a general-election race.</p> 
<p>Point out that perhaps voters should be allowed to express their preferences for political parties.&#160; But instead of just indicating a preference for a single political party, which is the approach used in many European countries, point out that each voter can indicate his or her order of preference for all the political parties, and VoteFair party ranking can be used to identify the ranking of the parties.&#160; The results would reveal which parties are so unpopular they don't deserve to clutter up the ballot with their candidates.</p>

<p>Electing city Mayors and state Governors is relatively straightforward because these positions involve just one open position, and because city and state boundaries rarely change.&#160; In this chapter let's explore how the elections for these positions can be done using the party-ranking method described in the previous chapter.&#160; Let's also explore how VoteFair ranking can accommodate the write-in candidates who sometimes run in these elections.</p> 
<h1>Big Enough For Parties</h1> 
<p>Elections for city Mayors, state Governors, State Treasurers, and Secretaries of State are similar because they share these characteristics.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>The candidates in these elections are associated with political parties.&#160; In contrast, note that some elected officials &#8212; such as judges, county Sheriffs, and school-board members &#8212; are required to be non-partisan.</li> 
<li>Just one person is elected to a single position.&#160; Specifically, a city has just one Mayor and a state has just one Governor.</li> 
<li>These elections involve city and state boundaries, which are boundaries that rarely change.&#160; The lack of boundary-related issues means there are seldom controversies about which citizens should be allowed to vote in each of these elections.</li> 
<li>All the voters follow the same election laws.&#160; Notice that this characteristic does not apply to Presidential elections.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>How can these elections be done in a way that is fair?&#160; Of course the elections would involve these already-described elements.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Voters use ranked ballots to express their preferences for the candidates.</li> 
<li>The most popular candidate is identified using VoteFair popularity ranking.</li> 
<li>Two years in advance, in a general election, voters use ranked ballots to express their preferences for the political parties that are registered in that state.</li> 
<li>The ranking of each political party is determined using VoteFair party ranking.&#160; There are separate rankings for city and state races.</li> 
<li>In the general election, the first-ranked and second-ranked parties are allowed to have two candidates each.&#160; Remember that the two highest-ranked parties in a city's elections are not necessarily the same as the two highest-ranked parties in the state's elections.</li> 
<li>The third-ranked and fourth-ranked parties, and perhaps the fifth-ranked and sixth-ranked parties, are allowed to have one candidate each in the general election.</li> 
<li>Any lower-ranked parties are not allowed to clutter up the ballot with their candidates.&#160; Keep in mind that a political party might rank high enough in a city to have a candidate for city Mayor, but not rank high enough in the state to have a candidate for state Governor.</li> 
</ul> 
<h1>Voter's Perspective</h1> 
<p>From the perspective of the voters, the full election process for electing a Mayor or Governor consists of these three steps.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>At the general election two years in advance, voters indicate their preferences for the political parties registered in the state.</li> 
<li>At the primary election a few months before the candidate general election, voters indicate their preferences for the candidates competing for each party's nomination.&#160; In this primary election only the voters who are registered with a political party are allowed to express their preference for the candidates competing within their party.</li> 
<li>In the general election, all the voters indicate their order of preference for the qualified candidates.&#160; These candidates are the two most-popular candidates each from the first-ranked and second-ranked parties, and the most popular candidate from each of the next-highest-ranked parties.&#160; (The city-based party ranking would apply to the Mayor's race, and the state-based party ranking would apply to the Governor's race.)</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Based on the preferences expressed in the general election, VoteFair popularity ranking identifies the most popular candidate in each race, and that candidate is elected.</p> 
<h1>Small Enough For Write-In Candidates</h1> 
<p>Should write-in candidates be allowed in governmental elections?&#160; It depends on how many voters are involved.&#160; <b>Presidential elections and Congressional elections involve so many voters that write-in candidates have virtually no chance of winning, so write-in candidates don't deserve to be accommodated in these elections</b>.</p> 
<p>In contrast, elections for city Mayors, county Sheriffs, and Governors of small states involve far fewer voters.&#160; In these elections a write-in candidate has a chance of winning, so it is reasonable to accommodate write-in candidates.</p> 
<p>Before considering how to accommodate write-in candidates, it is worth noting that <b>the use of VoteFair ranking greatly decreases the chances of a write-in candidate winning an election</b>.&#160; Why?&#160; Currently when a write-in candidate wins an election it is often because the use of plurality voting allows the write-in candidate to win without the support of a majority of voters.&#160; In addition, the appeal of write-in candidates as alternatives to money-backed Republican and Democratic candidates will fade as Republican and Democratic candidates become more representative of what voters want.</p> 
<p>Can ranked ballots accommodate write-in candidates?&#160; Yes.&#160; For the races in which write-in candidates are allowed, a space on the ballot allows a voter to write the name of a write-in candidate.&#160; The level of preference for that candidate is indicated in the usual way.&#160; The ballot below shows this approach.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_320_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 320" width="580" height="380"/></p> 
<p>This ballot is marked to indicate that the write-in candidate named Atwood is this voter's first choice.&#160; How is it possible to know the popularity of this candidate among the voters who don't write this name on their ballot?</p> 
<p><b>On any ballot on which the write-in candidate's name does not appear, the write-in candidate is ranked below the preference level of all the listed candidates</b>.&#160; Basically this interpretation amounts to pretending there is yet another column at the right side, and that the oval in this additional column is marked if a candidate's name does not appear on the ballot.</p> 
<p>If some voters write in the name of one candidate and other voters write in the name of a different write-in candidate, what can be done?&#160; The same interpretation still works, except that all the names that do not appear on a ballot would be regarded as tied at the preference level below all the listed candidates.</p> 
<p>By using these interpretations <b>VoteFair ranking easily accommodates write-in candidates</b>.&#160; The extra candidates and extra preference levels do not cause any complication.</p> 
<h1>What's Up Sheriff?</h1> 
<p>An election for a county Sheriff is different from an election for Mayor because a Sheriff is supposed to be non-partisan.&#160; As a result, an election for Sheriff does not involve a primary election, and political-party limits do not apply.&#160; These differences simplify elections for Sheriffs.</p> 
<p><b>An election for Sheriff would just involve ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking, without the extra political-party considerations that are needed for electing Mayors and Governors</b>.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; If you live in a city or state where many voters are frustrated by election results, consider telling other frustrated voters that your Mayor and Governor could be elected in a way that is fairer than the current approach.</p> 
<p>If you are inclined to do so, you might want to write a letter to the editor of a local newspaper recommending that voting methods be improved.&#160; If you do so, be sure to emphasize that voters should be allowed to indicate not only their first choice, but also their second choice, third choice, and so on.&#160; Also point out that VoteFair ranking is the only method that, in all situations, correctly identifies the most popular candidate.</p> 
<p>If there is interest in adopting VoteFair ranking and ranked ballots for electing a Mayor or Governor, point out that the VoteFair.org website contains the wording for a law that implements this method.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 18:&#160; Top Run:&#160; Fixing The Broken Presidential Race</h1> 
<p>VoteFair ranking and ranked ballots are obviously needed for getting fair results in Presidential elections.&#160; Less obviously, electoral votes should still be used, but in a way that does not involve the unfair aspects of the Electoral College.&#160; In this chapter let's explore how electoral votes can be assigned to Presidential candidates in a way that produces a majority-preferred outcome, even when there are more than two Presidential candidates.&#160; When this approach is eventually adopted, U.S. Presidential elections will finally produce truly fair results.</p> 
<h1>Electoral Without The College</h1> 
<p>As previously explained (in Chapter 10), the use of electoral votes in Presidential elections provides a fair way to accommodate state-based differences in Presidential elections.&#160; As a reminder, electoral votes compensate for state-based differences such as these.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Bad weather on election day can reduce voter turnout in some states.</li> 
<li>Different states use different ballot designs and different voting technologies.</li> 
<li>Each state has different laws regarding how long a U.S. citizen must reside in the state before being allowed to vote in that state.</li> 
<li>Some states make voter registration and getting absentee ballots easier than others.</li> 
<li>Everyone in the state of Oregon votes by mail instead of going to polling places.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Electoral votes compensate for citizens in each state who, for whatever reason, don't vote in the Presidential election.&#160; How can we know the political preferences of the citizens who don't vote?&#160; We assume that the voters in each state who do vote are reasonably representative of all the citizens in the state.</p> 
<h1>Proportional Electoral Votes</h1> 
<p>The balancing among states is done through the magic of the calculations previously described in Chapter 10.&#160; As a reminder, these calculations split up electoral votes to match the proportion of voters who have each preference.</p> 
<p>Recall (from Chapter 10) that <b>if electoral votes are split in a way that exactly matches the actual votes (by using decimal numbers), each individual voter can see the effect of their vote on the total number of electoral votes given to each Presidential candidate</b>.&#160; Also recall that <b>simply splitting electoral votes proportionally does not, by itself, produce an appropriate alternative to the Electoral College</b>.&#160; Why?&#160; Because it is easy for none of the Presidential candidates to get a majority of electoral votes.&#160; For example, in the 2000 Presidential election Ralph Nader and other third-party candidates received about four percent of the votes, so neither George W.&#160; Bush nor Al Gore would have received a majority of proportionally assigned electoral votes.</p> 
<p><b>According to the Constitution the appropriate way to resolve the lack of an electoral-vote majority is to turn the decision over to the U.S. House of Representatives</b> (with each state getting one vote).&#160; Of course <b>a much fairer approach would be to ensure a majority outcome</b> &#8212; regardless of how many candidates are in the race &#8212; <b>by using ranked ballots to collect all the preferences of all the voters, and then using VoteFair ranking to identify which Presidential candidate is preferred by a majority of voters</b>.&#160; Before seeing how VoteFair ranking can accommodate electoral votes, let's take a moment to consider the issue of whether each state should receive one or two extra electoral votes.</p> 
<h1>Slight Adjustment</h1> 
<p>As previously explained (in Chapter 10), the current practice of giving each state two extra electoral votes &#8212; beyond the electoral votes based on the state's population &#8212; gives an excessive amount of influence to voters in less-populated states such as New Hampshire and Rhode Island.&#160; A fairer approach is to give each state just one extra electoral vote.&#160; This extra electoral vote would continue to motivate Presidential candidates to not neglect less-populated states, but the extra influence would be reduced to a level that is not excessive.</p> 
<h1>VoteFair Electoral Steps</h1> 
<p>How can VoteFair ranking accommodate the use of electoral votes?&#160; As previously explained (in Chapter 12), VoteFair ranking normally involves two steps: creating a tally table that summarizes voter preferences, and using these tally numbers to determine the overall popularity sequence.&#160; The use of electoral votes introduces two extra steps.&#160; Here are the four steps required for Presidential elections.</p> 
<ol> 
<li><b>Each state creates a tally table that summarizes the preferences of the voters in that state.</b></li> 
<li><b>The numbers in each state's tally table</b> (which count the number of voters who have each type of preference) <b>are converted into electoral votes &#8212; without ignoring the digits to the right of the decimal point</b>.</li> 
<li><b>The numbers in the 50 electoral-vote tally tables are combined &#8212; using addition &#8212; to create a nationwide electoral-vote tally table</b>.</li> 
<li><b>The second step of VoteFair ranking uses the nationwide electoral-vote tally table to identify the popularity of each Presidential candidate</b>. Obviously the most popular candidate would be elected President.</li> 
</ol> 
<h1>Tallying For Each State</h1> 
<p>The best way to understand these steps is to follow an example.&#160; Let's use numbers from the 2000 Presidential election.&#160; And let's reduce the preferences to a three-way race between the three most popular Presidential candidates: George W.&#160; Bush, Al Gore, and Ralph Nader.</p> 
<p>The voters in the 2000 Presidential election were not allowed to indicate secondary preferences, so we need to make some guesses about those secondary preferences.&#160; Let's use the assumptions explained in Chapter 10 and the scenario in which all the people who voted for Nader prefer Gore as their second choice.</p> 
<p>Based on these assumptions, here is the tally table that summarizes the preferences of the 2,025,480 Maryland voters who expressed a preference in the 2000 Presidential race.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_326_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 326" width="580" height="192"/></p> 
<p>The numbers in this table summarize the presumed preferences of the Maryland voters regarding the three-way race between Bush, Gore, and Nader.&#160; These are the numbers that need to be converted into electoral votes so they can be combined with the preference information from other states.</p> 
<h1>Electoral Conversion</h1> 
<p>How many electoral votes does Maryland get?&#160; It gets nine electoral votes if we use the fairer approach of each state getting just one extra electoral vote beyond the electoral votes based on population numbers.</p> 
<p>The numbers in a state's tally table are converted into electoral votes one at a time.&#160; Let's convert the upper-left number in the tally table (818,045), which indicates the number of voters who prefer Bush over Gore.&#160; It can be converted into electoral votes using a calculator.&#160; Of course in a real election a computer would do the calculations, so if you hate mathematics, just skip over the remainder of this paragraph and let the computer do it.&#160; If you want to understand the calculation, here are the steps.&#160; To start the conversion, enter into the calculator the tally number, which is 818,045.&#160; Multiply that number by the number of the state's electoral votes, which is 9 in this case.&#160; Then divide the result by the total number of votes cast in Maryland for Presidential candidates, which is 2,025,480.&#160; The result is 3.63489395 (about three and a half).&#160; This is the number of electoral votes that represent the amount of support Maryland voters have for Bush over Gore.</p> 
<p>These numbers are not rounded because the full number accounts for every single voter in Maryland.&#160; Specifically, if one of the voters who voted for Nader is assumed to prefer Bush instead of Gore, then this number would change to 3.63489839 and the difference (which is 0.00000444) represents that one voter.&#160; As previously explained, keeping track of all the digits enables every voter to see their influence in the final result.&#160; It also protects against getting the wrong result if there is almost a tie.</p> 
<p>After doing similar calculations for each number in the tally table, we arrive at the numbers in this table, which is the rounded-off version of Maryland's electoral-vote tally table.&#160; If decimal numbers make you uncomfortable, just ignore the digits to the right of the decimal point.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_327_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 327" width="580" height="192"/></p> 
<p>Through the magic of converting raw votes into these electoral votes, these numbers represent the preferences of all the citizens of Maryland, not just the citizens who voted.&#160; This use of electoral votes ensures that the Maryland citizens who didn't vote, perhaps because of bad weather and inconveniently located polling places, are not out-voted by voters in other states where voting is easier.</p> 
<h1>Going Nationwide</h1> 
<p>How are the electoral-vote tally tables from the 50 states combined to create the nationwide tally table?&#160; <b>Equivalent numbers in the tally tables are simply added together</b>.&#160; For example, the electoral-vote number in one state's tally table that indicates the support for Bush over Gore is added to the electoral-vote number in another state's tally table that also indicates the support for Bush over Gore.&#160; In other words, all the upper-left numbers in all 50 tally tables are added together to produce the upper-left number in the nationwide tally table.</p> 
<p>Here is what the nationwide tally table looks like for the three-way race between George W.&#160; Bush, Al Gore, and Ralph Nader.&#160; It represents the preferences of all the citizens in all the states &#8212; assuming that the people who didn't vote are reasonably well represented by the people in the same state who did vote.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_328_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 328" width="580" height="192"/></p> 
<p><b>This approach of keeping track of more than just one number for each candidate enables Presidential elections to accommodate additional candidates beyond one Republican candidate and one Democratic candidate</b>.&#160; In other words, when a Presidential election involves a third Presidential candidate who is widely popular &#8212; such as Ralph Nader &#8212; these numbers reveal which candidate is preferred by a majority of voters.</p> 
<p><b>When this method is used, one of the candidates always receives a majority of electoral votes</b>.&#160; As a result, there is never any need to have another group of people &#8212; such as the U.S. House of Representatives &#8212; involved in resolving the lack of a majority.</p> 
<p>In theory, it is possible for the outcome to be a tie.&#160; However, an exact tie would virtually never occur in a Presidential election because there are so many votes.&#160; If an exact tie somehow did occur, it could easily be eliminated simply by recounting the votes.&#160; Recall that in the 2000 Presidential election the counting of votes in Florida produced different results each time counting was done.</p> 
<h1>Should Bush Or Gore Have Won?</h1> 
<p>In a Presidential election, <b>VoteFair popularity ranking easily transforms the numbers in the nationwide electoral-vote tally table into an overall popularity ranking</b>.&#160; Of course the Presidential candidate who is ranked as the most popular would be elected as the next President.</p> 
<p>In the nationwide electoral-vote tally table shown in the previous section, the outcome is clear even without doing the second step of VoteFair ranking.&#160; Look at the numbers in the upper-left and upper-right corners.&#160; These numbers, rounded off, indicate that the support for George W.&#160; Bush over Al Gore equals 236 electoral votes and the support for Gore over Bush equals 250 electoral votes.&#160; There is more support for Gore over Bush, so <b>these results indicate that Al Gore was more popular than George W. Bush</b>.</p> 
<p>Very importantly <b>Al Gore was preferred by a majority of voters</b>.&#160; Specifically, the support for Gore over Bush equals 51.3 percent &#8212; slightly more than half &#8212; of the electoral votes.&#160; This percentage number takes into account the single extra electoral vote (0.99) in the middle column that represents the voters who presumably had an equal preference for Bush and Gore.&#160; If we ignore this extra equal-preference electoral vote, the support for Gore over Bush increases slightly to 51.4 percent.</p> 
<p>These numbers assume that all the people who voted for Nader preferred Gore over Bush.&#160; Suppose we instead assume that half of these voters preferred Gore and the other half preferred Bush.&#160; In that case, Gore would barely win, by less than one electoral vote.&#160; Specifically, the support for Gore over Bush would equal 243.35 electoral votes, and the support for Bush over Gore would equal 242.65 electoral votes.&#160; Now you can appreciate why in a close race such as this, decimal numbers &#8212; instead of whole numbers &#8212; are needed.</p> 
<p>The assumption of people who voted for Ralph Nader being equally split between preferring Bush and preferring Gore is very unlikely.&#160; There is widespread recognition that at least a majority of these voters preferred Gore over Bush.&#160; Therefore, the assumption made earlier is reasonable and the outcome of Gore being more popular than Bush remains unchanged.</p> 
<p>Does this mean Al Gore deserved to win the Presidency?&#160; Yes and no.&#160; <b>Based on the votes that were cast, yes, Al Gore deserved to win because he was preferred over George W.&#160; Bush by more voters</b>.</p> 
<p>If the method described here had been used in the 2000 Presidential election, would Al Gore have won?&#160; We don't know, and we can't know for sure.&#160; Why?&#160; Because many voters chose not to vote because they knew their vote wouldn't make any difference in terms of which candidate received their state's electoral votes.&#160; In other words, the all-or-nothing assignment of each state's electoral votes caused voter turnout to change.&#160; <b>If the VoteFair method described here had been used in the 2000 Presidential election, each vote in every state would have made a difference in the nationwide electoral-vote tally table, and this change would have motivated many more voters to vote</b>.&#160; Although we could make some estimates of voter preferences based on party registration numbers, we can never know what the actual outcome would have been.&#160; Plus, it distracts us from a more important point.</p> 
<p>Focusing lots of attention on the numbers &#8212; and the butterfly ballots, hanging chads, and court decisions &#8212; involved in the close race between George W.&#160; Bush and Al Gore has distracted most people from recognizing a very important point.&#160; <b>The reason the race between George W.&#160; Bush and Al Gore was so close was that most voters didn't want either one of these candidates to become President!</b>&#160; In other words, if one of these two candidates had been both charismatic and supportive of what a majority of voters want, that candidate would have easily won a majority of votes from the Electoral College.</p> 
<p>Another way to express the unpopularity of these two Presidential choices is that both Bush and Gore were widely recognized as excessively influenced by campaign contributions.&#160; As emphasized in the first two chapters of this book, a majority of voters do not support the political agendas that are preferred by the biggest campaign contributors.&#160; This accounts for why both Presidential choices were unpopular.</p> 
<h1>What About The 2004 Presidential Election?</h1> 
<p>Suppose the calculation method explained for the 2000 Presidential election is applied to the numbers in the 2004 Presidential election.&#160; A popular third-party candidate was not involved in the 2004 election, so there should be no surprise about the outcome.&#160; George W.&#160; Bush would have won.&#160; The numbers based on these fairer calculations are that George W.&#160; Bush would have received 250.40 (about 250) electoral votes and John Kerry would have received 236.60 (about 237) electoral votes.&#160; If we translate these numbers into percentages, we get 51.42 percent for Bush, and 48.58 percent for Kerry.</p> 
<p>Now let's compare these numbers to the actual electoral votes.&#160; Bush actually received 286 electoral votes and Kerry actually received 252 electoral votes.&#160; (Remember that the totals don't match because the fairer calculation method uses one less electoral vote per state.)&#160; If we translate these numbers into percentages we get 53 percent for Bush and 47 percent for Kerry.</p> 
<p>What's important to understand is that the actual results imply there is a six percent difference between the candidates, whereas the fairer proportional electoral-vote method reveals there is only a three percent difference in popularity.&#160; In other words <b>the 2004 Presidential race was much closer than the actual results suggested</b>. As you can better appreciate now, the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections were both very close races.</p> 
<h1>Imposing Fairness In Primary Elections</h1> 
<p>What does the closeness of the 2000 and 2004 Presidential elections tell us?&#160; That neither political party offered a wise and charismatic leader as the winner of their primary election.&#160; This is an example of an important concept explained in Part Two.&#160; The biggest unfairnesses occur in primary elections, not general elections.&#160; The 2000 and 2004 Presidential primary elections &#8212; of both parties &#8212; produced candidates who were heavily influenced by campaign contributions.</p> 
<p>Should Congress write laws that impose fairness in primary elections?&#160; No, that isn't necessary.&#160; <b>When fair election methods are finally adopted for use in general elections, political parties will be motivated to dramatically improve the fairness of primary elections</b>.&#160; Why?&#160; Because voters will abandon a political party that persists in using unfair methods in their primary elections.</p> 
<h1>Dueling Duos</h1> 
<p>As previously explained (in Chapter 16), an important aspect of fair elections is to allow voters to express their order of preference for political parties, and then use these preferences to eliminate candidates from unpopular parties and allow an extra candidate from each of the two top parties.&#160; An overall limit of six Presidential candidates is fair.</p> 
<p>With this limitation in mind, here is a ballot that shows what a general-election ballot for the Presidential race will look like.&#160; The candidate names and party names used in this example are historical.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_332_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 332" width="580" height="457"/></p> 
<p>Notice there are six choices from four parties.&#160; The two top parties are the Republican and Democratic parties, and they have two Presidential candidates each.&#160; The third-ranked and fourth-ranked parties are the Whig and Federalist parties, and they have one Presidential candidate each.&#160; Notice there is no provision for a write-in candidate because a write-in candidate has absolutely no chance of winning a Presidential election.</p> 
<h1>Who's Your Running Mate?</h1> 
<p>Allowing the two highest-ranked parties to have two Presidential candidates each introduces these interesting possibilities.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Each of the two Presidential candidates from the same political party could have the same Vice-Presidential running mate.</li> 
<li>Each of the two Presidential candidates from the same political party would be allowed to have as their Vice Presidential running mate the other Presidential candidate from the same party.&#160; This approach would be used when either Presidential candidate is willing to become Vice President if the other candidate is elected President.</li> 
<li>The Constitution requires that a President and Vice President must not be residents of the same state.&#160; If this restriction is maintained, some pairs of Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates might not be allowed.</li> 
</ul> 
<h1>Advantages That Await</h1> 
<p>What are the advantages of the Presidential election method described in this chapter?</p> 
<ul> 
<li>It provides a fair result even when there are more than two popular Presidential candidates.</li> 
<li>One of the Presidential candidates gets a majority of electoral votes, even if there are six popular choices on the ballot.</li> 
<li>It prevents the House of Representatives from getting involved in choosing the next President due to the lack of a majority.</li> 
<li>It stops the unfairness of assigning all the electoral votes from a state to a single candidate.</li> 
<li>It eliminates the use of the intermediate voters who are collectively known as the Electoral College.</li> 
<li>Every vote in every state makes a difference in the final numbers, so there are no wasted votes.</li> 
<li>It eliminates the distraction of Presidential candidates who have no chance of winning.</li> 
<li>It allows a voter to indicate his or her real preferences.&#160; This means that if a voter chooses to rank in first place a candidate who is not popular with the other voters, the voter's other preferences still have full influence on the outcome.</li> 
<li>It uses VoteFair popularity ranking to correctly identify which Presidential candidate is truly the most popular.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>With these changes voters will someday see on the ballot the names of Presidential candidates whose agendas are more closely aligned with what most voters really want.</p> 
<h1>Amending The Constitution</h1> 
<p>Implementing the changes described in this chapter will require an amendment to the Constitution.&#160; Passing a constitutional amendment requires the approval of the legislatures in at least 38 states, so these changes are unlikely to be implemented in the near future.</p> 
<p>Although this delay might seem frustrating, the delay is desirable.&#160; If it were too easy to amend the Constitution, many voters and well-meaning politicians would be tempted to implement unfair methods, such as direct voting or instant-runoff voting.</p> 
<p>As previously explained (in Chapter 3), the United States is nearly the only nation that has been relatively successful in directly electing a single executive leader.&#160; In almost every other democratic nation the executive leader is chosen with the involvement of intermediary people.&#160; The other important exception is France, which uses unfair runoff voting.</p> 
<p>Our desire, as voters, to eliminate the involvement of the Electoral College and the U.S. House of Representatives in the Presidential election process must not lead us to adopt an election method that has not yet withstood the test of time.&#160; Before the Presidential election method described in this chapter is implemented, its components &#8212; especially ranked ballots, expressing political-party preferences, and VoteFair ranking &#8212; must demonstrate successful results in less-important elections.&#160; In other words, fairer voting methods must be used to elect Mayors, state legislators, Governors, and Congressmen before the methods are combined with proportional electoral votes to fairly elect a U.S. President.</p> 
<p>The website at <b>VoteFair.org</b> contains a proposed constitutional amendment that implements the Presidential election method described in this chapter.&#160; <b>When enough voters have become comfortable with ranked ballots, VoteFair ranking, and the ranking of political parties, the wording to implement this fair way to elect U.S. Presidents is ready</b>.</p> 
<p>Eventually the outdated Electoral College &#8212; but not the wisely designed electoral votes &#8212; will finally, and deservedly, be laid to rest.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; When you talk to someone about how Presidential elections can be improved, stay focused on the most important issues.&#160; Avoid getting distracted by less important issues.&#160; Here are reminders of the important issues.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>If someone recommends a way to improve Presidential elections, ask them how a winner is chosen if none of the Presidential candidates receives a majority of votes.&#160; If they recommend using direct votes, point out that neither George W.&#160; Bush nor Al Gore received a majority of direct votes in the 2000 Presidential election, and ask them how that situation would be resolved.&#160; If plurality voting is recommended, point out that the splitting of votes can easily lead to unfair results.</li> 
<li>If someone recommends using instant-runoff voting, point out that this method only produces fair results when the contest is between two or three dominant candidates.&#160; Although this is what currently happens in Presidential elections, point out that the current Presidential election method is what created and maintains the existing two-party monopoly.&#160; If the two-party monopoly ends, voters will split up into numerous smaller political parties and then the unfairness of instant-runoff voting will finally become apparent.</li> 
<li>Emphasize that voters must be allowed to indicate not only their first choice, but also their second choice, third choice, and so on.&#160; Without this additional information there is no way to identify a majority winner without involving another group of people &#8212; such as members of Congress.</li> 
<li>When someone recommends eliminating the Electoral College, agree that the people who comprise the Electoral College do need to be eliminated, and ask how they recommend making this change.&#160; If they recommend eliminating the use of electoral votes, resist the temptation to argue about this issue, which is a minor issue compared to the bigger issues listed above.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>If you are impatient to improve the fairness of Presidential elections, use your impatience to promote the use of ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking in smaller elections where fewer people need to be convinced to try this approach.&#160; The voters involved in these elections will see, in a meaningful way, that this approach produces fairer results.&#160; That experience will motivate many of these people to recommend this approach for use in yet other elections.&#160; Ironically this promotional approach will more quickly lead to Presidential-election reforms.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 19:&#160; Balancing Act:&#160; Electing U.S. Senators In A Fair And Balanced Way</h1> 
<p>The election of U.S. Senators involves electing not just one winner, but two winners from each state.&#160; In this chapter let's explore how VoteFair representation ranking can be used to identify which candidate deserves to win the state's second Senate seat.&#160; The results are much fairer than the results produced by current methods, which involve manipulatable boundaries or permitting a slight majority of voters to choose both Senators.</p> 
<h1>Two At A Time</h1> 
<p>By now it should be obvious that U.S. Senators should be elected using ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking.&#160; It should also be obvious that the two highest-ranked political parties should be allowed to have at least one extra candidate, and that the most unpopular parties should not be allowed to have any Senatorial candidates.&#160; These conventions are the same as the ones for electing Mayors and Governors.</p> 
<p>The big surprise about electing U.S. Senators is that <b>the fairest results are achieved if both Senators from a state are elected at the same time, with all the candidates for both seats competing together in the same race</b>.</p> 
<p>Electing both Senators in the same race eliminates the unfairness of using a boundary to divide a state into two halves and letting the voters in each half elect one Senator.&#160; As previously explained (in Chapter 9), gerrymandering techniques can dramatically change the outcome of both elections just by changing the boundary location.</p> 
<p>There is another important advantage to this approach.&#160; <b>Having all the voters in a state elect both Senators in the same race allows the use of VoteFair representation ranking</b> (which is described in Chapter 15).&#160; Remember that <b>VoteFair representation ranking takes into account which candidate wins the first seat before determining which candidate deserves to win the second seat</b>.</p> 
<p>Let's use an example to clarify the fairness provided by VoteFair representation ranking.&#160; Suppose that a state has 60 Republican voters and 40 Democratic voters.&#160; If the two Senators are elected in two separate statewide (general) elections, both Senators will be Republicans because the Republican voters outvote the Democratic voters in both elections.&#160; This result is unfair because it leaves the 40 Democratic voters completely unrepresented.</p> 
<p>Suppose VoteFair popularity ranking &#8212; instead of representation ranking &#8212; is used.&#160; The most popular candidate and the second-most popular candidate both will be Republicans.&#160; Why?&#160; Because the same 60 Republican voters who are numerous enough to provide a majority for the most popular candidate are also numerous enough to provide a majority for the second-most popular candidate.</p> 
<p>As previously explained (in Chapter 15), VoteFair representation ranking reduces &#8212; in a proportional way &#8212; the influence of voters who are already well-represented by the winner of the first seat.&#160; This reduced influence gives the remaining voters an opportunity to elect a politician who better represents the remaining voters.&#160; In the case of 60 Republican voters and 40 Democratic voters, the second seat probably would be won by a Democratic candidate.&#160; With this arrangement the Republican Senator represents the 60 Republican voters, and the Democratic Senator represents the 40 Democratic voters.</p> 
<p>Some people might criticize the idea of electing both Senators in the same year by saying that continuity suffers if both Senators from a state are new in the same year.&#160; Such criticism overlooks these facts.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Senators commonly serve more than one or two decades.&#160; In fact most Senators are reelected until they retire from the Senate or become involved in a scandal.</li> 
<li>A new Senator already would be politically well-connected.&#160; This is virtually a prerequisite for having enough clout to get elected to the Senate.</li> 
<li>Employees who work as Congressional staff members are always available to incoming Senators because many of them recently worked for Congressmen who failed to get reelected.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>As you can see, continuity is a trivial issue compared to the issues of fairness in electing Senators.</p> 
<h1>Double The Winners, Double The Choices</h1> 
<p>In earlier chapters you learned that elections involving a single winner should accommodate two candidates from each of the two highest-ranked parties.&#160; <b>In the case of Senate elections where two seats are filled, the two highest-ranked political parties must be allowed to offer four candidates each</b>.</p> 
<p>To appreciate why, suppose the Republican party is allowed to offer just two candidates, and suppose almost all the voters prefer Republican candidates.&#160; This situation would lead to both Republican candidates winning both Senate seats.&#160; Although this outcome is fair in terms of the balance between Republicans and Democrats, the restriction does not give the voters in the general election any choice about which Republican candidates win the two seats.</p> 
<p>Shown below is what a voter might see on a general-election ballot for a state's two U.S. Senate positions.&#160; (Not all the ovals are shown.)</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_340_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 340" width="580" height="587"/></p> 
<p>In this ballot there are four candidates from each of the first-ranked and second-ranked parties (the Republican and Democratic parties), and just one candidate each from the third-ranked and fourth-ranked parties (the Green and Libertarian parties).&#160; Candidates from lower-ranked parties are not allowed to have candidates on the ballot, and that prevents the list from becoming excessively long.</p> 
<p>Notice that write-in candidates are not allowed.&#160; Why?&#160; Because a write-in candidate has no chance of winning a U.S. Senate seat.</p> 
<h1>Matching The Balance Of Voters</h1> 
<p>Limiting the Senatorial candidates to just the four highest-ranked parties provides another benefit.&#160; This approach motivates voters to split up into just two main parties.&#160; As previously explained (in Chapter 9), motivating voters to group together into just two main political parties forces voters to cooperate instead of splitting up into numerous smaller political parties.</p> 
<p>Remember that Senators use decision-making voting methods that do not work well with numerous political parties.&#160; In particular, if there are three or four large parties, the only way to get enough votes for a bill to pass is for several parties to join together to form a ruling coalition.&#160; The unfairness of this approach is that the parties in the coalition virtually always make concessions that are not desired by the voters who support the coalition parties.&#160; <b>As long as unfair voting methods are used in Congress, a much better approach is to allow the voters themselves to choose between two coalitions in the form of the Republican and Democratic parties.&#160; An ideal place to encourage the continued existence of two main political parties in the United States is in the Senate because each state elects two Senators</b>.</p> 
<p>The increased tendency for a state's Senators to be from different political parties would increase the likelihood &#8212; but not the inevitability &#8212; of the Senate being exactly balanced, with the number of Republican Senators being exactly equal to the number of Democratic Senators.&#160; As previously explained (in Chapter 9), an exact balance would not lead to a standoff.&#160; The Senate would have no difficulty passing laws that match the desires of most voters.&#160; The laws that would fail to pass are the ones that are favored by just one party.&#160; It is wasteful to pass barely favored laws because they are often overturned the next time the opposite party gains power.</p> 
<h1>Constitutional Change</h1> 
<p>Does this recommended voting method have any disadvantages?&#160; Yes, it's unconstitutional.&#160; Currently the Constitution does not allow the two Senators from the same state to be elected in the same year.&#160; When a constitutional amendment is finally added to fix the unfairness of Presidential elections, it will be easy to overcome this barrier.&#160; Of course that won't happen for a long time, so what can be done in the meantime?</p> 
<p><b>An alternate approach is to require the two Senators from the same state to be from different political parties</b>.&#160; Under current conditions this requirement would lead to most states having one Republican Senator and one Democratic Senator.&#160; Of course this approach is not ideal.&#160; Also, other laws or judicial rulings may prohibit this approach.&#160; Yet this approach would produce fairer results than the methods used now.</p> 
<p>Another alternative is to simply add ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking to existing election methods.&#160; Although some unfairnesses would continue, overall fairness would improve.&#160; Keep in mind that this approach should be abandoned when the Constitution is amended to allow both Senators from the same state to be elected at the same time.</p> 
<h1>Electing State Senators</h1> 
<p>Some states have a state senate as a part of the state legislature.&#160; Should state senators be elected in the same way as U.S. Senators?&#160; No, because a state senate does not involve the two-seat limit and unchangeable boundary constraints that are involved in electing U.S. Senators.&#160; State senators should be elected in basically the same way as state representatives, which is explained in the next chapter.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; If the topic of electing U.S. Senators arises, discuss various ideas for how two politicians can truly represent all the people in a state.&#160; Remember that, under current conditions, the only possibilities are that both Senators are Republicans, or both Senators are Democrats, or one Senator is a Republican and the other is a Democrat.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 20:&#160; Breaking Up:&#160; Going Beyond District Boundaries To Fairly Elect Representatives</h1> 
<p>Electing members of the U.S. House of Representatives requires extra election techniques that overcome boundary-issue complications.&#160; In this chapter you will learn how to fairly elect U.S. Representatives.&#160; The same approach also works for electing state legislators.</p> 
<h1>Capital In The U.S. Capitol</h1> 
<p>This chapter explains how to elect Representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives and representatives in a state legislature.&#160; Notice that when the word <b>Representatives</b> refers to the ones in Congress, the word is capitalized.&#160; Without capitalization the word <b>representatives</b> can refer to either, or both, kinds of representatives.&#160; When this distinction is important, the meaning is specified.</p> 
<h1>Defeating Boundary Manipulations</h1> 
<p>The election of representatives involves two important differences compared to the election of Mayors, Governors, U.S. Senators, and Presidents.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>One difference is the number of openings.&#160; In the case of Mayors, Governors, and President, there is only one opening to be filled.&#160; In the case of U.S. Senators there are two openings.&#160; In the case of representatives there are many equivalent openings to be filled.</li> 
<li>The other difference is how difficult, or easy, it is to change the boundary that determines which voters elect an official or representative.&#160; In the case of electing Mayors, Sheriffs, Governors, and President, the voters who vote in these elections are determined by city, county, state, and national boundaries, and these boundaries rarely change.&#160; In the case of electing representatives, the voters who elect each representative are determined by district boundaries, and district boundaries are changed regularly.&#160; In fact, district boundaries for Representatives in Congress are adjusted every ten years.</li> 
</ul> 
<h1>Districtwide And Statewide</h1> 
<p>There is more than one fair way to elect representatives.&#160; One approach is to elect two <i><b>districtwide</b></i> representatives from each double-size district using the same approach as electing U.S. Senators.&#160; This approach is described in the next section.&#160; The other fair approach, which has some of the characteristics of proportional representation, fills one or more <i><b>statewide</b></i> representative seats.&#160; This second approach is explained later in this chapter.&#160; Each state would be free to choose either or both of these methods.&#160; <b>The combination of using both districtwide and statewide representatives provides the fairest results</b>.&#160; Of course both election methods involve VoteFair ranking.</p> 
<p>Both methods involve increasing the size of representative districts.&#160; As previously explained (in Chapter 9), intrastate (within-a-state) geographical differences are not important in Congress.&#160; Similarly, increasing the size of districts for electing representatives in a state legislature would increase, not decrease, fairness.</p> 
<h1>Two Per District</h1> 
<p>How should districtwide representatives be chosen?&#160; Two representatives would be elected from each double-size district.&#160; It shouldn't surprise you that they can be chosen using the same approach that works for electing two Senators from a state.&#160; What does this mean?</p> 
<p><b>The most popular candidate &#8212; as determined using VoteFair ranking &#8212; should be chosen as the first districtwide representative, and the second-most representative candidate &#8212; as determined using VoteFair representation ranking &#8212; should be chosen as the second districtwide representative</b>.</p> 
<p>Surprisingly the Constitution would not need to be amended to allow two U.S. Representatives to be elected from each double-size district.&#160; The Constitution simply states: <i>The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several States</i>.&#160; The details about electing Representatives are left up to each state.</p> 
<p>Would this approach of electing two districtwide representatives from each double-size district produce fair results?&#160; The results would be fair if there continues to be an indirect limit of only two main political parties in the United States.&#160; When the voting methods used within Congress and within state legislatures eventually accommodate more than two main parties, then the number of districtwide representatives should be decreased, and the number of statewide representatives should be increased (by the same number).</p> 
<h1>Statewide Representatives</h1> 
<p>Some of the seats in each state's legislature, and some of the seats among the U.S. Representatives from a state, should be designated as <i><b>statewide representative</b></i> seats.&#160; Statewide representatives would be elected in a way that is similar to proportional representation (which is explained in Chapter 4).&#160; But instead of using party lists (either the open or closed types), the winners are identified using cross-district popularity ranking, which is explained later in this chapter.</p> 
<p>The purpose of using statewide representatives is to provide a way to elect representatives from a political party that is popular throughout the state, but not popular enough to get their candidates elected in as many districts as they deserve.&#160; To identify the popularity of each party we can look at the political-party preferences of each voter.&#160; Although voters indicate their full order of preference for political parties, only the voter's most preferred party would be used for this purpose.&#160; If a voter marks two or more parties as tied for their first choice, the single vote would get split into an equal amount for each most-preferred party.</p> 
<p>To appreciate the improved fairness of using statewide representatives, let's consider an example.&#160; Let's suppose that out of 100 voters in a state, the first-choice party preferences indicate that 60 voters prefer the Red party, 30 voters prefer the Blue party, and 10 voters prefer the White party.&#160; The next illustration shows these sample preferences, along with boundaries for 10 districts.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_346_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 346" width="580" height="707"/></p> 
<p>What would be the result of using traditional single-mark ballots to elect a representative from each of these ten districts?&#160; Every district would elect a representative from the Red party.&#160; Not a single representative would be from the Blue or White party.&#160; Obviously this approach does not produce representative results.</p> 
<p>Now suppose there are five districts and each district elects two representatives.&#160; The voters in this example are evenly distributed, so each of the five districts contains 12 Red voters, six Blue voters, and two White voters.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_347_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 347" width="580" height="703"/></p> 
<p>With this approach each district elects one Red representative as the most representative.&#160; After removing the influence of the voters who are sufficient to elect the five Red representatives, which party would be second-most representative (based on VoteFair representation ranking)?&#160; Cross-party preferences, especially among the voters whose first choice is the White party, affect the results, but we don't have that detailed information in this example.&#160; Let's suppose the second-most representative choices are Red representatives in two districts and Blue representatives in three districts.</p> 
<p>Overall the result is seven Red representatives and three Blue representatives.&#160; This result is an improvement over 10 Red representatives, but it leaves the 10 White voters completely unrepresented, the Blue voters under-represented, and the Red voters over-represented.</p> 
<p>In terms of proportionally matching voters with their party preferences, what would be an ideal match?&#160; Six Red representatives would represent the 60 Red voters, four Blue representatives would represent the 40 Blue voters, and one White representative would represent the 10 White voters.&#160; Let's call these <i><b>target</b></i> numbers.&#160; Proportional representation uses these target numbers as a goal for how many seats each party deserves to win.&#160; These target numbers are not necessarily achieved; that's why they are called target numbers.</p> 
<p>The target numbers in this example are easy to calculate.&#160; How can target numbers be calculated in a real situation?&#160; Let a computer programmer tell a computer how to calculate the numbers.&#160; If you are a computer programmer, just multiply the number of voters with each first-party preference by the total number of representatives (both districtwide and statewide), and then divide by the total number of voters, but don't round off the results.</p> 
<p>In hopes of improving the political-party match between voters and representatives, let's add two statewide representatives to our example.&#160; The state still gets only ten representatives, so the number of districtwide representatives must be reduced to eight representatives.&#160; Each district elects two representatives, so there are now four districts.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_349_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 349" width="579" height="750"/></p> 
<p>In all four districts Red candidates would win as the first-most representative.&#160; Let's suppose that the second-most representative choices are Red representatives in three districts and a Blue representative in the fourth district.</p> 
<p>Now we know that seven of the district representatives are from the Red party, and one district representative is from the Blue party.</p> 
<p>Even before going through the steps of identifying the parties of the two statewide representatives (which will be described shortly), it's apparent that the Red party will not be winning any statewide representative seats.&#160; How do we know this?&#160; Its number of districtwide wins, which is seven, exceeds the party's target number of six.</p> 
<p>Is it unfair for a party to win more &#8212; or fewer &#8212; representative seats compared to the ideal?&#160; No, it is not unfair.&#160; Consider that electing a single person to become U.S. President involves unfairness because the voters in the losing party are not represented, yet this lack of representation is seldom regarded as unfair.</p> 
<h1>Party Orientations Of Statewide Representatives</h1> 
<p>How are the party orientations of statewide representatives determined?&#160; The winning party for each statewide representative seat is determined one seat at a time.&#160; This approach allows the political parties of the recently assigned statewide representatives to be taken into consideration when the winner of the next seat is determined.</p> 
<p>If you don't like dealing with numbers, please skip over the following steps guilt-free.&#160; For the benefit of those who are interested, here is an explanation of how the political-party orientation of one statewide representative seat is determined.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Count the number of statewide and districtwide representative seats that, so far, have been won by each political party.&#160; In the current example so far, the Red party has won 7 seats, the Blue party has won 1 seat, and the White party has won zero seats.</li> 
<li>For each political party, subtract the numbers from step 1 from the target numbers.&#160; In the current example, this produces the number negative one (don't worry, it is ignored in the next step) for the Red party, the number 2 for the Blue party, and the number 1 for the White party.</li> 
<li>Ignore any negative numbers produced in step 2, and ignore any zero values.&#160; From among the remaining numbers, identify the largest number and identify the party associated with this largest number.&#160; In the current example, the largest number is 2, and it applies to the Blue party.&#160; (If there is a tie, a judicial court or a random approach can resolve the tie.)</li> 
<li>The political party identified in step 3 wins the next statewide representative seat.&#160; In the current example, the Blue party wins the first statewide representative seat.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Although we don't yet know which candidate will win the first statewide representative seat, we now know that it will be someone from the Blue party.&#160; Repeating the steps above reveals that the Blue party also wins the second statewide representative seat.&#160; This means that the 40 voters who prefer the Blue party will be represented by a total of 3 representatives (two statewide and one districtwide) from the Blue party.</p> 
<p>The final result of seven Red representatives and three Blue representatives does not achieve the target numbers of six Red representatives, four Blue representatives, and one White representative.&#160; Yet it's still fair, especially compared to using traditional voting methods.</p> 
<h1>Filling Statewide Representative Seats</h1> 
<p>Now that we know which political parties have won the statewide representative seats, we are ready to determine which candidates from these parties deserve to win these seats.</p> 
<p>The candidates for the statewide seats should be from among the candidates for the districtwide seats.&#160; Why?&#160; It would be unfair for a very popular candidate to fail to get elected just because he or she made the wrong choice about whether to compete for a districtwide or statewide seat.</p> 
<p>Identifying the statewide popularity of candidates from each party involves looking at the general-election results in each district.&#160; How can the popularity of one candidate in one district be compared with the popularity of another candidate in another district?&#160; Here are steps that explain how to determine cross-district popularities.&#160; These steps are repeated for each statewide representative seat won by each party.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Consider only the candidates who are from the target party, which is the political party that has won the statewide seat being filled.&#160; These are called <i><b>same-party candidates</b></i>.</li> 
<li>Identify the ballots of what are called <i><b>same-party voters</b></i>.&#160; A same-party voter is someone whose most-preferred party is the target party.&#160; Ballots on which a voter indicates a first-choice preference for any other political party, and ballots on which a voter ranks more than one political party as their first choice, do not fit this requirement.</li> 
<li>Count the number of same-party voters who prefer each same-party candidate as their first choice.</li> 
<li>From among the same-party candidates who have not yet won a seat, identify the candidate who is preferred by the highest number of same-party voters.&#160; This candidate wins the statewide representative seat.</li> 
</ol> 
<p>Notice that the choice of who wins is entirely based on voter preferences.&#160; This is fairer than proportional representation's closed-party list approach in which political-party leaders choose which candidates fill the seats.</p> 
<p>Although VoteFair ranking is not used in these steps, consider that VoteFair ranking is used in the <i>primary</i> election to identify, for each district, the one or two candidates from each party who deserve to be on the general-election ballot.&#160; With each party having no more than two candidates in each district's general-election race, VoteFair ranking is not needed to compare the popularity of same-party candidates within a district.&#160; To avoid vote-splitting effects in the cross-district comparisons, special counting is needed for the ballots that rank both same-party candidates at the top.</p> 
<p>You now know how representatives &#8212; particularly Congressmen and state legislators &#8212; should be elected.&#160; Of course the steps described in this chapter are handled by computers.&#160; By understanding the steps you now know that there is no real magic involved.&#160; More importantly, you understand there is no unfairness involved.&#160; By contrast, unfairness exists in our current methods of electing representatives, which is why representatives are now so unrepresentative.</p> 
<p>If the steps seem confusing, consider that from a voter's perspective it simply amounts to marking candidate preferences for one race in the primary election and one race in the general election.</p> 
<h1>Recommendations For Parliamentary Elections</h1> 
<p>The voting methods described in this chapter also provide a fairer approach for parliamentary democracies that want to improve how they elect their members of Parliament.&#160; Fairness would increase significantly because traditional proportional representation either allows political-party leaders to control which politicians get elected, or unfair plurality voting is used to identify candidate popularities.&#160; In contrast, the proportional representation method described in this chapter gives full control to the voters, and it takes control away from political-party leaders (who are heavily influenced by campaign contributions).</p> 
<p>Keep in mind that VoteFair ranking in the primary election, and limiting the number of candidates from each party in the districtwide main election, are important ingredients in correctly identifying the winners of provincewide and nationwide seats, which are similar to statewide seats in the U.S. version.&#160; Without this primary-election pre-screening, the recommended method for identifying cross-district (or cross-province) popularities significantly loses it's fairness.</p> 
<p>The method described in this chapter intentionally reduces the number of political parties.&#160; This gives voters more control over the agenda of the ruling party or ruling coalition.&#160; More parties can be supported by making adjustments that take into account the situation of the country in which it is used.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; If you want to improve how the Congressmen in your state are elected, promote the use of VoteFair ranking and ranked ballots in simpler election situations such as electing officials in a small organization, electing your city's Mayor, and electing your state's Governor.&#160; When the fairness of these improvements have become clear, there will be support for making Congressional elections fairer.&#160; When that happens, if you have an opportunity to make a recommendation, simply recommend using the methods explained in this chapter.&#160; Alternatively you can recommend the legal wording at the <b>VoteFair.org</b> website.</p> 
<p>If someone recommends using European methods of proportional representation in the United States, point out that fairer results are achieved by using VoteFair ranking to elect districtwide representatives from double-size districts.</p> 
<p>If someone in a foreign country expresses frustration about the excessive influence of campaign contributions in their country's parliamentary elections, point out that this chapter describes ways to improve the fairness of choosing candidates in proportional representation elections.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 21:&#160; Bored Org:&#160; Board-of-Director Elections The Right Way</h1> 
<p>Each nonprofit organization, large corporation, and public school system is run by a Board of Directors (or equivalent) whose members are elected.&#160; In this chapter let's explore how board-member elections should be conducted to make them fair.&#160; The ability of VoteFair representation ranking to identify the second-most representative and third-most representative candidates is especially useful when these elections involve multiple equivalent seats.</p> 
<h1>Right Way</h1> 
<p>What makes board-of-director membership so special?&#160; <b>Some or all of the positions on a Board of Directors are exactly equivalent to each other</b>.&#160; In other words, if two equivalent seats are open, a candidate for one of the seats is also qualified for the other seat.&#160; For this reason it makes sense to require all the candidates for equivalent seats to compete in a single race.</p> 
<p>Sometimes a Board of Directors consists of seats that are not equivalent.&#160; For example, there may be a seat reserved for an employee so that employees get a voice in the organization's decisions.&#160; Candidates for a special kind of seat must compete in a separate contest.</p> 
<p>Here is an example of a ranked ballot that shows six candidates competing for three open &#8212; and equivalent &#8212; seats.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_356_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 356" width="580" height="490"/></p> 
<h1>Representation Ranking</h1> 
<p>Obviously when there is only one available seat of a particular kind, it should go to the most popular candidate based on VoteFair popularity ranking.&#160; The winner also can be identified using VoteFair representation ranking because the most representative candidate is also the most popular.</p> 
<p><b>When there is a second available seat, the second-most representative candidate &#8212; based on VoteFair representation ranking &#8212; should win the second seat</b>.&#160; If there are more open seats of the same kind, they should be filled by the next-most-representative candidates.&#160; Remember that VoteFair representation ranking ensures that the majority of voters who choose the first winner can't by themselves also choose the second winner.</p> 
<p>For the sample election that uses the previous ballot, let's suppose this table shows the representation ranking of the candidates.</p> 
<p><img src="images/image_ehu_page_357_fig_1.png" alt="Figure 1 on page 357" width="580" height="324"/></p> 
<p>In this example the three open and equivalent seats would be won by Florence, Barney, and Kristin.</p> 
<h1>Wrong Way</h1> 
<p>To appreciate the fairness of this recommended approach, consider how most organizations currently elect board members.</p> 
<p>Usually each candidate must choose which seat he or she wants to compete for, there is a separate election for each seat, and plurality voting is used to identify the winner of each seat.&#160; Requiring candidates to choose a specific seat introduces many unfairnesses.&#160; As an example, suppose a widely appreciated candidate competes for one seat while four average candidates compete for the other two seats.&#160; Suppose the widely appreciated candidate is disliked by other board members and those board members talk a popular former board member into running for the same seat.&#160; The widely appreciated candidate may lose even though he or she is clearly a better choice compared to whichever two average candidates win the other two seats.&#160; Requiring that all the candidates compete together in the same race, and using VoteFair representation ranking to correctly identify the winners, overcomes such seat-choice strategies.</p> 
<p>Some organizations attempt to overcome seat-choice unfairness by using approval voting, with the candidates for the equivalent seats competing together in the same race.&#160; As previously explained (in Chapter 7), approval voting allows each voter to give one mark each to as many candidates as there are open seats, and the winners are the candidates who receive the most marks.&#160; As previously explained, approval voting can produce unfair results because it is very vulnerable to strategic voting.&#160; Approval voting is useful because it enables a minority to focus its votes on a single candidate and have a chance of electing that candidate.&#160; VoteFair representation ranking provides better benefits than approval voting, and lacks its disadvantages.</p> 
<p>The biggest unfairness in board-member elections occurs when only one candidate competes for each open seat.&#160; This approach is commonly used by most large corporations.&#160; Without any competition, voting is reduced to a shareholder either approving or disapproving of each candidate.&#160; Such candidates easily win more than half the votes.&#160; Who nominates the candidate in such cases?&#160; The corporate executives, largest shareholders, and board members do the nominating.&#160; <b>Corporations that offer only one candidate for each seat fail to provide fair elections for the investors who own the corporation</b>.</p> 

<p>Single-candidate, single-seat, board-member elections have been tolerated partly because traditional voting methods cannot provide fair results in a situation such as four candidates competing for three seats.&#160; Now that computers and VoteFair ranking make these situations practical, a large corporation should nominate at least one more candidate than the number of seats.&#160; This approach provides shareholders with what they deserve: at least some influence in board-member elections.</p> 
<p>The fair way to elect board members may not be welcomed in many corporations and some nonprofit organizations, but a fairer alternative is now available.</p> 
<h1>School-Board Elections</h1> 
<p>Electing members of a school board can involve complexities beyond the explanations in this chapter.&#160; For example, although multiple seats may appear to be equivalent, there may be rules that make them different.&#160; A common approach is to fill each seat with someone from a different part of the city.</p> 
<p>For some kinds of school boards the recommendations for electing representatives (described in Chapter 20) may be useful for electing board members.&#160; In particular, it may be useful to elect two members from each geographic area, with VoteFair representation ranking being used to overcome a tyranny of the majority.&#160; In addition, it may be useful to elect city-wide board members similar to the way statewide representatives are elected.&#160; However, primary elections and the ranking of political parties should not be involved in school-board elections.</p> 
<p>Regardless of how the seats are filled, ranked ballots should be used for each race.&#160; Anything less fails to provide the preference information needed for fair results.</p> 
<h1>Taking Action</h1> 
<p>What can you do with what you learned in this chapter?&#160; If you own any stock and you receive a ballot to vote for board members, notice whether any of the seats have more than one candidate.&#160; If so, vote to take advantage of this rare opportunity.&#160; If not, and you have the time, consider withholding your approval of any candidates who seem less qualified or overly compensated.&#160; Although this probably won't change the results, it may help the corporate directors realize that shareholders do care about the choices.</p> 
<p>If you are involved with a nonprofit organization that uses unfair elections for its Board of Directors, recommend adopting fairer voting methods.&#160; Especially for seats that are equivalent, require all the candidates to compete in the same race, use ranked ballots, and use VoteFair representation ranking to identify which candidates deserve to win.</p> 
<p>If you choose to recommend fairer voting methods for electing board members, recommend this book to the people who might be in a position to design the replacement election method.</p> 

<h1>Chapter 22:&#160; Action!:&#160; Putting Words Into Action</h1> 
<p>Now it's time to take action!&#160; This chapter provides suggestions about where to start.</p> 
<h1>Growing By Word-Of-Mouth</h1> 
<p>Ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking are slowly growing in use.&#160; These fairer voting methods have been used in small organizations, among small groups of people, and in survey questions.&#160; Knowledge of these fairer methods is spreading through word-of-mouth, online forums, online searches, and this book.</p> 
<p>Soon these fairer voting methods will be used in a few local government elections.&#160; Over time, they will be adopted by a few state governments for electing legislators and Governors.&#160; By this time the two main political parties will begin to shift their agendas closer to what most voters want &#8212; in hopes of preventing the adoption of fair voting methods at the national level.&#160; At about this time, a few other countries will adopt ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking for use throughout their country.&#160; Later, after seeing the political and economic success of countries that adopt the voting methods, other countries will adopt these fairer voting methods.&#160; Eventually, more than a couple of decades from now, an amendment to the U.S. Constitution will be ratified and fair voting methods will finally be used to elect Congressmen and the U.S. President.</p> 
<p>Why won't fair voting methods be adopted more quickly at the national level?&#160; Many voters rely on television for their news, and television networks are owned by large corporations who currently use money to manipulate election results in favor of these corporations.&#160; These and other corporations will not only discourage the use of fairer voting methods, but they will continue to make large campaign contributions to politicians who quietly oppose voting reforms.&#160; However, eventually U.S. corporations and wealthy individuals will finally realize they are losing out on economic prosperity by clinging to unfair voting methods, and then they will finally appreciate the benefits of fairer elections.</p> 
<p>Two centuries from now children will read about the adoption of ranked ballots and fair ranking methods and they will wonder why primitive single-mark ballots were used for so long, just as today's children wonder why tyrannical kings and dictators were tolerated for so long before the United States became the first country to successfully adopt democracy.</p> 
<p>What would the founding fathers of the United States think about our generation altering the Constitution to improve the fairness of Presidential elections?&#160; Remember that it was during Thomas Jefferson's presidency that the Constitution was amended to correct a serious oversight in the Presidential election process.&#160; And Thomas Jefferson once wrote, &#8220;I hold it that a little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing, and as necessary in the political world as storms are in the physical.&#160; ....&#160; It is medicine necessary for the sound health of government.&#8221;</p> 
<h1>Obstacles Of Course</h1> 
<p>There is always resistance to anything new.&#160; This is the way it should be.&#160; Resistance filters out the many bad, foolish, and poorly designed ideas that some people inevitably suggest.&#160; Fortunately, well-designed good ideas can overcome this healthy resistance.&#160; So when you encounter resistance to your suggestions, instead of attacking the resistance, recognize that you have an opportunity to educate people about why single-mark ballots and traditional ballot-interpretation methods are primitive, and why ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking produce much fairer results.</p> 
<p>The other kind of resistance you will encounter is distraction.&#160; Many citizens are easily distracted by less-important voting issues, such as correctly counting mis-marked ballots and questioning the fairness of using electoral votes.&#160; These distractions draw attention away from the collection and interpretation of full preference information.</p> 
<h1>It's A Wrap!</h1> 
<p>You now know what's wrong with how politicians are elected, and you know how to get much fairer results.&#160; What remains is to decide whether you want to participate in promoting fairer voting methods by taking action.</p> 
<p>If you are ready to take action, and know where to start, put this book down now and begin!</p> 
<p>If you aren't sure where to start, here are some possibilities for what you can do.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Create a simple one-question survey that involves ranking something such as budget decisions, talent-contest participants, or musical preferences.&#160; Use the free service at VoteFair.org to create the ballot for your survey question.&#160; Either using a printed copy of the ballot or a link to the interactive ballot, ask appropriately chosen friends, coworkers, and family members to indicate their order of preference for the alternatives in your survey question.&#160; Then enter the preferences from paper ballots and view the VoteFair ranking results.&#160; Study the results to verify that they make sense.&#160; Now you are ready to know how to handle the next situation in which there is an opportunity to use a fairer voting method.</li> 
<li>Identify a situation where you and a few other people make use of voting.&#160; This situation might be a meeting with coworkers, a volunteer organization you are in, making decisions as a family, or participating in a student survey.&#160; Decide how best to recommend improving the collection and interpretation of votes, and then take action to implement that improvement.</li> 
<li>Look at the action suggestions at the end of each chapter in this book, find one that interests you, and then act on it.</li> 
<li>Still reading?&#160; Okay, look at the summary in the next section and go on to the closing chapter to find out what awaits civilization when fairer voting methods are finally adopted.</li> 
</ul> 
<h1>It's Summary Time</h1> 
<p>Now that you are ready for action, here is a list of different voting situations and, for each one, the key characteristics that produce fair results.</p> 
<p><b>Decisions</b>:&#160; Use ranked ballots and VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the most popular course of action &#8212; besides the do-nothing option.&#160; Then, in a second round of voting, use traditional two-choice ballots to decide between the most popular course of action and making no change.&#160; (See Chapter 14)</p> 
<p><b>Ranking-type survey questions</b>:&#160; Use ranked ballots and VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the overall popularity ranking (most popular, second-most popular, third-most popular, etc.).&#160; (See VoteFair.org)</p> 
<p><b>President, treasurer, or secretary of a small organization, nonpartisan Sheriff or Judge</b>:&#160; Use ranked ballots and VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the most popular candidate in each race.&#160; (See Chapter 13)</p> 
<p><b>School-board members, corporate board members, nonprofit organization's board members</b>:&#160; Require candidates to compete together in the same race if they are competing for equivalent seats.&#160; Use ranked ballots.&#160; For each race in which there is only one seat, use VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the most popular candidate.&#160; For each race in which there are multiple seats, use VoteFair representation ranking and give the first seat to the most representative candidate, the second seat to the second-most representative candidate, and so on.&#160; (See Chapter 21)</p> 
<p><b>City Mayor, state Governor, state Treasurer, Secretary of State</b>:&#160; At the general election two years in advance, use ranked ballots that list all the political parties registered in the state.&#160; Use VoteFair party ranking (as explained in Chapter 16) to identify the ranking of each political party in each city, county, and state.&#160; In the primary election, within each political party, use ranked ballots and VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the popularity of the candidates.&#160; In the general election, use ranked ballots that list the two most popular candidates from each of the two highest-ranked parties and the most popular candidate each from the next three highest-ranked parties.&#160; Use VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the most popular candidate in each race.&#160; (See Chapter 17)</p> 
<p><b>State representative</b>:&#160; At the general election two years in advance, use ranked ballots that list all the political parties registered in the state.&#160; Use VoteFair party ranking (as explained in Chapter 16) to identify the ranking of each political party in each double-size district.&#160; In the primary election, within each political party, use ranked ballots and VoteFair popularity ranking to identify the popularity of the candidates.&#160; In the general election, use ranked ballots that list the three or four most popular candidates from each of the two highest-ranked parties and the most popular candidate each from the next three highest-ranked parties.&#160; Use VoteFair representation ranking to identify the two most representative candidates in each double-size district.&#160; If improvements in representation are needed, also use statewide representative seats, which do not involve collecting additional preference information.&#160; (See Chapter 20)</p> 
<p><b>U.S. Representative</b>:&#160; Same as state-representative elections except that at least one Representative is a statewide Representative.&#160; Low-population states that have fewer than five Representatives might not have any districtwide Representatives.&#160; The political parties that win the statewide Representative seats are based on using the highest-ranked political party on each ballot to calculate target numbers for each party, and assigning each statewide seat to the party that, so far, has the biggest gap between its target number and the number of seats won by that party.&#160; The statewide Representative seat is filled by the same-party candidate who lost in a districtwide election yet is top-ranked by the most same-party voters.&#160; (See Chapter 20)</p> 
<p><b>U.S. Senator</b>:&#160; If both Senators can be elected in the same race, elect the two most representative based on VoteFair representation ranking.&#160; If Senators must be elected in different years (as currently required by the Constitution), use VoteFair popularity ranking to elect the most popular candidate who is not from the same political party as the other Senator.&#160; In the first case, the two top parties each get their four most popular candidates on the general-election ballot.&#160; In the second case, the party of the other Senator does not get any candidate on the ballot, and the other top party gets its two most popular candidates on the ballot.&#160; In both cases, the next-two highest ranked parties get one candidate each.&#160; Otherwise, Senatorial elections are similar to electing state representatives.&#160; (See Chapter 19)</p> 
<p><b>U.S. President</b>:&#160; At the general election two years in advance, include within the state-based lists of political parties all parties that within the last nine years have had at least one U.S. Congressman.&#160; Use VoteFair party ranking with electoral-vote adjustments to identify the nationwide ranking of all these political parties.&#160; In the Presidential primary, use ranked ballots and VoteFair popularity ranking with electoral-vote adjustments to identify the two most popular candidates in each of the two top parties, and identify the most popular candidate in each of the next-three highest-ranked parties.&#160; In the general election, use ranked ballots that list these Presidential candidates and their Vice Presidential running mates, and use VoteFair popularity ranking with electoral-vote adjustments to identify the most popular Presidential and Vice Presidential pair.&#160; For electoral-vote adjustments, count the ballots into a tally table for each state, convert these numbers into electoral votes with each state getting one less electoral vote than now, combine (using addition) all the state tally tables into a nationwide tally table, and use these numbers to calculate the sequence scores.&#160; (See Chapter 18 and the proposed constitutional amendment at VoteFair.org)</p> 
<p><b>Parliament members (outside the United States)</b>:&#160; Same as U.S. Representative elections, except designate about one-fourth of the parliamentary seats to be provincewide parliamentary seats (similar to statewide representative seats) and designate 10 or more parliamentary seats to be nationwide parliamentary seats.&#160; Voting for political parties must involve ranking all parties, not just marking a single favorite.&#160; (See Chapter 20)</p> 

<h1>Chapter 23:&#160; Crystal Ball:&#160; What's Ahead?</h1> 
<p>It's time to bring this book to a close.&#160; This chapter provides a glimpse into the future to answer the question, &#8220;What will happen after ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking have been adopted?&#8221;</p> 
<h1>Increased Democracy Brings Increased Prosperity</h1> 
<p>Politicians of today are blocking us from reaching a much more prosperous future.&#160; It's ironic.&#160; In their campaign speeches politicians directly and indirectly promise increased prosperity, yet when they get into office, politicians maintain the barriers that block us from reaching the greater prosperity that awaits us.&#160; In a similar way European tyrants of 300 years ago claimed they would provide prosperity to their citizens, yet their tyrannical actions blocked both the tyrants and average citizens from reaching current levels of prosperity.&#160; History is repeating itself, so let's take a look into the past and learn from it.</p> 
<p>The United States of America was founded on the basis of democracy.&#160; The strong desire for democracy arose out of the abuses of power by European tyrants.&#160; Those tyrants and their supporters caused lots of unnecessary and unfair suffering, and they also engaged in selfish pursuits that wasted most of the money collected in taxes.&#160; As the founders of the United States expected, democracy greatly reduced the unfair suffering and greatly reduced the waste of taxpayer's money.&#160; But the prosperity of the United States went far beyond what most people expected.&#160; As more countries converted to democracy, the link between democracy and prosperity became clearer, so that now democracy has become desirable for the purpose of increasing a nation's prosperity, not just as a way to end the abuses of tyranny.&#160; Let's explore this link between levels of democracy and levels of prosperity.</p> 
<p>First, let's clarify what kind of prosperity we're talking about.&#160; We can do so by comparing the prosperity we enjoy today with the prosperity of wealthy European tyrants of a few centuries ago.&#160; Those tyrants, in spite of their wealth, were not able to obtain fresh fruits and vegetables year-round, but now average citizens in a democracy can easily buy fresh produce year-round from a neighborhood market.&#160; Wealthy tyrants traveled in fancy carriages, but compared to automobile travel of today, those tyrants experienced slow speeds, bumpiness, breakdowns, coldness in winter, and unscheduled stops for robbery.&#160; Wealthy tyrants and their families were vulnerable to sickness and death because even the best medical care was primitive, and because murders were relatively common.&#160; Even the wealthiest tyrants didn't get daily hot showers, and they didn't enjoy the reduced odor of flushing toilets.&#160; Wealthy tyrants, with the help of servants, enjoyed relative warmth in winter and dim light at night, but they inhaled smoke from fireplaces and lanterns, and the smoke undermined their health.&#160; The best available entertainment in their time consisted of plays, concerts, and operas, so people of that time could not have imagined being able to watch sophisticated movies and listen to beautiful music anytime and anywhere.&#160; Wealthy tyrants were able to occasionally visit, or be visited by, distant relatives and friends, but otherwise they had to stay in touch through written letters carried by carriage and horseback, and the idea of talking to someone far away, as we now do on the telephone, was unimaginable.&#160; Finally, and very importantly, quality education was limited to relatively few books that contained relatively little knowledge compared to the vast knowledge that is available today in public libraries and on the Internet.</p> 
<p>Perhaps you're thinking that advances in technology account for these improvements.&#160; That's true, but notice that many of these innovations and inventions &#8212; including high-quality Hollywood movies, world-popular forms of music, and the biggest advances in telephone, radio, television, computer, aircraft, and satellite technologies &#8212; developed in the United States, not Europe.&#160; For reasons you will soon learn, innovations and inventions flourish in a democracy more than in a tyranny.&#160; So it was the advances in U.S. democracy that significantly increased technological progress.&#160; Ironically current limitations in democracy &#8212; not limitations in science or technology &#8212; prevent us from quickly achieving yet more technological progress.</p> 
<p>Civilization is now poised to move up to the next level of democracy.&#160; As you've learned in this book, VoteFair ranking is a key component in this increased democracy.</p> 
<p>Nations that achieve the next level of democracy also will achieve dramatically increased prosperity.&#160; What will that prosperity look like?&#160; Let's take a peek into the future, 200 years from now (or sooner if worldwide democracy evolves more quickly).&#160; Here is what you would see.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>In that future there will be perfectly controlled air temperatures, and perfectly controlled water temperatures in showers and faucets.</li> 
<li>The power for heating and cooling will be inexpensive and come from non-polluting and non-radioactive sources.</li> 
<li>Much faster ground transportation over long distances will be available with very little advance notice, and local transportation will be much safer than riding in a car today.</li> 
<li>Much of the power for transportation will come from liquid fuels that are manufactured using solar energy, water, and air (as explained in a later section).</li> 
<li>Overnight delivery of packages from other states will be standard, and driverless (and passengerless) vehicles will quickly fetch items from local stores and food from nearby restaurants.</li> 
<li>Improvements in voice recognition (such as the <i>Quick Rolling Spectral Transform</i> algorithm) will nearly eliminate the use of keyboards for writing words, and for writing software code (which will become speakable, as in the <i>Dashrep</i> language).</li> 
<li>Device-assisted conversations between people who do not speak the same language will require learning only a few new (language-specific) words that are currently missing from all spoken languages, and learning a universal grammar that technology can easily translate.</li> 
<li>Crimes of robbery, theft, assault, and murder will be far less common than today.</li> 
<li>Home entertainment will make most of today's movies and TV shows seem amateurish.</li> 
<li>The average person will have health care that makes today's best-trained doctors and best-equipped hospitals seem unhealthy.</li> 
<li>Many homes will have a kitchen appliance that uses remotely controlled robotic arms to clean, peel, chop, measure, and do other food-preparation tasks so that a fresh dinner will be ready to heat or ready to eat.</li> 
<li>Vastly improved public education will provide well-designed interactive experiences that will efficiently teach at the elementary-school level much of what today is covered in introductory college classes.</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Within 200 years most of these advances will be available to average people living in a true democracy.</p> 
<p>Based on this peek into the future it's clear that people living in the future will look back on us today and regard us as rather primitive, just as we regard the cultures of old European tyrannies as rather primitive.&#160; That probably isn't surprising to you.&#160; But what will surprise most people living today is that people living in the future will recognize that <b>our primitive version of democracy is what held us back from achieving greater prosperity and faster technological development</b>.</p> 
<p>Lots of people realize that today's unfair election results lead to politicians channeling lots of money from taxpayers and consumers to the politician's biggest campaign contributors, and this unfairness and frustration is recognized as a problem needing to be solved.&#160; But it's time to look beyond the unfairness problem and recognize an opportunity.&#160; The opportunity is to achieve better living conditions &#8212; for everyone &#8212; by increasing the fairness of election results.</p> 
<p>Of course today's politicians think they know how to achieve increased prosperity.&#160; In Eastern Europe where democracy has replaced tyranny, the new politicians embrace the idea of a free market and entrepreneurial businesses, and these changes will indeed lead to some increases in prosperity.&#160; Throughout Europe, nations have joined together to form the European Union in hopes that this arrangement will provide the same economic advantage as the high level of cooperation between the 50 states of the United States, and this change will indeed lead to some increases in prosperity.&#160; But the greatest gains in the prosperity of every nation have arisen, and will arise again, from factors that both U.S. and European politicians have stopped accommodating.&#160; Let's explore these factors and gain a renewed appreciation for their ability to increase prosperity.</p> 
<h1>Fairer Taxes</h1> 
<p>In the future, after fairer voting methods have been adopted, the fairness of tax laws will improve dramatically.&#160; As you learned in Chapter 2 (<i>What Does The Money Buy?</i>), one of the most valuable benefits gained by the biggest campaign contributors is reduced taxes (mostly through higher tax credits, unfairly low tax rates, and tax loopholes).</p> 
<p>Which kinds of businesses have &#8220;bought&#8221; these reduced taxes?&#160; According to information published at <a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/industries/" title="www.OpenSecrets.org/industries/" class="classLink"><i>OpenSecrets.org</i></a>, these are the industries that contributed the most money to the 2012 Congressional election campaigns.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Finance</li> 
<li>Insurance</li> 
<li>Real estate</li> 
<li>Health</li> 
<li>Lawyers</li> 
<li>Communications &amp; electronics</li> 
<li>Energy and natural resources</li> 
<li>Construction</li> 
<li>Agribusiness</li> 
<li>Transportation</li> 
<li>Defense</li> 
</ul> 
<p>These <i><b>taker</b></i> industries (with a few exceptions) should be paying higher taxes, not lower taxes.&#160; Why?&#160; The U.S. government and state governments have to spend lots of taxpayer money to regulate these businesses.&#160; Without such regulations these kinds of businesses tend to cheat their customers, their clients, and many citizens.&#160; The cheating occurs in ways such as selling at excessively high prices (defense contractors and financial institutions), buying at excessively low prices (natural resources extracted from government-owned land, and real estate that is re-zoned to a higher value after it is bought), over-charging (lawyers and telephone companies), refusing to make a promised payment without a court order (insurance companies), selling unhealthy and unsafe products (agribusiness, pharmaceutical companies, and construction businesses), polluting the environment (mining companies, and power plants that burn dirty coal or generate radioactive waste), and closing a business after collecting lots of money (banks and insurance companies).&#160; Economic prosperity suffers because these businesses successfully avoid paying nearly all the costs of regulating these kinds of businesses.</p> 
<p>This corrupt, yet legal, tax evasion shifts lots of the tax burden to the following business activities that deserve to pay lower taxes, not higher taxes.</p> 
<ul> 
<li>Cooking and food preparation (restaurants, bakeries, etc.)</li> 
<li>Manufacturing (physical, mechanical, chemical, pharmaceutical, electrical, electronic, apparel, textiles/fabrics, etc.)</li> 
<li>Engineering</li> 
<li>Inventing</li> 
<li>Software development</li> 
<li>Creating audience-focused entertainment (books, music, movies, stage shows, spectator sports, etc.)</li> 
<li>Teaching, educating, and training</li> 
<li>Research (pharmaceutical, chemical, high-tech, etc.)</li> 
</ul> 
<p>Why do these <i><b>maker</b></i> business activities deserve lower taxes?&#160; Because these kinds of businesses create new things of value that previously did not exist, and these new things of value dramatically increase economic prosperity &#8212; not just for the businesses but for the entire nation.&#160; Clear evidence of this increased value is conveyed by people in other nations being eager to buy the new things of value.</p> 
<p>In contrast, most of the businesses in the <i><b>taker</b></i> group focus on shifting ownership of things that already exist.&#160; In other words, taker businesses tend not to create anything new that is of value to someone other than a specific customer.&#160; This lack of value is apparent because foreigners do not want to buy the case-specific legal documents and other &#8220;things&#8221; that most taker businesses typically create.&#160; Of course foreigners are eager to buy extracted natural resources, but then future owners of the land are deprived of these natural resources.</p> 
<p>Farming and ranching already get well-deserved tax breaks because these are very important business activities.&#160; Eventually similar tax advantages will be extended to the other <i><b>maker</b></i> business activities that also create new things of value.</p> 
<p>Of course many business activities fit between the extremes of <i>maker</i> businesses and <i>taker</i> businesses, so here is the full range of business-category taxation levels.</p> 
<ol> 
<li>Farming (and ranching)</li> 
<li>Making (manufacturing, cooking, creating entertainment, writing software, etc.)</li> 
<li>Teaching</li> 
<li>Maintenance and healthcare</li> 
<li>Communication and packaging and transportation and storage (including retail businesses)</li> 
<li>Sales (and marketing)</li> 
<li>Taking (banking, stock-market trading, providing insurance, providing legal services, payday loaning, real estate development, mining, etc.)</li> 
</ol> 
<p>(If a business has activities that match more than one category, that business would have its tax rate adjusted accordingly.)</p> 
<p>The taker businesses (at the bottom of this list), tend to pay the lowest (effective) tax rates.&#160; That extra profitability attracts the most talented and best-educated employees, which is unfortunate because taker business tasks (such as filling out forms and tracking data) involve skills that are easier to learn and easier to automate.&#160; In contrast, the maker businesses (at the top of this list), tend to pay significantly higher taxes.&#160; This reduced profitability makes it harder to attract the most talented and best-educated employees, which is unfortunate because the valuable maker business activities, especially inventing and creating and design, are very difficult to learn and almost impossible to automate.</p> 
<p>The existing upside-down business-tax arrangement encourages economy-weakening <i>taker</i> activities, and discourages economy-strengthening <i>maker</i> activities.&#160; When business taxes are turned right-side-up, more people will pursue business activities that strengthen the economy, and fewer people will waste time and resources on activities that weaken, or at least fail to strengthen, the economy.</p> 
<p>(More information about this business-tax reform, which is called <i>Tax The Takers More Than The Makers</i>, is available at <a href="http://www.SolutionsCreative.com/tax_takers_more_than_makers.html" title="www.SolutionsCreative.com/tax_takers_more_than_makers.html" class="classLink">SolutionsCreative.com</a>.)</p> 
<p>Dramatic gains in economic prosperity will come to the nations that correct the existing upside-down tax-rate arrangement, which exists because of the excessive influence of money in politics.&#160; The economic benefits will be surprisingly dramatic, just as the economic gains of nations that first switched from dictatorship to democracy were surprisingly dramatic.&#160; The underlying reason is simple.&#160; When money is allowed to influence government, the natural consequence is corruption, and corruption undermines economic prosperity.</p> 
<h1>Freer Markets</h1> 
<p>Most economists agree that a free market, where businesses compete with one another, provides the best products at the best consumer prices.&#160; Yet the biggest campaign contributors use their excessive influence in ways that protect their businesses from competition.</p> 
<p>The U.S. healthcare system is an example of a non-free market.&#160; Pharmaceutical companies get laws passed that make it illegal for doctors and sellers of herbs to claim any health benefits for specific foods or herbs or even for drinking lots of water (to deal with kidney stones).&#160; This bias gives a competitive advantage to overpriced prescription drugs that have serious side effects, and that may only treat the symptoms without curing the underlying ailment.&#160; The inflated price for drugs in the United States is clear because pharmaceutical companies sell those drugs in Canada at significantly lower prices.&#160; Patients expect doctors to be experts in how the human body works, yet doctors become vulnerable to malpractice suits and trouble from the American Medical Association (AMA) if they stray from the mainstream dependence on drugs and surgery as the favored cures.&#160; Hospitals sell services to individuals at much higher prices than what hospitals charge to insurance companies, although this is difficult to verify because many hospitals do not know in advance how much they will charge for a specific procedure.</p> 
<p>How did Congress recently &#8220;reform&#8221; the overly expensive healthcare industry and &#8220;solve&#8221; the problem of health insurance being unaffordable?&#160; They have imposed a fine on any individual who does not buy health insurance, and under the new arrangement a healthy person must pay higher premiums to subsidize healthcare costs for people who smoke tobacco, consume too much alcohol, don't exercise, or pursue dangerous activities.&#160; This corrupt arrangement shifts more money to insurance companies, which undermines the prosperity of other businesses in other industries.&#160; In other words, this &#8220;reform&#8221; fails to solve the underlying problem of drugs and surgeries being excessively expensive &#8212; which occurs because the healthcare market is not a free market.</p> 
<p>As another example of a non-free market, lawyers make sure that each state's probate process is very difficult to handle without the assistance of a lawyer, and then horror stories about probate cases motivate families who own expensive homes to pay a lawyer to create a trust that bypasses the probate process.</p> 
<p>Interestingly the makers of artificial sweeteners have made it illegal for the herb <i>stevia</i> to be displayed next to artificial sweeteners in grocery stores.&#160; This separation makes it difficult for consumers to find out about this healthier natural alternative.</p> 
<p>The biggest campaign contributors say they want a free market in industries other than their own, while they successfully push for non-free-market barriers that obstruct their competitors in their own industry.&#160; This pattern is repeated in each industry, especially in the following industries that make huge campaign contributions: finance, insurance, healthcare, legal services, telecommunications, agribusiness, and defense.&#160; These industries lack truly free markets, which enables the businesses in them to charge excessively high prices for their unnecessarily inferior products and services.</p> 
<h1>What Really Matters</h1> 
<p>It's important to realize that the economic strength of a nation is rooted in high levels of inventing and innovating.&#160; To fully appreciate this connection, let's look back into history about 2,000 years.&#160; At that time inventors in China invented gunpowder (for non-gun uses), the rudder for a large ship, the magnetic compass, a symbol for zero, and aspects of the printing press.&#160; Later, Arabic and then European civilizations copied these inventions from China and used them to increase their prosperity.&#160; Most notably Europeans used guns and large ships to acquire gold and silver mines, and more land, laborers, and markets (customers).</p> 
<p>Starting in the 1700s a spirit of innovation began in England and spread to other European nations.&#160; During this period Europeans invented water-powered looms for weaving cloth, railroad trains powered by steam engines, the internal-combustion engine, and the automobile.&#160; Each of these inventions greatly increased Europe's prosperity.&#160; However, that prosperity was limited by European governments fighting one another, culminating in World War One.</p> 
<p>Far away, democracy in the United States fostered a spirit of innovation among U.S. inventors whose contributions greatly increased U.S. prosperity.&#160; In particular, Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin, Robert McCormick (the father of Cyrus McCormick) invented the horse-drawn reaper, Thomas Edison and his workers discovered a filament material (carbonized bamboo) that made light bulbs last for many hours instead of a few minutes, Alexander Graham Bell and Elisha Grey each independently invented the telephone (but Bell got to the patent office first), Henry Ford increased the speed of the automobile assembly line (from a day and a half to 90 minutes for each automobile), Orville and Wilbur Wright invented the first airplane that didn't immediately crash, Nikola Tesla invented the alternating-current (AC) electric motor and AC electric-power distribution technologies and key components of radio technology, and many U.S. inventors developed television technology and computer technology.&#160; These and many other inventions provided dramatic increases in prosperity for many people throughout the United States &#8212; although typically not for the inventors themselves.</p> 
<p>Since then corporations have used campaign contributions to persuade politicians in Congress to change the patent system to their advantage.&#160; The result is that individual inventors can no longer earn a living by inventing.&#160; As an example, a woman mortgaged her family's house to raise the money she needed to pay a patent attorney to obtain a patent on a simple but useful invention.&#160; Alas, the patent now only serves to protect her business from being sued by the large corporation that illegally makes and sells what she invented.&#160; She can't sue the infringing corporation because the corporation can, and probably would, counter-sue her in a way that would bankrupt her.&#160; As a further irony, the infringing corporation uses the early design from her patent application, even though she has improved the design for her own manufacturing business.</p> 
<p>Using campaign contributions, corporations have convinced politicians that research-and-development departments within corporations are where most inventions commonly arise.&#160; Although corporations produce lots of minor inventions, the major inventions that produce widespread prosperity typically come from individuals working on their own.&#160; For legal reasons relating to patent law, it is difficult for corporations to hire these inventors.&#160; As further barriers, corporate managers don't know how to identify and manage productive inventors.&#160; For example, the individual at Hewlett-Packard who developed the first reliable inkjet printer cartridge was given development space in a storage closet and some extra spare time, but only after he had already achieved some success working on the project by himself.&#160; As an example of the management challenges, when IBM decided to enter the personal-computer market, it set up a separate off-site building for the product engineers to work in, and it had to isolate these engineers from the normal IBM management structure in order to accomplish in months what otherwise would take years.</p> 
<p>A simple solution to the patent-law problem would be to create a second kind of patent, one that accommodates the needs of individuals rather than corporations.&#160; If you're interested in the details, they are at the SolutionsCreative.com website, within the <i>Hope For The Future</i> online booklet.&#160; For now what's important is that there are many individuals who have come up with advances in technology and product design that would significantly boost economic prosperity, and they would like to patent their inventions and protect their patents from infringement.</p> 
<p>Unfortunately, because of the way the patent system works, most individual inventors who try to profit from their inventions usually get consumed by drawn-out court battles.&#160; As a classic example, Wilbur Wright died before Orville Wright finally won their most important legal case &#8212; in which a competitor copied their airplane technology without paying any royalties.</p> 
<p>During the past few decades the corporate-influenced changes in the patent system have made it even more difficult for an individual or small business to protect a patent from infringement by a large corporation.&#160; When an inventor is able to &#8220;successfully&#8221; sue a large corporation for infringement, the payment to the inventor is deflated because the inventor needs to team up with a competing corporation that can afford to pay the court costs.&#160; Even if an inventor sells a patent to a corporation, the price is deflated because there are legal, although unethical, ways a large corporation can undermine the inventor's patent.&#160; These unfairnesses greatly reduce the incentive for an inventor to spend countless hours developing an invention into a marketable product.</p> 
<p>Adding a second kind of patent would foster the development of many major inventions from individual inventors.&#160; The second kind of patent would allow any corporation to pay a royalty fee to the U.S. government, and these corporations would do what corporations do best, namely manufacture and sell products and services, and fight legal battles.&#160; From the prosperity perspective, this approach would provide a healthy flow of ideas to corporations from the many creative individuals in the United States who are the modern-day equivalents of Nikola Tesla, the Wright brothers, and Alexander Graham Bell.</p> 
<p>The importance of inventions in achieving prosperity helps us appreciate that prosperity cannot be achieved simply by redistributing wealth.&#160; That's what communism and socialism unsuccessfully attempted to achieve.&#160; And too often U.S. politicians make the same mistake of attempting to increase prosperity by simply redistributing wealth.&#160; Widespread prosperity more often comes from creating desirable things that previously didn't exist, such as time-saving new tools, useful new furniture designs, entertaining new books, beautiful new music, useful new software, improved communication processes, better ways to manage small business loans, and anything else that in any way makes life more enjoyable.</p> 
<p>Copyright laws are mostly adequate for protecting books, music, and software.&#160; (Recently corporations and copyright lawyers have been attempting to make changes that undermine protection for the writers and artists who do the actual creating, yet so far the damage has not been severe.)&#160; In contrast, patent laws are not adequate for protecting inventions created by individuals.&#160; Unfortunately, until corporate campaign contributions become less influential in election results, individual inventors do not have the political clout it takes to steer Congress in this wiser, less shortsighted, direction.</p> 
<h1>Moving Crime Out Of Fashion</h1> 
<p>Reducing crime can, in more ways than one, also lead to increased prosperity.</p> 
<p>As mentioned earlier, today we benefit from much less crime.&#160; Robberies and murders occur much less frequently today than in the former days of European tyrants.&#160; Part of the crime reduction is due to wealthy people carrying credit cards instead of gold and silver coins, and due to law-enforcement officers now using electronic technology.&#160; More importantly, democratic governments have eliminated unwise laws &#8212; such as openly discriminating against some religions and putting debtors in prison &#8212; that previously fostered crime.</p> 
<p>So how will crime be further reduced in the future?&#160; Part of the solution will be to add another rating to movies and computer games.&#160; This new movie-and-game rating will indicate how many years a person would spend in prison if they were to do everything shown in the movie or game.</p> 
<p>Yes, if you haven't heard it before, the idea is humorous.&#160; That's because creative ideas and humor both involve a sudden unexpected shift in perspective.</p> 
<p>With this fresh perspective, notice that the years-in-prison &#8212; or YIP &#8212; movie-and-game rating teaches people, especially young people, that what's shown on a screen is not necessarily acceptable in real life.&#160; This educational approach is very different from punishing crime after it happens, which is what politicians naturally focus on.&#160; Also notice that this rating is a form of education that takes place outside of schools, and it accompanies the movies and games in which many impressionable young people learn about crime.&#160; And, as with many solutions that are overlooked by politicians, adding the YIP rating will be very inexpensive.</p> 
<p>Additional details about this idea are described at the SolutionsCreative.com website.</p> 
<p>One of the common objections to the YIP rating is that some unethical activities are not illegal and some illegal activities are not unethical.&#160; Actually this gap between laws and the principles of ethics is an advantage, not a disadvantage.&#160; The gap calls attention to some punishments that are not strict enough and some punishments that are too strict.&#160; An historic example of a not-strict-enough punishment was the slap on the hand that was formerly given to drunk drivers, and now stricter punishments have dramatically reduced the frequency, and fatalities, of drunk driving.&#160; To the extent that citizens and media call attention to the gaps between laws and ethics, politicians will be motivated to bring laws closer in line with the principles of ethics.&#160; To the extent that more and more parents can say, &#8220;Yes the laws are fair,&#8221; fewer parents will tell their children that some laws are made to be broken.&#160; With fewer laws being controversial, law-enforcement efforts will get more assistance from citizens.&#160; Fairer laws?&#160; This is another long-overdue political change.</p> 
<p>This future change is similar to the changes that reduced crime from the high levels that existed in European tyrannies.&#160; In those tyrannies some laws were amazingly unfair.&#160; As an example, at one time in Ireland a law specified that if a Protestant offered to buy a horse from a Catholic, the Catholic had to sell the horse at whatever price was offered.&#160; Living under those kinds of unfair laws promoted disobeying laws.&#160; In a similar way, to the extent that some of today's laws are unfair, some people think that disobeying laws is somewhat respectable.</p> 
<p>As for its link to prosperity, less crime reduces the money and resources that otherwise are needed to police streets, catch criminals, guard prisoners, heal gunshot wounds, fix broken windows, and handle criminal court cases.</p> 
<h1>Fostering Hope</h1> 
<p>Let's look at another source of future prosperity.&#160; Let's call it optimism.&#160; Economists and investors are very familiar with the fact that consumer optimism, which is officially measured as <i><b>consumer confidence</b></i>, significantly influences stock prices.&#160; When consumers are optimistic and nothing else is going on, stock prices usually go up.&#160; When consumers are pessimistic and nothing else is going on, stock prices usually go down.&#160; For example, after Congress chose to use taxpayer's money for the bailout of the 1980s savings and loan scandal, stock prices paused in their upward trend.&#160; In the 1990s optimistic expectations for profitable Internet-related businesses caused stock prices to go up quickly.</p> 
<p>Here's another way to think about the connection between optimism and economic prosperity.&#160; Let's follow the path of a dollar, starting with an employee receiving it as part of his salary.&#160; If the employee is concerned about being able to pay for food and rent in future months, he's likely to hang on to the dollar and perhaps not spend it until the following year.&#160; In contrast, let's suppose he's optimistic about the future and as a result spends the dollar as part of buying a new piece of furniture.&#160; The furniture store passes the dollar, as part of a paycheck, to one of its employees.&#160; Let's suppose the furniture-store employee is also optimistic about the future and she buys a book instead of checking it out from the library.&#160; In the optimistic scenario the same dollar gets transferred four times so it counts as four dollars towards the nation's gross domestic product.&#160; In the pessimistic scenario the dollar is counted only once because it's transferred only once.&#160; From this illustration you can see that economic prosperity isn't just a matter of how much money is in circulation.&#160; It's also a matter of how quickly money is passed along.&#160; Optimism speeds up the flow of money, and pessimism slows it down.</p> 
<p>With this insight you can better appreciate why the economy is negatively affected by each new scandal in Washington DC, each unwise decision made in Congress, each politician being excessively influenced by campaign contributions, each new case of corruption, and each election in which the choices on the ballot are disappointing.&#160; Frustrated voters are not as powerless as government insiders seem to believe.&#160; Fortunately, to the extent that election results are fair and representative of what voters really want, prosperity follows.&#160; Unfortunately, the current political conditions cause voters to be frequently frustrated and discouraged, so further increases in prosperity are stifled until higher levels of democracy are adopted.</p> 
<h1>Not Wasting Resources</h1> 
<p>Let's consider a more obvious link between prosperity and wise government, namely the fact that a government can spend money wisely or unwisely.&#160; European tyrants of the past wasted lots of money.&#160; They wasted money on lavish possessions and parties.&#160; They wasted money on wars, such as the ones between England and France, for purposes such as revenge, religious differences, and stealing another tyrant's wealth.&#160; And they wasted money on armies that were needed to suppress people who wanted to overthrow the tyranny.</p> 
<p>In current times wealthy people and corporations now waste lots of money on political advertisements that promote candidates and political agendas that most voters dislike.&#160; Just as money spent on foolish wars wastes money that could be used to fuel growth in prosperity, money spent on dysfunctional political games also wastes money that could fuel economic growth.</p> 
<p>In current times political parties take turns being in control of government.&#160; This shifting of power back and forth between political parties causes politicians to waste time and money shifting laws back and forth between the biases of each party.&#160; In turn, the changing laws cause businesses to waste resources adapting to each change.&#160; Of course individuals get confused and frustrated dealing with each change.&#160; As a consequence, prosperity suffers under the schizophrenic changes.</p> 
<p>Is the money collected from taxes spent more wisely today than in tyrannical times?&#160; Tyrants of the past channeled lots of tax-collected money directly into the pockets of aristocratic families who militarily, religiously, and financially supported the tyranny.&#160; Democratic governments of today channel lots of money directly into the pockets of businesses who contribute lots of money to election campaigns.&#160; A simple example is the common practice of awarding military contracts to corporations that financially back winning Congressional candidates.</p> 
<p>We've come a long way.&#160; Democracies don't waste as much money as tyrannies, but there is still lots of wasteful spending.&#160; In the future, fairer election results will further reduce wasteful government spending, with resulting increases in prosperity.</p> 
<h1>Dramatically Improved Public Education</h1> 
<p>There is perhaps no greater waste than the minds of children who are limited by the current inadequacies in public education.&#160; No doubt you realize there is a link between the quality of education and financial prosperity, especially for those who are educated.&#160; So what can state-level politicians do to improve public education?</p> 
<p>Politicians need to recognize the foolishness of spending lots of money on building and maintaining school buildings and forcing children to sit in classrooms without also putting at the head of the classrooms teachers who are models for what we want those children to become.&#160; If we fail to do this the message given to students is, &#8220;We want you to become highly successful people, but we aren't putting any highly successful people in the classroom for you to learn from.&#8221; This mistake must be corrected by putting into classrooms, perhaps on a rotating basis, elite teachers who are recruited from the people who normally choose to become well-respected doctors, lawyers, scientists, and business professionals.&#160; That will only happen when there is a wisely designed, peer-based way to identify and honor elite teachers.&#160; These elite teachers would serve as role models for the students.&#160; Elite teachers also would serve as mentors for average teachers who want to become elite teachers.&#160; (Clarification: Many existing teachers would qualify as elite teachers, but they are not yet paid and respected significantly more than other teachers.)</p> 
<p>The other missing ingredient in quality public education is the wise choice of curriculum.&#160; Unfortunately state and federal mandates increasingly shift education toward teaching students how to do well on standardized tests.&#160; Of course reading, writing, and math skills are important to learn, but this narrow focus shifts students away from learning the mental skills that are necessary for the best-paying and most-important jobs.</p> 
<p>To appreciate the current shortsightedness in curriculum, consider that within a couple of decades computers will be able to achieve basic reading and listening comprehension, quickly retrieve relevant information from reference materials, write and speak perfectly spelled and grammatically correct sentences, and solve algebra homework problems.&#160; Remember that computers already can do arithmetic, understand spoken words (most of the words in this book were dictated into a computer), check spelling and grammar, speak on the telephone, robotically manufacture products, and crudely simulate intelligent conversation.&#160; The professional jobs of the future will be open to people who can do what computers cannot do: make good business decisions, manage employees, wisely allocate resources, solve real-life problems, design new products, invent, troubleshoot new problems, compose quality music, write creatively, and cure diseases.</p> 
<p>Which important thinking skills do schools neglect to teach?&#160; I've described many of them in my book titled <i><b>The Creative Problem Solver's Toolbox</b></i>, so that book provides a good start in identifying current curriculum deficiencies.&#160; Why do schools typically fail to teach creative-problem-solving skills?&#160; One reason is that homework problems are very different from real-life problems.&#160; (Ten such differences are listed in that book.)&#160; Perhaps most importantly a teacher must be a good creative problem solver in order to teach these skills to students, but the field of education under-appreciates people with these skills.</p> 
<p>When public schools finally learn how to operate in ways that correctly identify and appropriately honor elite teachers, and when public schools finally teach higher-level thinking skills in addition to the basics, widespread prosperity will follow, the world will experience far fewer problems, and the world will change in yet other positive ways that most people living today cannot imagine.</p> 
<h1>Using Resources Wisely</h1> 
<p>Let's bring together several topics here.&#160; Whether politicians realize it or not, the ultimate goal of government is to use resources wisely.&#160; That goes beyond just not wasting resources.&#160; And it goes beyond thinking of money as the primary resource.&#160; The minds of children in public education and the minds of inventors also are important resources.&#160; An improved public education system and an improved patent system will enable these valuable resources to provide what corporations are currently missing.&#160; Specifically, now that manufacturing industries are placed where labor and raw materials are less expensive, the U.S. economy is increasingly dependent on the thinking skills of its employees and the supply of ideas for inventions and innovations.&#160; Taxing economy-strengthening <i>maker</i> businesses less than economy-weakening <i>taker</i> businesses will attract more of the best-trained minds into jobs that will most dramatically strengthen the U.S. economy.</p> 
<p>An important strategy for using resources wisely is to recognize that the best solutions often solve multiple problems.&#160; Consider the problems of dwindling supplies of oil, polluted air from automobiles, disposal of radioactive waste, and &#8220;global warming.&#8221;&#160; Politicians tend to focus on such problems one at a time.&#160; Yet the future of energy lies in a direction that will solve all of these problems.&#160; What is the solution?</p> 
<p>The long-term solution to energy is to manufacture fuels using water, air, and solar energy.&#160; In addition to hydrogen, which scientists already know how to generate using solar energy, the manufactured fuels will include liquid fuels that will be used to power automobiles and future vehicles.&#160; The byproduct of manufacturing these fuels is oxygen, which makes the process far more environmentally safe compared to nuclear reactors that produce radioactive waste.&#160; The component of air that's consumed in the manufacturing process is carbon dioxide, so this consumption will begin to reverse the atmospheric buildup of carbon dioxide that can cause global climate change.&#160; This future technology, which is called <i><b>synthetic hydrocarbon fuel</b></i>, is not yet funded by the U.S. government, mostly because large energy corporations do not want the competition.</p> 
<p>What will it take to shift over to this counter-polluting source of energy?&#160; The minds of individual inventors and the minds of children who are now in school, both of which are currently being wasted &#8212; because of unwise decisions by politicians who are elected using primitive voting methods that are too easily influenced by money.</p> 
<h1>Peace Ahead</h1> 
<p>The voting methods currently used to elect politicians in the United States and throughout Europe are primitive.&#160; To better appreciate how primitive, let's consider where voting came from.&#160; Before the days of voting, humans fought one another as a way to resolve conflicts.&#160; Whichever side won the fight got what it wanted, and the losing side was forced to go along with what the winning side wanted.&#160; At that point, the concept of a majority was implicitly understood because the side that had more fighters usually won, and the side with fewer fighters usually lost.</p> 
<p>Back when fights were between people of different races or between cultures that dressed differently, there was no need to do any formal counting.&#160; But as humans became civilized, lived in houses, wore similar clothes, and more subtle differences &#8212; such as religion &#8212; made it harder to count the number of people on each side of a conflict, the formal act of voting was used with increasing frequency.&#160; Counting potential fighters in advance enabled some conflicts to be resolved without fighting, with the minority conceding defeat to the majority.&#160; If the numbers on each side were about the same and a compromise was unacceptable, one side or the other usually started a fight.&#160; So you can see that voting became a way of asking, &#8220;If we were to fight, who would win?&#8221; From this perspective you can see that voting arose as a more civilized way to resolve conflicts.</p> 
<p>The tradition of allowing only males to vote originated because they were the fighters.&#160; By the time of the European tyrannies, only men of wealth or power were allowed to vote.&#160; This made sense because wealth could be used to hire mercenaries and a tyrant could force his male subjects to fight.&#160; The founders of the United States dramatically extended the right to vote to include almost all free adult males, not just the wealthy ones.&#160; Since then the biggest innovations in democracy have been to extend the right to vote to male descendents of former slaves, adult males who were indirectly excluded (such as by requiring poll taxes), and then women.&#160; Now, in most democracies, nearly every adult citizen is allowed to vote.</p> 
<p>Although lots of progress has been made in terms of who can vote, almost no progress has been made in terms of the kind of voting that's done.&#160; Voting is still done in ways that amount to counting how many people are on each side of a conflict, implicitly recognizing that if there were a fight between the two sides, the side with a majority would win, so the majority side gets what they want.</p> 
<p>Yes, this primitive method of voting does work.&#160; In fact, voting, more than any other innovation throughout history, accounts for why so many people can live together in close quarters without fighting.&#160; To appreciate this benefit, consider the fact that for more than 200 years the individual states that make up the United States have fought one another only once, and it lasted only five years.&#160; In contrast, in the times of European tyrannies, wars were going on almost continuously, and those wars often lasted for decades each, with one war between England and France lasting for more than 100 years.&#160; Now that most European countries have become democracies, fighting between them has ended.</p> 
<p>In the future, when advanced voting methods have been adopted, fighting and warfare will become even less common than today.&#160; In other words, as voting methods become less primitive and more advanced, civilization will become increasingly peaceful.&#160; After all, fighting and warfare are immature ways to resolve a conflict, and voting is a civilized, wiser way to resolve a conflict.</p> 
<p>On a global basis, the few remaining places where fighting and warfare continue (or continued until recently) are places where our current primitive voting methods do not produce fair results.&#160; In the case of Northern Ireland, the conflict was between two groups of people who are so different in religion and priorities that no Parliament, no matter how its members are elected, could arrive at decisions that would be acceptable to both sides.&#160; In the case of Iraq, the conflict is between three very different groups of people with religious and cultural differences, and the voting methods used in the new Iraqi Parliament are too primitive to resolve three-way conflicts in ways that are fair.&#160; In the case of Israel, it isn't possible to count, in a way that is meaningful and fair, votes from around the world for the purpose of resolving the three-way conflict &#8212; between Jews, Christians, and Muslims &#8212; regarding the city of Jerusalem, which is holy to all three religions.&#160; Only when much more advanced voting methods have been developed and adopted will it be possible to begin to resolve (or fully resolve) the conflicts in these global hot spots.</p> 
<p>It is important to understand that the conflicts in some of these global hot spots cannot be resolved just by using VoteFair ranking in elections.&#160; Election-method reforms need to be followed by Parliaments (and Congress) adopting advanced voting methods that are used to decide which laws to pass.&#160; In addition, Parliamentary (and Congressional) committees need to use voting methods that increase the influence of the minority of committee members, without which a committee typically drafts an unwise and corrupt law.&#160; Combined, these reforms will dramatically reduce the corruption that exists in most democracies.&#160; Only in the absence of corruption can democratic governments have enough credibility to reform the unfairnesses that fuel the conflicts in the most challenging global hot spots.</p> 
<h1>Future Legislative Voting</h1> 
<p>Let's take a peek at how Parliaments and U.S. Congress will vote to decide which proposed laws (<i>bills</i>) can best resolve contentious religious issues such as abortion, and deep-rooted socioeconomic issues such as living-wage rights, that are multi-dimensional and too complex to be resolved using the primitive one-dimensional voting methods now used in Parliaments and Congress.</p> 
<p>In this advanced voting by legislators (Congressmen or members of Parliament) the goal is to identify a group of compatible proposals that can be combined into a proposed law.&#160; So in this kind of voting the choices are proposals, not candidates.&#160; And instead of filling a specified number of winning positions, the process needs to add more proposals until the remaining proposals are all incompatible with the chosen proposals.</p> 
<p>As a simple example of this kind of voting, suppose that the religious issue is divorce, and suppose the voting were being done in an Irish Parliament where Protestants want divorce to be legal and Catholics want divorce to be illegal.&#160; There would be proposals for both of these positions, yet also there could be a proposal that if a couple marries in a Catholic church then they cannot get divorced, and there could be a proposal that if a couple marries somewhere other than in a Catholic church then they can get divorced.&#160; Each legislator would rank all these proposals according to which proposals they support and which they oppose, and the ranking would indicate how strongly they support or oppose each proposal.&#160; A calculation that uses an enhanced version of VoteFair representation ranking could, without knowing what the proposals actually say, identify that a proposed law that would be acceptable to the most legislators would be the two proposals that depend on whether the marriage is done in a Catholic church.&#160; Specifically the calculations would recognize that these two proposals have broader support, and they are not incompatible with each other, and all the other proposals are incompatible with these two proposals.</p> 
<p>During the deliberation process any legislator can submit a new proposal at any time, and any legislator at any time can change their ranking of the proposals.&#160; The calculations are repeated automatically after any change.&#160; This ongoing process allows the legislators to essentially negotiate continuously.&#160; Only when the results stop changing significantly would the combination of proposals be combined into a proposed law that is officially voted on for approval or disapproval.&#160; Only if a majority, or possibly at least sixty percent, of the legislators approve it would the proposed law become a law.</p> 
<p>The legislator's task of ranking all the proposals will be much more challenging than filling out a ranked ballot.&#160; Yet if VoteFair ranking is used to elect representatives of the future, legislators will easily have the intelligence needed to handle that kind of legislative voting.&#160; For this reason VoteFair ranking needs to be adopted for use in elections before this more advanced kind of legislative voting method can be adopted.</p> 
<p>This kind of voting, which can be called <b>VoteFair <i>negotiation</i> ranking</b>, requires knowing which proposals are incompatible with which other proposals.&#160; That knowledge can be acquired through simple compatible-versus-incompatible voting.&#160; Alternatively, if this voting process were used in a business setting or in an arbitration case, an impartial facilitator could make the decisions about incompatibility.</p> 
<p>A demonstration version of VoteFair negotiation ranking is available at the <i><b>NegotiationTool.com</b></i> website.&#160; It uses an enhanced version of <b>VoteFair <i>representation</i> ranking</b> that was developed after the print edition of this book was published.</p> 
<p>(If you want to know how this enhanced version of VoteFair representation ranking works, here is a very brief explanation.&#160; The first two most-representative choices would remain the same as the un-enhanced version, which keeps the enhanced version compatible with this book's recommended uses for U.S. elections.&#160; At the third position the calculation process identifies to what extent each legislator is, or is not, well-represented by the choices that so far have &#8220;won&#8221; a position in the representation ranking.&#160; If enough legislators are sufficiently under-represented, and if they express sufficient support for another proposal, then that other proposal is inserted into the representation ranking.&#160; Then the process of VoteFair representation ranking resumes with finding the next-most popular and next-most representative choices before possibly inserting additional choices that are supported by under-represented minority legislators.&#160; The degree to which each proposal is approved or disapproved by each legislator would be determined by how high or low that proposal is ranked by that legislator, with adjustments that defeat the tactic of highly ranking unpopular proposals.)</p> 
<p>Another use for this enhanced version of VoteFair representation ranking is in Parliamentary elections that use proportional representation.&#160; This ranking can be used to create the <i>open party list</i> that specifies the order in which party-specific seats are filled.&#160; If you don't know what this means, just ignore this additional use.</p> 
<h1>Moving Beyond Primitive Voting Methods</h1> 
<p>Now that you better understand that improvements in democracy lead to improvements in prosperity and peace, it's natural to wonder, &#8220;What holds back each level of civilization from progressing to the next level of democracy?&#8221;</p> 
<p>Back in the pre-democratic days of tyranny, tyrants used well-equipped armies to violently suppress any suggestion that the method of government was unfair.&#160; Now, in democratic countries we have freedom of speech, so what is it that supports today's unfair arrangement in which the biggest campaign contributors have excessive influence in choosing politicians and political agendas?</p> 
<p>The answer is ignorance.&#160; It is only through ignorance &#8212; not physical force, and not political force &#8212; that voters are unable to elect the leaders and political agendas they want.&#160; This ignorance is widespread among both voters and campaign contributors.&#160; Very few people understand why campaign contributions so easily influence politics.&#160; Let's end that ignorance right now.</p> 
<p>At election time when we mark a ballot, we're only allowed to mark a single choice as our favorite.&#160; This seems to be fair, especially in U.S. general elections where there are only two practical choices, namely one Republican candidate and one Democratic candidate.&#160; The reason it seems fair is the unfairness is hidden in primary elections.&#160; It's hidden there because the winner of a Republican primary election is always a Republican, and the winner of a Democratic primary election is always a Democrat.&#160; What easily gets overlooked is the fact that the money-backed winner of a primary election often wins without being preferred by a majority of voters.&#160; The fact that secondary preferences are not collected from voters makes this unfairness difficult to notice and difficult to prove.</p> 
<p>Many people recognize the unfairness of primary-election winners nearly always being the kind of politician who is preferred by the biggest campaign contributors.&#160; Unfortunately, election-result critics are often distracted by less-important unfairness issues such as vote-counting mistakes and unethical campaign tactics.</p> 
<p>It would seem that election unfairness would be easy to overcome if a more popular politician were to get his or her name on the primary ballot.&#160; But that seldom happens.&#160; When it does, the more popular politician usually loses.&#160; Why?&#160; Because campaign strategists know how to use money to defeat such a politician.&#160; As explained in this book, the strategy involves taking advantage of the fact that voters can only mark one choice in each race, even when there are three or four candidates in the race.&#160; Specifically the strategy involves making sure there is only one candidate who is favored by the biggest campaign contributors, and making sure there is more than one candidate who is favored by the majority of discouraged citizens.&#160; Combined with lots of well-designed advertising, the inevitable result is &#8212; surprise! &#8212; the heavily financed politician wins the primary election.</p> 
<p>How can that be?&#160; It's because the votes for the heavily financed politician outnumber the votes for either of the preferred politicians.&#160; But if we look further we see that the failure to collect secondary preferences leaves us without the information we need to get fair results.&#160; Why doesn't this unfairness get more attention?&#160; Because few people think about adding together the votes for the preferred candidates to realize that a majority of voters actually prefer someone other than the winner.</p> 
<p>The idea of using ranked ballots so that voters can indicate a second choice, a third choice, and so on isn't new.&#160; This idea has been repeatedly proposed in the United States and other nations during the 1800s and 1900s.&#160; But now something significant has changed.&#160; We now have computers that can handle the calculations that are necessary to get fair results from ranked ballots.&#160; Before computers came along the best we could do was something called instant-runoff voting, but that method doesn't always produce fair results, so it never became popular.&#160; Now it's possible to use a fair method called VoteFair ranking.</p> 
<p>The advantage of VoteFair ranking is that it correctly identifies the most popular candidate, even in a race that involves lots of candidates.&#160; To achieve this fairness, VoteFair ranking takes into account all the preferences of all the voters &#8212; which is something that no other voting method does.&#160; Adopting this simple concept, namely taking into account all the preferences of all the voters, is long overdue.</p> 
<p>The only barrier to using VoteFair ranking has been the need to calculate the hundreds of thousands of additions, tallies, and comparisons that are needed to take into account all the preferences of all the voters.&#160; But today's widespread availability of computers has removed this barrier.</p> 
<p>Of course voters deserve a way to ensure that the results of VoteFair ranking are fair.&#160; Fortunately, full VoteFair ranking results include something called a tally table.&#160; This table of numbers allows a disgruntled voter to look at the number of voters who prefer the winning candidate over their favorite candidate and compare this number with the number of voters who have the opposite preference.&#160; In other words, just by comparing two numbers, any voter can verify that the winning candidate is truly more popular than their favorite.&#160; Doing this comparison with all the candidates reveals that the candidate who is identified by VoteFair ranking as the most popular is indeed preferred by a majority of voters.</p> 
<p>Our ignorance is now gone.&#160; We as citizens and voters now know how to take democracy out of its current unfairness and take it up to the next level of fairness.&#160; We now know that ranked ballots and VoteFair ranking can lead us to fairer election results.</p> 
<h1>Closing Of The Closing</h1> 
<p>It's important to remember that higher levels of prosperity arise from higher levels of democracy.&#160; This connection involves fairer taxes, truly free markets, increased appreciation for inventions and innovations, fairer laws, wiser uses of money, and dramatically improved public education.&#160; Each of these changes will arise naturally from higher levels of democracy.</p> 
<p>You now know how to begin making the change to achieve the next level of democracy.&#160; It's as simple as insisting that when you mark a ballot you are allowed to indicate not only your first choice, but also your second choice, third choice, and so on.&#160; These ranked ballots are the key to fairer election results and increased prosperity.&#160; To make sure the preference information is used correctly, some voters need to look at the ballot counts in the tally table to verify that the announced winner is really preferred by more than half the voters.</p> 
<p>There are no excuses for civilization continuing to wallow in the problems that now confront us.&#160; Your ignorance is gone.&#160; Soon the ignorance that supports today's unfair voting methods also will be gone from most citizens in most democracies.&#160; The opposite of ignorance is knowledge, and as the saying goes, knowledge is power.&#160; Use that power to insist on being allowed to indicate on a ballot not just your first choice, but also your second choice, third choice, and so on.</p> 
<p>There are bigger problems coming in the future and we won't be able to solve them if we can't solve the easier ones that stump today's politicians.</p>

<h1>Testimonials For VoteFair Ranking</h1> 
<p class="classQuote">&#8220;Our club is extremely pleased with multiple aspects of the VoteFair system.&#160; The ability to vote online meant an extremely high voter turnout, approximately 70-75%!&#160; Equally as important are the concepts underlying the VoteFair system.&#160; Using a comparison system instead of the more common method of voting for a single candidate we came out knowing that we had voted in the candidates our club members preferred to have in the seats.&#160; Not only were there a number of good candidates, which could have split a conventional vote to the point of electing a non-preferred candidate, but our club is essentially split between 2 facilities and some candidates were known better in one or other of the facilities.&#160; VoteFair [ranking] gave us the ability to balance that out transparently.&#160; Thanks!&#8221;&#160; ...&#160; &#8220;Our organization has had several successful elections (of club officers) in the past few years, including an annual election a couple of weeks ago with the most candidates ever, and all the results have been recognized as very fair.&#160; Thanks again for keeping VoteFair going!&#8221;</p>
