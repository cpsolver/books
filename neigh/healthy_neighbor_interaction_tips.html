<h1>Healthy Neighbor Interaction Tips</h1>
<p>Here are some suggestions for how to interact with neighbors in ways that promote cooperation and increase the benefits of living in your neighborhood.</p>
<ol>

<li>
Behave at a higher level of ethics than the person you are interacting with.&nbsp; For example, if someone yells at you, they are inviting you to speak louder, but remember that the loudest person is the most immature.&nbsp; As another example, do not lie, but this does not mean to never lie, because if someone points a gun at you then they have given you permission to lie.
</li>

<li>
Ethical behavior must be built on a foundation of not doing bad things, because doing several good deeds does not compensate for one bad deed.
</li>

<li>
If two people do not get along with each other, both people are behaving childishly.&nbsp; It is quite rare for a conflict to arise between one person who is behaving maturely and another person who is behaving childishly.
</li>

<li>
Make choices that demonstrate a commitment to the goals that you claim are your goals.&nbsp; The result is that others will regard you as worthy of their trust.
</li>

<li>
When you choose who to trust, judge others by their actions, not by their words.
</li>

<li>
Avoid making promises.&nbsp; If you do make a promise, then keep it.
</li>

<li>
You don't need to be religious to recognize that it is not good to lie, steal, be greedy, behave with sexual misconduct, or use violence.&nbsp; Instead, behave with fairness and cooperation.
</li>

<li>
Recognize that something can be important only if other things are less important.&nbsp; This means don't be greedy, which is a word that applies to someone who tries to get too much for themself at the expense of others.&nbsp; When you seek to achieve something important, pay attention to options that involve making sacrifices in areas that are less important.&nbsp; If everything seems important, begin to identify what is less important by identifying your 5 most important goals, and then identifying which 3 of those goals are most important, and then identifying which single goal is truly your most important goal.
</li>

<li>
If there is a conflict with another person, ask to schedule time to talk with them.&nbsp; Do not communicate in any other way besides in person, because misunderstandings easily arise in written communication, and phone conversations are more appropriate for people with whom you do not have a conflict.&nbsp; When you communicate in person, state facts, not judgments.&nbsp; For example, saying "your hedge is too tall" is an opinion, which is a form of judgment, but saying "I think your hedge is to tall" is a fact.&nbsp; When communicating about a conflict, recognize that you cannot control the other person, you can only control yourself.&nbsp; For example, it is unwise to say "if you don't trim your hedge then I will find a way to retaliate," and it is far wiser to say something like "I am going to look online to find the legal height limit for a hedge," and not try to predict what you will do if the hedge exceeds the legal limit.&nbsp; Your goal is to talk to the other person with a desire to understand their perspective.&nbsp; The better you understand their perspective, the better the two of you can identify a resolution that meets the needs of both people.
</li>

<li>
Understand that cooperation promotes economic prosperity for the people who cooperate.&nbsp; Conflict and competition are sometimes used to motivate people who are unwilling to cooperate, but the conflict and competition itself undermines economic prosperity.&nbsp; If it might seem that in the past warfare has increased economic growth, recognize that the conflict motivates a higher level of cooperation within the people on one side of the conflict, and it is that cooperation, not the conflict, that increases economic prosperity.
Cooperation among neighbors can be for the purpose of competing against people far away, such as one city competing to become more livable, more desirable as a tourist destination, and more prosperous, but this competition may be against cities in other nations, not against neighboring cities.
</li>

<li>
Build relationships based on actions, not just based on words.
Judge people by their actions, not their words.&nbsp; When you ask for an opinion about another person, pay attention to examples of the person's behavior is more important than judgments such as "great" or "nice."
</li>

<li>
When you do a favor for another person, do not expect that you get to choose what they will do in return.
</li>

<li>
If you like something, say so, but if you dislike someone, be careful what you say.&nbsp; When you criticize someone, you are revealling that the same criticism, or a similar criticism, applies to you too.&nbsp; It's ironic, yet insightful, that we tend to criticize in others what we ourselves do, or don't do.
</li>

<li>
Avoid coalitions and alliances because they are often counter-productive.&nbsp; A coalition involves a promise that if a negative event happens, the participant will automatically choose a predetermined course of action.&nbsp; That is dysfunctional because the predetermined course of action is likely to be an unwise choice.&nbsp; If the coalition or alliance seems harmless because the triggering event "will never happen," a manipulative person easily becomes motivated to force the triggering event to happen.&nbsp; Always protect your future right to make a wise choice in any future situation.
If it seems appropriate to join an alliance or coalition, reserve the right to not do actions that are unethical.&nbsp; If you do not reserve the right to behave ethically, then an alliance or coalition tends to become corrupt, and corruption greatly reduces the benefits of the alliance.
If you join an alliance, make sure that it behaves like a community, and that it does not behave like a gang.&nbsp; A community has no boundaries, but a gang has its "turf;" a community is non-exclusive, whereas a gang is exclusive; a community is based on benefiting others, whereas a gang is based on doing harm; a community is symbiotic, whereas a gang is competitive.
Cliquishness is a form of an alliance, and cliquish behavior should be avoided because it is based on criticizing others as if they were the enemy.
</li>

<li>
Behave diplomatically.
</li>

<li>
When choosing which neighbors to interact with, it is useful to choose based on a mutual interest in the same activity, or a complementary activity.
</li>

<li>
The underlying principles of ethical behavior are: do not do to others what you would not want done to you, and do actions that benefit others if those actions do not significantly deplete your resources, and do not do actions that everyone wants to do but which would cause significant harm if everyone did them.
</li>

<li>
If your intent is to control another person, then spend more time listening, and less time talking.
</li>

<li>
Corruption and non-cooperation are related.&nbsp; Both involve at least some selfishness or greed.
</li>

<li>
Allying yourself with goals, not people, because typically people change their goals, or they have bigger goals that conflict with their stated goals.
</li>

<li>
Trustworthiness is only known in hindsight, after slowly growing based on experiences with the person.
</li>

<li>
Avoid keeping secrets, because a secret involves segregating people according to who can know the secret and who can't, and this segregation is a form of alliance.
</li>

<li>
If someone yells with anger directed to you, you can raise the volume of your voice, but not as loud, or with as much anger, as they have used.&nbsp; Use significantly less profanity (fewer cuss words) then used by the person you are talking to.
</li>

<li>
Never assume that you know what someone is thinking.&nbsp; Even if you ask them what they are thinking, and even if they believe they are being honest about what they are thinking, they may not themselves recognize what they are really thinking.
</li>

<li>
If someone smiles with their mouth, but not with their eyes, then beware.&nbsp; If one corner of a person's mouth moves up, then they are experiencing a feeling of contempt.&nbsp; If a person touches their nose as they say something, there's a good chance that they are thinking something different than what they are saying.
</li>

<li>
Instead of simply wanting to be appreciated by others, seek to benefit others.&nbsp; Your actions will be noticed.
</li>

<li>
If two people have done lots of favors for each other, do not try to decide which person "owes" the other.&nbsp; Instead, those people should try to make sure that both people have been pleased by the favors.
</li>

<li>
Avoid having expectations of what another person will or will not do.
</li>

<li>
Avoid trying to create a popularity contest, which is a focus on ego.&nbsp; Instead, focus on goals, and focus on roles.
</li>

<li>
When a neighbor causes harm &mdash; either emotionally, physically, or economically &mdash; remember that their choice of action probably comes from a place of weakness, not from an intention to harm you.
</li>

<li>
If you become aware that you have caused harm to a neighbor, express regret by apologizing.&nbsp; If you don't regret your choice of action, instead you can express regret that your action caused them harm.
</li>

<li>
If you do something that causes harm and you regret what you did, don't ask for forgiveness.&nbsp; That request is basically asking them to ignore or forget what you did.&nbsp; Accept that some loss of trust in you has already happened.
</li>

<li>
If someone causes harm to you, don't rush to forgive them.&nbsp; You need time to emotionally process the harm.&nbsp; You need time to gain better clarity about what happened.&nbsp; And you need time to consider how you might do things differently in the future.
</li>

<li>
If you choose to forgive someone, do it for your own benefit.&nbsp; Do not feel any obligation to inform the person you have forgiven.
</li>

<li>
If a neighbor tells you they forgive you for something you did, thank them for their forgiveness.&nbsp; Yet recognize you can never fully understand what kind of forgiveness they have in their mind.
</li>

<li>
Always remember that you can never know what is in someone else's mind.
</li>

<li>
Always remember that actions speak louder than words.
</li>

<li>
If a group of neighbors wants to make a decision by voting, do not use the voting methods that are currently used in governmental elections where each person can express support for just one choice when there are more than two choices.&nbsp; As a simple improvement, allow each person to approve or disapprove of each possible change, and regard the choice with the most approval support as the most popular change.&nbsp; Then use a separate round of voting to choose between that most popular change and not making any change.&nbsp; More advanced methods of voting are even better, but they require ranking the choices and using special software.
</li>
